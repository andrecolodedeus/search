<h1>Revelation</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Meaning of revelation</h2>

<p>Revelation may be defined as the communication of some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to a <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">rational</a> creature through means which are beyond the ordinary course of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> revealed may be such as are otherwise inaccessible to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> &#151; mysteries, which even when revealed, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of man is incapable of fully penetrating. But Revelation is not restricted to these. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may see fit to employ <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> means to affirm <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, the discovery of which is not <em>per se</em> beyond the powers of reason. The essence of Revelation lies in the fact that it is the direct speech of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to man. The mode of communication, however, may be mediate. Revelation does not cease to be such if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> message is delivered to us by a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, who alone is the recipient of the immediate communication. Such in brief is the account of Revelation given in the Constitution "De Fide Catholica" of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Lamentabili" (3 July, 1907), by its condemnation of a contrary proposition, declares that the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> proposes as revealed are "truths which have come down to us from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>" (<em>veritates e coelo delapsoe</em>) and not "an interpretation of religious facts which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> has acquired by its own strenuous efforts" (prop., 22). It will be seen that Revelation as thus explained differs clearly from: <ul> <li><em><a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">inspiration</a></em> such as is bestowed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on the author of a sacred book; for this, while involving a special illumination of the mind in virtue of which the recipient conceives such thoughts as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> desires him to commit to writing, does not necessarily suppose a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> communication of these <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>; <li>from the <em>illustrations</em> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may bestow from time to time upon any of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to bring home to the mind the import of some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of religion hitherto obscurely grasped; and, <li>from the <em><a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">Divine assistance</a></em> by which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> when acting as the supreme teacher of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is preserved from all <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> as to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. The function of this assistance is purely negative: it need not carry with it any positive gift of light to the mind. Much of the confusion in which the discussion of Revelation in non-Catholic works is involved arises from the neglect to distinguish it from one or other of these. </ul>

<p>During the past century the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has been called on to reject as <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> several views of Revelation irreconcilable with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. Three of these may here be noted. <ul> <li>The view of <a href="../cathen/07085a.htm">Anton Guenther</a> (1783-1863). This writer denied that Revelation could include mysteries strictly so-called, inasmuch as the human <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is capable of penetrating to the full all revealed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. He taught, further, that the meaning to be attached to revealed doctrines is undergoing constant change as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> grows and man's mind develops; so that the dogmatic formul&aelig; which are now <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> will gradually cease to be so. His writings were put on the Index in 1857, and his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> propositions definitively condemned in the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. <li>the <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernist</a> view (Loisy, Tyrrell). According to this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, there is no such thing as Revelation in the sense of a direct communication from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to man. The human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> reaching up towards the unknowable <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is ever endeavouring to interpret its sentiments in <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> formul&aelig; . The formul&aelig; it thus frames are our <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>. These can but symbolize the Unknowable; they can give us no real <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> regarding it. Such an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is manifestly subversive of all <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, and was explicitly condemned by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Lamentabili" and the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi" (8 Sept., 1907). <li>With the view just mentioned is closely connected the Pragmatist view of M. Leroy ("Dogme et Critique", Paris, 2nd ed. 1907). Like the <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernists</a>, he sees in revealed <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> simply the results of spiritual experience, but holds their value to lie not in the fact that they symbolize the Unknowable, but that they have practical value in pointing the way by which we may best enjoy experience of the Divine. This view was condemned in the same documents as the last mentioned. </ul>
<h2 id="section2">Possibility of revelation</h2>

<p>The possibility of Revelation as above explained has been strenuously denied from various points of view during the last century. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> held it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to issue special decrees on the subject in the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. Its antagonists may be divided into two classes according to the different standpoints from which they direct their attack, viz: <ul> <li><em><a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalists</a></em> (under this class we include both <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deist</a> and <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnostic</a> writers). Those who adopt this standpoint rely in the main on two fundamental objections: they either urge that the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> is impossible, and that Revelation involves <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> interposition on the part of the Deity; or they appeal to the autonomy of reason, which it is maintained can only accept as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> the results of its own activities. <li><em>Immanentists.</em> To this class may be assigned all those whose objections are based on <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kantian</a> and <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegelian</a> doctrines as to the subjective character of all our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. The views of these writers frequently involve a purely <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. But even those who repudiate <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a>, in place of the personal <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Ruler, and Judge of the world, whom <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> teaches, substitute the vague notion of the "Spirit" immanent in all men, and regard all religious creeds as the attempts of the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to find expression for its inward experience. Hence no religion, whether <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> or <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, is wholly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; but none can claim to be a message from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> free from any admixture of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. (Cf. Sabatier, "Esquisse", etc., Bk. I, cap. ii.) Here too the autonomy of reason is invoked as fatal to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Revelation properly so called. In the face of these objections, it is evident that the question of the possibility of Revelation is at present one of the most vital portions of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> apologetic. </ul> If the existence of a personal <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be once established, the physical possibility at least of Revelation is undeniable. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has endowed man with means to communicate his thoughts to his fellows, cannot be destitute of the power to communicate His own thoughts to us. [Martineau, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, denies that we possess faculties either to receive or to authenticate a divine revelation concerning the past or the future (Seat of Authority in Religion, p. 311); but such an assertion is arbitrary and extravagant in the extreme.] However, numerous difficulties have been urged on grounds other than that of physical possibility. In estimating their value it seems desirable to distinguish three aspects of Revelation, viz: as it makes known to us; <blockquote> (1) <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, <br>(2) mysteries of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <br>(3) positive <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>, e.g. regarding Divine worship. </blockquote>



<p>(1) The revelation of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> is certainly not inconsistent with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> wisdom. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so created man as to bestow on him endowments amply sufficient for him to attain his last end. Had it been otherwise, the creation would have been imperfect. If over and above this He decreed to make the attainment of beatitude yet easier for man by placing within his reach a far simpler and far more certain way of knowing the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> on the observance of which his fate depended, this is an argument for the Divine generosity; it does not disprove the Divine wisdom. To assume, with certain <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalists</a>, that exceptional intervention can only be explained on the ground that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was unable to embrace His ultimate design in His original scheme is a mere <em>petitio principii</em>. Further, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> supplies an additional reason for such a revelation of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. That <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> teaches us that man by the abuse of his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> has rendered his attainment of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> difficult. Though his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> faculties are not radically vitiated, yet his grasp of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is weakened; his recognition of the moral law is constantly clouded by <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> and questionings. Revelation gives to his mind the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> he had lost, and so far repairs the evils consequent on the catastrophe which had befallen him.

<p>(2) Still more difficulty has been felt regarding mysteries. It is freely asserted that a mystery is something repugnant to reason, and therefore something intrinsically impossible. This objection rests on a mere misunderstanding of what is signified by a mystery. In <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> terminology a conception involves a mystery when it is such that the natural faculties of the mind are unable to see how its elements can coalesce. This does not imply anything contrary to reason. A conception is only contrary to reason when the mind can recognize that its elements are mutually exclusive, and therefore involve a contradiction in terms. A more subtle objection is that urged by Dr. J. Caird, to the effect that every <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that can be partially communicated to the mind by analogies is ultimately capable of being fully grasped by the understanding. "Of all such representations, unless they are purely illusory, it must hold good that implicitly and in undeveloped form they contain rational thought and therefore thought which human intelligence may ultimately free from its sensuous veil. . . . Nothing that is absolutely inscrutable to reason can be made known to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" (Philosophy of Religion, p. 71). The objection rests on a wholly exaggerated view regarding the powers of the human <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. The cognitive faculty of any nature is proportionate to its grade in the scale of being. The intelligence of a finite <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can only penetrate a finite object; it is incapable of comprehending the Infinite. The finite types through which the Infinite is made known to it can never under any circumstances lead to more than analogous <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. It is further frequently urged that the revelation of what the mind cannot understand would be an act of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; and that this faculty can only accept those <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> whose intrinsic reasonableness it recognizes. This assertion, based on the alleged autonomy of reason, can only be met with denial. The function of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is to recognize and admit any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which is adequately presented to it, whether that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be guaranteed by internal or by external criteria. The reason is not deprived of its legitimate activity because the criteria are external. It finds ample scope in weighing the arguments for the credibility of the fact asserted. The existence of mysteries in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> was expressly taught by the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> (De Fide Cath., cap. ii, can. ii). "If anyone shall say that no mysteries properly so called are contained in the Divine revelation, but that all the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be understood and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from natural principles by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> duly cultivated &#151; let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>."

<p>(3) The older (<a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deist</a>) School of <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalists</a> denied the possibility of a Divine revelation imposing any <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> other than those which natural religion enjoins on man. These writers regarded natural religion as, so to speak, a political constitution determining the Divine government of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and held that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could only act as its terms prescribed. This <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> likewise was proscribed at the same time (De Fide Cath., cap. ii, can. ii). "If any one shall say that it is impossible or that it is inexpedient that man should be instructed regarding <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the worship to be paid to Him by Divine revelation &#151; let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>."

<p>It can hardly be questioned that the "autonomy of reasons" furnishes the main source of the difficulties at present felt against Revelation in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sense. It seems desirable to indicate very briefly the various ways in which that principle is understood. It is explained by M. Blondel, an eminent member of the Immanentist School, as signifying that "nothing can enter into a man which does not proceed from him, and which does not correspond in some manner to an interior need of expansion; and that neither in the sphere of historic facts nor of traditional <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, nor of commands imposed by authority, can any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> rank as valid for a man or any precept as <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>, unless it be in some way autonomous and autochthonous" (Lettre sur les exigences, etc., p. 601). Although M. Blondel has in his own case reconciled this principle with the acceptance of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, yet it may readily be seen that it affords an easy ground for the denial not merely of the possibility of external Revelation, but of the whole historic basis of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The origin of this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is to be found in the fact that within the sphere of the natural speculative reason, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which are received purely on external authority, and which are in no way connected with principles already admitted, can scarcely be said to form part of our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Science asks for the inner reason of things and can make no use of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> save in so far as it can reach the principles from which they flow. The extension of this to religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> is an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> directly traceable to the assumption of the eighteenth-century <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> that there are no religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> save those which the human <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can attain unaided. The principle is, however, sometimes applied with a less extensive signification. It may be understood to involve no more than that reason cannot be compelled to admit any religious <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> or any moral <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> merely because they possess extrinsic guarantees of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; they must in every case be able to justify their validity on intrinsic grounds. Thus Prof. J. Caird writes: "Neither moral nor religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> can be simply transferred to the human spirit in the form of fact, nor can they be verified by any evidence outside of or lower than themselves" (Fundamental Ideas of Christianity, p. 31). A somewhat different meaning again is implied in the canon of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> in which the right of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to claim absolute independence (autonomy) is denied. "If anyone shall say that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is independent in such wise that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot be commanded it by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> &#151; let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>" (De Fide Cath., cap. iii, can. i). This canon is directed against the position maintained as already noted by the older <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalists</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deists</a>, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is amply sufficient without exterior assistance to attain to absolute <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in all matters of religion (cf. Vacant, "Etudes Th&eacute;ologiques", I, 572; II, 387).
<h2 id="section3">Necessity of revelation</h2>

<p>Can it be said that Revelation is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to man? There can be no question as to its necessity, if it be admitted that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> destines man to attain a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> beatitude which surpasses the exigencies of his natural endowments. In that case <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must needs reveal alike the existence of that <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end and the means by which we are to attain it. But is Revelation <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> even in order that man should observe the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>? If our race be viewed in its present condition as history displays it, the answer can only be that it is, morally speaking, impossible for men unassisted by Revelation, to attain by their natural powers such a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that law as is sufficient to the right ordering of life. In other words, Revelation is morally <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Absolute necessity we do not assert. Man, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> teaches, possesses the requisite faculties to discover the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> indeed asserted that man's <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> had become hopelessly obscured by <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, so that even natural <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was beyond his reach. And the <a href="../cathen/15013a.htm">Traditionalists</a> of the nineteenth century (<a href="../cathen/02353a.htm">Bautain</a>, <a href="../cathen/02677a.htm">Bonnetty</a>, etc.) also fell into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, teaching that man was incapable of arriving at moral and religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> apart from Revelation. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, on the contrary, recognizes the capacity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and grants that here and there <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> may have existed, who had freed themselves from prevalent <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, and who had attained to such a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> as would suffice to guide them to the attainment of beatitude. But she teaches nevertheless that this can only be the case as regards a few, and that for the bulk of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> Revelation is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. That this is so may be shown both from the facts of history and from the nature of the case. As regards the testimony of history, it is <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> that even the most civilized of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> races have fallen into the grossest <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> regarding the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>; and from these it may safely be asserted they would never have emerged. Certainly the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> would not have enabled them to do so; for many of these denied even such fundamental principles of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> as the <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the freedom of the will. Again, by the very nature of the case, the difficulties involved in the attainment of the requisite <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are insuperable. For men to be able to attain such a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> as will enable them to order their lives rightly, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of that law must be so plain that the mass of men can discover them without long delay, and possess a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of them which will be alike free from uncertainty and secure from serious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. No reasonable man will maintain that in the case of the greater part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> this is possible. Even the most vital <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> are called in question and are met by serious objections. The separation of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is a work involving time and labour. For this the majority of men have neither inclination nor opportunity. Apart from the security which Revelation gives they would reject an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> both irksome and uncertain. It results that a revelation even of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> is for man in his present state a moral necessity.
<h2 id="section4">Criteria of revelation</h2>

<p>The fact that Revelation is not merely possible but morally <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> is in itself a strong argument for the existence of a revelation, and imposes on all men the strict <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of examining the credentials of a religion which presents itself with <em>prima facie</em> marks of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. On the other hand if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has conferred a revelation on men, it stands to reason that He must have attached to it plain and evident criteria enabling even the unlettered to recognize His message for what it is, and to distinguish it from all <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> claimants.

<p>The criteria of Revelation are either external or internal: (1) External criteria consist in certain signs attached to the revelation as a divine testimony to its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, e.g., <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. (2) Internal criteria are those which are found in the nature of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> itself in the manner in which it was presented to the world, and in the effects which it produces on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. These are distinguished into negative and positive criteria. (a) The immunity of the alleged revelation from any teaching, speculative or moral, which is manifestly <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> or self-contradictory, the absence of all <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> on the part of those who deliver it to the world, provide negative internal criteria. (b) Positive internal criteria are of various kinds. One such is found in the beneficent effects of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and in its power to meet even the highest aspirations which man can frame. Another consists in the internal conviction felt by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> (Suarez, "De Fide", IV, sect. 5, n. 9.) In the last century there was in certain <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of thought a manifest tendency to deny the value of all external criteria. This was largely due to the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalist</a> polemic against <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Not a few non-Catholic divines anxious to make terms with the enemy adopted this attitude. They allowed that <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are useless as a foundation for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and that they form on the contrary one of the chief difficulties which lie in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith's</a> path. Faith, they admitted, must be presupposed before the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> can be accepted. Hence these writers held the sole criterion of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to lie in inward experience &#151; in the testimony of the Spirit. Thus Schleiermacher says: "We renounce altogether any attempt to demonstrate the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and the necessity of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. On the contrary we assume that every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> before he commences inquiries of this kind is already convinced that no other form of religion but the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> can harmonize with his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>" (Glaubenslehre, n. 11). The <a href="../cathen/15013a.htm">Traditionalists</a> by denying the power of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> to test the grounds of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> were driven to fall back on the same criterion (cf. Lamennais, "Pens&eacute;es Diverses", p. 488).

<p>This position is altogether untenable. The testimony afforded by inward experience is undoubtedly not to be neglected. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> have always recognized its value. But its force is limited to the individual who is the subject of it. It cannot be employed as a criterion valid for all; for its absence is no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Moreover, of all the criteria it is the one with regard to which there is most possibility of deception. When <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> mingled with <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is presented to the mind, it often happens that the whole teaching, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> alike, is believed to have a Divine guarantee, because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has recognized and welcomed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of some one <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, e.g., the Atonement. Taken alone and apart from objective <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> it conveys but a probability that the revelation is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> expressly condemns the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of those who teach it to be the only criterion (De Fide Cath., cap. iii, can. iii).

<p>The perfect agreement of a religious <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> with the teachings of reason and <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, its power to satisfy, and more than satisfy, the highest aspirations of man, its beneficent influence both as regards public and private life, provide us with a more trustworthy test. This is a criterion which has often been applied with great force on behalf of the claims of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to be the sole guardian of God's Revelation. These qualities indeed appertain in so transcendent a degree to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that the argument must needs carry conviction to an earnest and truth-seeking mind. Another criterion which at first sight bears some resemblance to this claims a mention here. It is based upon the theory of Immanence and has of recent years been strenuously advocated by certain of the less extreme members of the <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernist School</a>. These writers urge that the vital needs of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> imperatively demand, as their <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> complement, Divine co-operation, <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> grace, and even the supreme magisterium of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. To these needs the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion alone corresponds. And this correspondence with our vital needs is, they hold, the one sure criterion of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The theory is altogether inconsistent with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. It supposes that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Revelation and the gift of grace are not free gifts from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but something of which the nature of man is absolutely exigent; and without which it would be incomplete. It is a return to the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a>. (Denz. 1021, etc.)

<p>While the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as we have said, is far from undervaluing internal criteria, she has always regarded external criteria as the most easily recognizable and the most decisive. Hence the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> teaches: "In order that the obedience of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> might be agreeable to reason, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has willed that to the internal aids of the Holy Spirit, there should be joined external <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of His Revelation, viz: Divine works (<em>facta divina</em>), especially <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and prophecy, which inasmuch as they manifestly display the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a> and the omniscience of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are most certain signs of a Divine revelation and are suited to the understanding of all" (De Fide Cath., cap. iii). As an instance of a work evidently Divine and yet other than <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> or prophecy, the council instances the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which, "by reason of the marvellous manner of its propagation, its surprising <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, its inexhaustible fruitfulness in all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, its catholic unity and its invincible stability, is a mighty and perpetual motive of credibility and an irrefragable testimony to its own divine legation" (l. c.). The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the teaching of the council regarding external criteria is plain to any unprejudiced mind. Granted the presence of the negative criteria, external guarantees establish the Divine origin of a revelation as nothing else can do. They are, so to say, a seal affixed by the hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, and authenticating the work as His. (For a fuller treatment of their apologetic value, and for a discussion of objections, see <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">MIRACLES</a>; <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">APOLOGETICS</a>.)
<h2 id="section5">The Christian revelation</h2>

<p>It remains here to distinguish the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Revelation or "deposit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" from what are termed <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">private revelations</a>. This distinction is of importance: for while the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> recognizes that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has spoken to His servants in every age, and still continues thus to favour chosen <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, she is careful to distinguish these revelations from the Revelation which has been committed to her charge, and which she proposes to all her members for their acceptance. That Revelation was given in its entirety to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. After the death of the last of the twelve it could receive no increment. It was, as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> calls it, a deposit &#151; "the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> once delivered to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>" (Jude, 2) &#151; for which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was to "contend" but to which she could add nothing. Thus, whenever there has been question of defining a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, whether at Nic&aelig;a, at <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>, or at the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican</a>, the sole point of debate has been as to whether the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is found in Scripture or in <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Apostolic tradition</a>. The gift of Divine assistance (see I), sometimes confounded with Revelation by the less instructed of anti-Catholic writers, merely preserves the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">supreme pontiff</a> from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in defining the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; it does not enable him to add jot or tittle to it. All subsequent revelations conferred by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are known as <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">private revelations</a>, for the reason that they are not directed to the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> but are for the good of individual members alone, They may indeed be a legitimate object for our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; but that will depend on the evidence in each particular case. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not propose them to us as part of her message. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that in certain cases she has given her <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> to certain <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">private revelations</a>. This, however, only signifies: <ul> <li>that there is nothing in them contrary to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> or to the moral law, and, <li>that there are sufficient indications of their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to justify the faithful in attaching credence to them without being guilty of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> or of imprudence. </ul> It may however be further asked, whether the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Revelation does not receive increment through the development of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. During the last half of the nineteenth century the question of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> development was widely debated. Owing to <a href="../cathen/07085a.htm">Guenther's</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> teaching that the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> assume a new sense as human <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> progresses, the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> declared once for all that the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">Church's dogmas</a> is immutable (De Fide Cath., cap. iv, can. iii). On the other hand it explicitly recognizes that there is a legitimate mode of development, and cites to that effect (op. cit., cap. iv) the words of <a href="../cathen/15439b.htm">Vincent of L&eacute;rins</a>: "Let understanding <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and wisdom [regarding the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Church's doctrine</a>] progress and make large increase in each and in all, in the individual and in the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as ages and centuries advance: but let it be solely in its own order, retaining, that is, the same <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, the same sense, the same import" (Commonit. 28). Two of the most eminent <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> writers of the period, <a href="../cathen/06242a.htm">Cardinal Franzelin</a> and <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman</a>, have on very different lines dealt with the progress and nature of this development. <a href="../cathen/06242a.htm">Cardinal Franzelin</a> in his "De Divina Traditione et Scriptura" (pt. XXII VI) has principally in view the <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegelian</a> theories of <a href="../cathen/07085a.htm">Guenther</a>. He consequently lays the chief stress on the identity at all points of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> datum, and explains development almost exclusively as a process of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> deduction. <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman</a> wrote his "Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine" in the course of the two years (1843 45) immediately preceding his reception into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He was called on to deal with different adversaries, viz., the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> who justified their separation from the main body of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> on the ground that <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> had corrupted primitive teaching by a series of additions. In that work he examines in detail the difference between a corruption and a development. He shows how a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and fertile <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is endowed with a vital and assimilative energy of its own, in virtue of which, without undergoing the least substantive change, it attains to an ever completer expression, as the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> brings it into contact with new aspects of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or forces it into collision with new <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>: the life of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is shown to be analogous to an organic development. He provides a series of tests distinguishing a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> development from a corruption, chief among them being the preservation of type, and the continuity of principles; and then, applying the tests to the case of the additions of Roman teaching, shows that these have the marks not of corruptions but of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and legitimate developments. The theory, though less scholastic in its form than that of <a href="../cathen/06242a.htm">Franzelin</a>, is in perfect conformity with <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> no less than his <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> contemporary teaches that the whole <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, alike in its later as in its earlier forms, was contained in the original revelation given to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, and that its identity is guaranteed to us by the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> magisterium of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The claim of certain <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernist</a> writers that their views on the evolution of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> were connected with <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> theory of development is the merest figment.
