<h1>Rhinocolura</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a> in Augustamnica Prima, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/11610d.htm">Pelusium</a>. Rhinocolura or Rhinocorura was a maritime town so situated on the boundary of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and Palestine that ancient geographers attributed it sometimes to one country and sometimes to the other. Its history is unknown. Diodorus Siculus (I, 60, 5) relates that it must have been founded by Actisanes, King of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, who established there convicts whose noses had been cut off; this novel legend was invented to give a Greek meaning to the name of the town. Strabo (XVI, 781) says that it was formerly the great emporium of the merchandise of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> and Arabia, which was unloaded at <a href="../cathen/09204b.htm">Leuce</a> Come, on the eastern shore of the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, whence it was transported via Petra to Rhinocolura, It is identified usually with the present fortified village El Anish, which has 400 inhabitants, excluding the garrison, situated half a mile from the sea, and has some ruins of the Roman period. It was taken by the French in 1799, who signed there in 1800 the treaty by which they evacuated <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Today it and its vicinity are occupied by <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, after having been for a long period claimed by Turkey. The village is near a stream which bears its name (Wadi el-Arish), and receives its waters from central Sinai; it does not flow in winter, but is torrential after heavy rain. It is the "nahal Misraim", or stream of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, frequently mentioned in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> (<a href="../bible/gen015.htm#vrs18">Genesis 15:18</a>, etc.), as marking on the south-west the frontier of the Promised Land. Instead of the ordinary translation of the Hebrew name, the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> in <a href="../bible/isa027.htm#vrs12">Isaiah 27:12</a>, render it by <em>Hrinokoroura</em>; see <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (In Isaiam, XXVII, 12 in P.L., XXIV, 313).

<p><a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> (Oriens Christianus, II, 541) gives a list of thirteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Rhinocolura: the first does not belong to it. A <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> also wrongly names a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> said to have assisted in 325 at the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nice</a>. The first authentic titular known is St. Melas, who suffered exile under <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> and is mentioned on 16 January in the Roman Martyrology. He was succeeded by his brother Solon. Polybius was the disciple of <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, whose life he wrote. Hermogenes assisted at the Council of Ephesus (431), was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by St. Cyril, and received many letters from his suffragan St. Isidore. His successor Zeno defended <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a> at the Second Council of Ephesus (451). Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were: Alphius, the Massalian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>; Ptolemy, about 460, Gregory, 610. Of the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> on the list one did not belong to Rhinocolura; the other three are <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.
