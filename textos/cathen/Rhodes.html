<h1>Rhodes</h1>  

<p>(RHODUS)

<p>A titular <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of the Cyclades. It is an island opposite to Lycia and Caria, from which it is separated by a narrow arm of the sea. It has an area of about 564 sq. miles, is well watered by many streams and the river Candura, and is very rich in fruits of all kinds. The climate is so genial that the sun shines ever there, as recorded in a proverb already known to Pliny (Hist. natur., II, 62). The island, inhabited first by the Carians and then by the <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicians</a> (about 1300 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>) who settled several colonies there, was occupied about 800 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> by the Dorian Greeks. In 408 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> the inhabitants of the three chief towns, Lindus, Ialysus, and Camirus founded the city of Rhodes, from which the island took its name. This town, built on the side of a hill, had a very fine port. On the breakwater, which separated the interior from the exterior port, was the famous bronze <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, the Colossus of Rhodes, 105 feet high, which cost 300 talents. Constructed (280) from the machines of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which Demetrius Poliorcetes had to abandon after his defeat before the town, it was thrown down by an earthquake in 203 <font size=-2>B.C.;</font> its ruins were sold in the seventh century by Caliph Moaviah to a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> from Emesus, who loaded them on 900 camels. After the death of Alexander the Great and the expulsion of the Macedonian garrison (323 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>) the island, owing to its navy manned by the best mariners in the world, became the rival of Carthage and <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. Allied with the Romans, and more or less under their protectorate, Rhodes became a centre of art and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>; its <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of rhetoric was frequented by many Romans, including Cato, Cicero, C&aelig;sar, and Pompey. Ravaged by Cassius in 43 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> it remained nominally independent till <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 44, when it was incorporated with the Roman Empire by Claudius, becoming under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> the capital of the Isles or of the Cyclades, which it long remained.

<p>The First Book of Machabees (xv, 23) records that <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> sent the Rhodians a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> in favour of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> stopped there on his way from <a href="../cathen/10303c.htm">Miletus</a> to Jerusalem (<a href="../bible/act021.htm#vrs1">Acts 21:1</a>); he may even have made converts there. In three other passages of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> (<a href="../bible/gen010.htm#vrs4">Genesis 10:4</a>; <a href="../bible/1ch001.htm#vrs7">1 Chronicles 1:7</a>; <a href="../bible/eze027.htm#vrs15">Ezekiel 27:15</a>) the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> renders by Rhodians what the Hebrew and the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> rightly call Dodanim and Dedan. If we except some <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">ancient inscriptions</a> supposed to be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, there is no trace of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> until the third century, when Bishop Euphranon is said to have opposed the <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratites</a>. Euphrosynus assisted at the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> (325). As the religious <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of the Cyclades, Rhodes had eleven suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> towards the middle of the seventh century (Gelzer, "Ungedruckte. . . . Texte der Notiti&aelig; episcopatuum", 542); at the beginning of the tenth century, it had only ten (op. cit., 558); at the close of the fifteenth, only one, Lerne (op. cit., 635), which has since disappeared. Rhodes is still a Greek <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> depending on the Patriarchate of Constantinople. On 15 August, 1310, under the leadership of Grand Master Foulques de Villaret, the Knights of St. John captured the island in spite of the Greek emperor, Andronicus II, and for more than two centuries, thanks to their fleet, were a solid bulwark between <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>. In 1480 Rhodes, under the orders of Pierre d'Aubusson, underwent a memorable siege by the lieutenants of Mahomet II; on 24 October, 1522, Villiers de l'Isle Adam had to make an honorable capitulation to Solyman II and deliver the island definitively to the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. From 1328 to 1546 Rhodes was a Latin <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, having for suffragans the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of <a href="../cathen/10169b.htm">Melos</a>, Nicaria, Carpathos, <a href="../cathen/03689b.htm">Chios</a>, Tinos, and Mycone; the list of its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is to be found in <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> (Oriens christ., III, 1049) and Eubel (Hierarchia catholica medii &aelig;vi, I, 205; II, 148; III, 188). The most distinguished <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Andreas Colossensis (the archdiocese was called Rhodes or Colossi) who, in 1416 at <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a> and 1439 at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, defended the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> against the Greeks, and especially against Marcus Eugenicus. After the death of Marco Cattaneo, the last residential <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Rhodes became a mere titular <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, while Naxos inherited its <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. On 3 March, 1797 it became again a titular <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> but the title was thenceforth attached to the See of Malta. Its suffragans are Carpathos, <a href="../cathen/09189a.htm">Leros</a>, <a href="../cathen/10169b.htm">Melos</a>, <a href="../cathen/13421c.htm">Samos</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14506b.htm">Tenedos</a>. By a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of the Propaganda</a>, 14 August, 1897, a <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefecture Apostolic</a>, entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, was established in the Island of Rhodes; it has in addition <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over a score of neighbouring islands, of which the principal are Carpathos, <a href="../cathen/09189a.htm">Leros</a>, and Calymnos. There are in all 320 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> while the island, the capital of the vilayet of the archipelago, contains 30,000 inhabitants. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> have three priests; the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a> have established there a scholasticate for the Orient as well as a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters of Gemona have a girls' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The most striking feature of the city, in addition to a series of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> towers and fortifications, is the Street of the Knights, which still preserves their blason (Order of St. John) and the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the erection of each house or palace; several of the mosques are former churches.
