<h1>Richard Angelus a S. Francisco Mason</h1>  

<p>English &mdash; or <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> &mdash; <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> writer; b. in Wiltshire, 1599; d. at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, 30 Dec, 1678. There is some dispute as to the nationality of his extraction: while it is agreed that he was a native of the English county of Wiltshire, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> record, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1721, mentions his having been "for some time dean of a Catholick deanery in Ireland", conveying a suggestion that his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> may have been <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>: Gillow (Bibl. Dict. of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>) thinks that if Mason ever held a deanery in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, it must have been under the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Establishment, in which case Father Angelus, as he was known among his contemporaries, would have to be reckoned among the seventeenth-century converts. The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> mention his "Catholick deanery", however, was written forty-three years after Mason's death, and there is evidence that he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> four years after his profession in the Seraphic Order, the latter event having taken place in 1629. In any case he rapidly became eminent in the order, being created a doctor of divinity and appointed successively to the high administrative offices of definitor, guardian, and visitor of the province of Brabant. Elected provincial in 1659, he visited <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain permission for the settlement there of a colony of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> sisters from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Nieuport (Flanders) to which he had heen confessor. From 1662 to 1675 he lived in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, as domestic <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to <a href="../cathen/01765c.htm">Lord Arundell of Wardour</a>, after which period he retired to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> to <a href="../cathen/04660c.htm">prepare for death</a>.

<p>Father Angelus displayed, in the course of his long and otherwise busy, <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, a remarkable industry in both original composition and the compilation of devotional manuals. The latter include his "Manuale Tertii Ordinis S. Francisci" with a commentary on the Rule, and meditations (Douai, 1643), "The Rule of Penance of the Seraphical Father St. Francis" (Douai, 1644); "Sacrarium privilegiorum quorundam Seraphico P. S. Francisco . . indultorum" (Douai, 1636). Among his historical writings are "Certamen Seraphicum Provinciae Angliae pro Sancta Dei Ecclesia" (Douai, 1649), a review of distinguished English <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and polemical writers, and "Apologia pro Scoto Anglo" (Douai, 1656). &mdash; The last named work has for its main scope the establishment, against <a href="../cathen/04099c.htm">Colgan</a>, for the thesis that the great <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a>, was not an Irishman, but an Englishman: it may be fairly inferred that its author, if he himself was of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> descent, was not fully conscious of the fact. &mdash; His "Liturgical Discourse of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass" (s. 1, 1670, dedicated to <a href="../cathen/01765c.htm">Henry, Lord Arundell of Wardour</a>, "Master of the Horse to our late Queen Mother Henrietta Maria"), was abridged in the "Holy Altar and Sacrifice Explained" which Father Pacificus Baker, O.S.F., published at the request of <a href="../cathen/14432a.htm">Bishop James Talbot</a> (London, 1768).
