<h1>Richard Creagh</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a> early in the sixteenth century; d. in the Tower of London, in 1585. The son of a merchant, he followed the same calling in his youth and made many voyages to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. A providential escape from shipwreck led him to embrace a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, and after some years of study abroad he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Returning to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, he taught <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for a time at <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>. He refused nominations for the Sees of <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a> and Cashel, but the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">Papal nuncio</a>, David Wolfe, determined to conquer his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, named him for the primacy when it became <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a>, and would accept no refusal. Creagh was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and in 1564 returned to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>. Shane O'Neill was then the most potent of the Ulster chiefs. From the first he and Creagh disagreed. O'Neill <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; Creagh preached loyalty to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Armagh, even in his presence. O'Neill retorted by burning down the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Creagh then cursed him and refused to absolve him because he had put a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to death. Shane retaliated by threatening the life of the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>, and by declaring publicly that there was no one on earth he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> so much, except the Queen of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, whom he confessed he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> more. In spite of all this, Creagh was arrested and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by the English. Twice he escaped, but he was retaken and in 1567 lodged in the Tower of London, and kept there till his death. From his repeated examinations before the English Privy Council his enmity to Shane O'Neill and his unwavering loyalty to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> were made plain. But his steadfastness in the Faith and his great popularity in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> were considered crimes, and in consequence the Council refused to set him free. Not content with this his moral character was assailed. The daughter of his jailer was urged to charge him with having assaulted her. The charge was investigated in public court, where the girl retracted, declaring her accusation absolutely <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. It has been said that Creagh was poisoned in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and this, whether <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, was believed at the time of his death. His grand-nephew, Peter Creagh, was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a> about 1676. He was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for two years in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> accusations of Titus Oates, but acquitted (1682), was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Archdiocese of Tuam</a> in 1686. He followed James II to the Continent, was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> in 1693, but was never able to return and take possession. He became Coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, where he died (July, 1705).
