<h1>Richard Fitzralph</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, b. at Dundalk, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, about 1295; d. at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, 16 Dec., 1360. He studied in <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, where we first find mention of him in 1325 as an ex-fellow and teacher of Balliol College. He was made doctor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> before 1331, and was chancellor of <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">Oxford University</a> in 1333. In 1334 he was made chancellor of Lincoln Cathedral, and in Jan., 1335, canon and <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebendary</a> of <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a>, "notwithstanding that he has <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonries</a> and <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a> of Crediton and Bosham, and has had provision made for him of the Chancellorship of Lincoln and the <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonries</a> and <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a> of Armagh and Exeter, all of which he is to resign" (Bliss, Calendar of Entries in Papal Registers, II, 524). He was <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a> when made dean of <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a> in 1337. On 31 July, 1346, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>.

<p>Fitzralph was a man who pre-eminently joined the speculative temperament with the practical. One of the great <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> luminaries of his day, and a close friend of the scholarly <a href="../cathen/13042b.htm">Richard of Bury</a>, he fostered learning among his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> by sending many of them to take higher studies in <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> too in visiting the various church provinces, and in bettering financial as well as spiritual conditions in his own see. He contended for his <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> against the immunity claimed by the See of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>; and on various occasions acted as peacemaker between the English and the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>. He was in great demand as a preacher, and many of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> are still extant in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>. Whilst at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> in 1350, Fitzralph presented a memorial from the English <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> reciting certain complaints against the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a>. After serving on a commission appointed by <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> to inquire into the points at issue, he embodied his own views in the treatise "De Pauperie Salvatoris", which deals with the subject of evangelical poverty, as well as the questions then agitated concerning dominion, possession, and use, and the relation of these to the state of grace in man. Part of this work is printed by Poole in his edition of <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif's</a> "De Dominio Divino" (London, 1890). It was probably during this visit that Fitzralph also took part in the negotiations going on between the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> delegates and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He composed an elaborate apologetico-polemic work, entitled "Summa in Quaestionibus Armenorum" (Paris, 1511), in which he displayed his profound <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Scripture with telling effect in refuting the Greek and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>.

<p>Fitzralph's controversy with the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> came to a crisis when he was cited to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> in 1357. Avowing his entire submission to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, he defended his attitude towards the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> in the plea entitled "Defensorium Curatorum" (printed in Goldast's "Monarchia" and elsewhere). He maintained as probable that <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> mendicancy is contrary to the teachings of Christ. His main plea, however, was for the withdrawal of the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> in regard to confessions, preaching, burying, etc. He urged a return to the purity of their original institution, claiming that these privileges undermined the authority of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> were not molested, but by gradual legislation harmony was restored between them and the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Fitzralph's position, however, was not directly condemned, and he died in peace at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. In 1370 his remains were transferred to St. Nicholas' church, Dundalk; <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were reported from his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> and for several centuries his memory was held in saintly veneration. His printed works are mentioned above. His "Opus in P. Lombardi Sententias" and several other works (list in the "Catholic University Bulletin", XI, 243) are still in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>.
