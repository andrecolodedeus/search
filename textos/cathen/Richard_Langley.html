<h1>Richard Langley</h1>  

<p>Layman and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, b. probably at Grimthorpe, Yorks, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> unknown; d. at <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, 1 Dec., 1586. From his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, Richard Langley, of Rathorpe Hall, Walton, he probably inherited Rathorpe, but for the greater part of his life continued to reside on his estate at Ousethorpe, in the East Riding. His mother was Joan Beaumont of Mirfield. He married Agnes, daughter of Richard Hansby, New Malton, by whom he had one son, Christopher (b. 1565), and four daughters. (See "Visitation of Yorkshire", ed. Foster, London, 1875.) During the troublous times of the Elizabethan period Langley gave over his energies and a very considerable part of his fortune to assisting the oppressed <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; his house was freely offered as an asylum to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. He even constructed a subterranean retreat, perhaps beneath the Grimthorpe dwelling, which afforded them sanctuary. This refuge was betrayed to the President of the North, and on 28 Oct., 1586, a strong band of military was despatched, several justices and <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the new religion joining in the quest, to make a domiciliary visitation of the Grimthorpe and Ousethorpe houses. Two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were found in hiding at the former; at the latter Langley himself was seized. All three were carried to <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, committed to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and subsequently arraigned before the President of the North, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> because of their office and Langley for harboring them.

<p>During the investigation Langley was steadfast in his adherence to the Faith. He would not take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of the queen's <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> supremacy, nor compromise his religious heritage by seeking to ingratiate himself with the lord president or Privy Council. It was feared that the jury which had first been empaneled to decide upon the case might return a verdict in accordance with the dictates of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, it was therefore discharged and replaced by another of tried fidelity to the prosecutors. Langley was condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>, without any evidence being adduced to establish the fact that he had knowingly sheltered <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and was hanged, drawn, and quartered at York. His remains were refused honorable burial, despite the importunity of his friends.
