<h1>Richard Russell</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Viz&eacute;u in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, b. in Berkshire, 1630; d. at Viz&eacute;u, 15 Nov., 1693. He was of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> station, and when twelve years old became servant to Dr. Edward Daniel, newly appointed President of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> College. Five years later, having meanwhile applied his leisure to study, he was admitted an alumnus of the college and took the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, 14 Aug, 1647. In 1653 he went to <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai College</a>, and thence to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>. In 1655 he returned to <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> as <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>, but two years later was summoned by the Chapter to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where he spent three years as a <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> ambassador. On his return to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> he received the title of Secretary to the Queen, and a pension, in consideration of his services to the crown of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. Shortly afterwards he was again in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> on business connected with the marriage treaty of Charles II and Catharine of Braganza, and on this occasion he was elected a Canon of the English Chapter (26 June, 1661). Having declined the Bishopric of the Cape Verde Islands, Russell accompanied the Infanta to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The English Chapter hoped that he might be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of a Portuguese see and that then he would return to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, resign his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and become head of the English <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> with episcopal powers; for the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had long been without a resident <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and they had had no episcopal superior at all since the death of Bishop Smith in 1655. This plan, however, came to nothing, and when Russell was persuaded to accept the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of <a href="../cathen/12283c.htm">Portalegre</a> in 1671 he decided to remain in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the English College, <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, on 27 Sept., 1671. Overcoming the first opposition of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to a foreign <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he spent ten years in <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and apostolic labor and effected a complete reformation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In 1682 he was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Viz&eacute;u where he spent the last eleven years of his life. His portrait is preserved at the English College, <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>.
