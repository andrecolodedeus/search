<h1>Richard Smith</h1>  

<p>Born in Worcestershire, 1500; died at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, 9 July, 1563. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Merton College, Oxford; and, having taken his M.A. degree in 1530, he became registrar of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in 1532. In 1536 <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> appointed him first Regius Professor of divinity, and he took his doctorate in that subject on 10 July in the same year. He subsequently became master of Whittington College, London; <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Dunstan's-in-the-East; <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of Cuxham, Oxfordshire; principal of <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban's</a> Hall; and divinity reader at Magdalen College. Under Edward VI he is said by his opponents to have <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> authority at St. Paul's Cross (15 May, 1547) and at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, but the accounts of the proceedings are obscure and unreliable. If he yielded at all, he soon recovered and accordingly suffered the loss of his professorship, being succeeded by <a href="../cathen/11773d.htm">Peter Martyr</a>, with whom he held a public disputation in 1549. Shortly afterwards he was arrested, but was soon liberated. Going to <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, he became professor of divinity there. During Mary's <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> restoration he regained most of his preferments, and was made royal <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> and canon of Christ Church. He took a prominent part in the proceedings against Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer. He again lost all his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> at the change of religion under Elizabeth, and after a short <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> in Parker's house he escaped to <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, where he was appointed by Philip II <a href="../cathen/04659a.htm">dean</a> of St. Peter's church. There is no foundation for the <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderous</a> story spread by the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> to account for his deprivation of his Oxford professorship. When <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai University</a> was founded on 5 Oct., 1562, he was installed as chancellor and professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, but only lived a few months to fill these offices. He wrote many works, the chief of which are: "Assertion and Defence of the Sacrament of the Altar" (1546); "Defence of the Sacrifice of the Mass" (1547); "Defensio c&aelig;libatus sacerdotum" (1550); "Diatriba de hominis justificatione" (1550); "Buckler of the Catholic Faith" (1555-56); "De Miss&aelig; Sacrificio" (1562); and several refutations of <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, Jewell, and Beza, all published in 1562.
