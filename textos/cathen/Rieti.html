<h1>Rieti</h1>  

<p>(REATINA).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The city is situated in the valley of the River Velino, which, on account of the calcareous deposits that accumulate in it, grows shallower and imperils the city, so that even in ancient days it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to construct canals and outlets, like that of Marius Curius Dentatus (272 B.C.) which, repaired and enlarged by <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, has produced the magnificent waterfall of the Velino, near <a href="../cathen/10704a.htm">Terni</a>. The city, which was founded by the Pelasgians, was the chief town of the Sabines, and became later a Roman <em>municipium</em> and prefecture. After the Longobard invasion it was the seat of a "gastaldo", dependent on the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>. It was presented to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> by <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a> in 962; in 1143, after a long siege, it was destroyed by King Roger of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. It was besieged again in 1210 by Otto of Brunswick when forcing his way into the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>. In the thirteenth century the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> took refuge there on several occasions, and in 1288 it witnessed the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of Charles II of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>; later an <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a> resided at Rieti. In 1860, by the disloyalty of a delegate, it was occupied by the Italian troops without resistance. Rieti was the birthplace of Blessed Colomba (1501); in the sixth century it contained an Abbey of St. Stephen; the body of St. Baldovino, <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a>, founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Sts. Matthew and Pastor (twelfth century) is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Near Rieti is Greccio, where St. Francis set up the first <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">Christmas crib</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is in Lombard style, with a <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the fourth or fifth century. It should be remarked that in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> documents there is frequent confusion between <em>Reatinus</em> (Rieti), <em>Aretinus</em> (Arezzo), and <em>Teatinus</em> (Chieti). The first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rieti is Ursus (499); <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> mentions Probus and Albinus (sixth century). The names of many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the Longobard period are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Later we meet with Dodonus (1137), who repaired the damage done by King Roger; Benedict, who in 1184 officiated at the marriage of Queen Constance of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and Henry VI; Rainaldo, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> (1249), restorer of discipline, which work was continued by Tommaso (1252); Pietro Guerra (1278), who had <a href="../cathen/01470a.htm">Andrea Pisano</a> erect the episcopal palace with materials taken from the ancient amphitheatre of <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a>; Lodovico Teodonari (1380), <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> while engaged in Divine service, on account of his severity, which deed was cruelly punished by <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a>; Angelo Capranica (1450), later a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; Cardinal Pompeo Colonna (1508), who for rebellion against <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> and <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> was twice deprived of his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalitial</a> dignity; Scipione Colonna (1520), his nephew, took part in the revolt against <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> in 1528, and was killed in an encounter with Amico of <a href="../cathen/01774a.htm">Ascoli</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/05785d.htm">Farfa</a>; Marianus Victorius (1572, for a few days), a distinguished writer and petrologist; Giorgio Bolognetti (1639), restored the episcopal palace and was distinguished for his charity; Gabrielle Ferretti (1827), later a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, a man of great charity. At present the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> contains 60 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 142,100 inhabitants, 250 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 7 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> with 63 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 15 houses of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>; 2 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational establishments</a> for boys, and 4 for girls.
