<h1>Right of Exclusion</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>Jus Exclusiv&aelig;</em>.

<p>The alleged competence of the more important <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, to indicate to their respective <a href="../cathen/03341a.htm">cardinal protector</a>, or cardinal <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>, those members of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> who were <em>person&aelig; minus grat&aelig;,</em> so that, if there was a possibility of one of these becoming <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the authorized <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> might, before the decisive ballot, give his veto, in the name of his government, against such election.

<p>At one time this veto was given orally; later it was given in writing. The <a href="../cathen/03341a.htm">cardinal protector</a>, or cardinal <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>, who cast the veto, was, as a rule, that member of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> who had been created a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> at the desire of his government. This declaration could only be made at the last moment, for the reason that, by traditional usage, a government might invoke this alleged right only once at the same <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a>, and consequently would not wish to employ it unnecessarily. A veto made after the election was not recognized.

<p>Opinions differ widely as to the antiquity of this right. It cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that it is in any way related to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in the papal election, exercised by German kings and emperors in the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Indeed, it was not until the sixteenth century, that the more important <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> countries obtained larger influence over papal elections, owing to the contentions of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and the German emperor, for the control of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. These governments were originally satisfied with the so-called "ballot of exclusion", i.e., they sought to unite more than one-third of the voters against an undesirable candidate and thus make his election impossible, through lack of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> two-thirds majority. About the beginning of the seventeenth century, however, in the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclaves</a> that elected <a href="../cathen/09166a.htm">Leo XI</a> and <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> (1605), <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> raised the claim, that it could exclude a candidate by a general declaration addressed to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a>. Soon after, in the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclaves</a> of 1644 and 1655, which elected, respectively, <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> and <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>, and in both of which Cardinal Sacchetti was excluded as a candidate, the term used for this action was <em>Jus Exclusiv&aelig;</em> (right of exclusion). This right was, therefore, claimed about the middle of the seventeenth century; later dates suggested, e.g., 1691, or 1721, must be abandoned. It was also about the middle of the seventeenth century that treatises and polemic writings began to appear, in which the alleged right of exclusion was discussed; among such controversialists were the Cardinals Albizzi and <a href="../cathen/09417b.htm">Lugo</a>.

<p>In the following period repeated use was made of this so-called right. In 1721 the German emperor formally excluded Cardinal Paolucci; in 1730 the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> excluded Cardinal Imperiali; in 1758 <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> exercised this right to exclude Cardinal Cavalchini. In the nineteenth century <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> maintained the right of exclusion, in 1830, against Cardinal Severoli, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, in 1830, against Cardinal Giustiniani; in 1903 <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> again exercised this right, this time against Cardinal Rampolla.

<p>As a matter of fact, no government has a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to exercise any veto in a papal election. On the contrary the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> have expressly repudiated the exercise of such right. <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "In eligendis", of 9 October, 1562 (Magnum Bullarium, II, 97 sqq.), ordered the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to elect a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> "Principum s&aelig;cularium intercessionibus, c&aelig;terisque mundanis respectibus, minime attentis" (without any regard to the interference of secular rulers, or to other human considerations). That he meant thereby what is now known as the right of exclusion cannot, indeed, be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>; according to the foregoing account of its origin such claim did not then exist. <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "&AElig;terni Patris Filius" (15 November, 1621, in "Magnum Bullarium", III, 444 sqq.) declared authoritatively:

<blockquote><p>"Cardinales omnino abstineant ab omnibus pactionibus, conventionibus, promissionibus, intendimentis, condictis, foederibus, aliis quibuscunque obligationibus, minis, signis, contrasignis suffragiorum seu schedularum, aut aliis tam verbo quam scripto aut quomodocunque dandis aut petendis, tam respectu inclusionis quam exclusionis, tam unius person quam plurium aut certi generis, etc.",</p></blockquote>

<p>the sense of which is, that the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> must abstain from all agreements, and from acts of any kind, which might be construed as binding them to include or exclude any one candidate, or several, or candidates of a certain class. It may be that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> does not even here refer to exclusion by a state, but only to the so-called "ballot of exclusion"; it has already been stated, however, that the governments at this time laid claim to a formal right of exclusion. In the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Apostolatus officium" (11 October, 1732, in "Magnum Bullarium", XIV, 248 sqq.) <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a> ordered the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> in the words of <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, already quoted, to elect, "principum s&aelig;cularium intercessionibus c&aelig;terisque mundanis respectibus . . . minime attentis et postpositis" (i.e. without regard to the interference of secular rulers or to other human considerations).

<p>By this time, however, governmental exclusion had long been the accepted form of the interference of secular rulers (intercessio principum) in papal elections. It is, therefore, precisely this exclusion which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> forbids. This command has all the more weight since we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was urged to recognize, within certain limits, the right of exclusion put forth by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> states; in the minutes of the deliberations of the commission of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> appointed to draw up this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> the right of exclusion is explicitly characterized as an abuse. By the Constitution "In h&acirc;c sublimi", of 23 August, 1871 (Archiv f&uuml;r kath. Kirchenrecht, 1891, LXV, 303 sqq.), <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> forbade any interference of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> in papal elections.

<p>It is plain, therefore, that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> have rejected all right of exclusion by a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> state in a papal election. Nor can it be admitted that this right has arisen through custom. None of the requisites essential to the growth of a customary right are present; reasonableness and prescription are especially lacking. To debar precisely the most capable candidates is an onerous limitation of the liberty of the electors, and injurious to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Moreover, the cases of exclusion by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> states are too few to permit the inference of a right acquired by customary possession. Recent legislation by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pope Pius X</a> has absolutely repudiated and abolished forever this <em>Jus Exclusivae</em>. In the Constitution "Commissum Nobis" (20 Jan., 1904) he declared that the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> had never approved the civil veto, though previous legislation had not succeeded in preventing it: "Wherefore in virtue of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> obedience, under threat of the Divine judgment, and pain of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> <em>lat&aelig; sententi&aelig;</em> . . . . . we prohibit the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy Roman Church</a>, all and single, and likewise the Secretary of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College of Cardinals</a>, and all others who take part in the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a>, to receive even under the form of a simple desire the office of proposing the veto in whatever manner, either by writing or by word of mouth . . . . . And it is our will that this prohibition be extended . . . . . to all intercessions, etc. . . . . by which the lay powers endeavour to intrude themselves in the election of a pontiff . . . . .

<p>"Let no man infringe this our inhibition . . . . . under pain of incurring the indignation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God Almighty</a> and of his Apostles, Sts. Peter and Paul." The new form of <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to be taken by all <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> contains these words: "we shall never in any way accept, under any pretext, from any <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> whatever, the office of proposing a veto of exclusion even under the form of a mere desire . . . and we shall never lend favour to any intervention, or intercession, or any other method whatever, by which the lay powers of any grade or order may wish to interfere in the election of a pontiff".
