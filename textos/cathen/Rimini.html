<h1>Rimini</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF RIMINI (ARIMINUM).

<p>Suffragan of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. Rimini is situated near the coast between the rivers Marecchia (the ancient Ariminus) and Ausa (Aprusa). Coast navigation and fishing are the principal industries. The thirteenth-century <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> (San Francesco) was originally Gothic, but was transformed by order of <a href="../cathen/09566a.htm">Sigismondo Malatesta</a> (1446-55) according to the designs of Leone Baptista Alberti and never completed; the <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> is lacking, also the upper part of the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>; in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> are the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of Sigismondo and his wife Isotta. The plastic decorations of the main <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> and some of the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, a glorification to Sigismondo and Isotta, are by Agostino di Duccio, and breathe the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> spirit of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. On the southern side are the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of illustrious <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanists</a>, among them that of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> <a href="../cathen/12166a.htm">Gemistus Pletho</a>, whose remains were brought back by Sigismondo from his <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> in the Balkans. There is a remarkable fresco of Piero della Francesca. In San Giuliano is the great picture of <a href="../cathen/03169b.htm">Paul Veronese</a> representing the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of that saint, also pictures of Bittino da Faenza (1357) dealing with some episodes of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> life. Among the profane edifices are the Arch of Augustus (27 B. C.), the remains of an amphitheatre, and the five-arched bridge of Augustus over the Marecchia. The town hall has a small but valuable gallery (Perin del Vaga, <a href="../cathen/06545a.htm">Ghirlandajo</a>, Bellini, Benedetto Coda, Tintoretto, Agostino di Duccio); the Gambalunga Library (1677) has valuable <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. There is an arch&aelig;ological museum and a bronze <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>; the castle of <a href="../cathen/09566a.htm">Sigismondo Malatesta</a> is now used as a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>.

<p>Ariminum was built by the Umbri. In the sixth century B.C. it was taken by the Gauls; after their last defeat (283) it returned to the Umbri and became in 263 a Latin colony, very helpful to the Romans during the late Gallic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. Rimini was reached by the Via Flamminia, and here began the Via &AElig;milia that led to <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>. <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> did much for the city and Galla Placida built the church of San Stefano. When the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> conquered Rimini in 493, Odoacer, besieged in <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, had to capitulate. During the Gothic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> Rimini was taken and retaken many times. In its vicinity Narses overthrew (553) the Alamanni. Under Byzantine dominion it belonged to the Pentapolis. In 728 it was taken with many other cities by the Lombard King Liutprand but returned to the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> about 735. King Pepin gave it to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, but during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and the Italian cities against the emperors, Rimini sided with the latter. In the thirteenth century it suffered from the discords of the Gambacari and Ansidei <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. In 1295 <a href="../cathen/09566a.htm">Malatesta I da Verucchio</a> was named "Signore" of the city, and, despite interruptions, his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> held authority until 1528. Among his successors were: Malatesta II (1312-17); Pandolfo I, his brother (d. 1326), named by Louis the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> imperial vicar in Romagna; Ferrantino, son of Malatesta II (1335), opposed by his cousin Ramberto and by Cardinal Bertando del Poggetto (1331), <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>; Malatesta III, Guastafamiglia (1363), lord also of <a href="../cathen/11738b.htm">Pesaro</a>; Malatesta IV l'Ungaro (1373); Galeotto, uncle of the former (1385), lord also of <a href="../cathen/05785a.htm">Fano</a> (from 1340), <a href="../cathen/11738b.htm">Pesaro</a>, and Cesena (1378); his son Carlo (1429), the noblest scion of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, laboured for the cessation of the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Western Schism</a>, and was the counsellor, protector, and ambassador of <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>, and patron of scholars; Galeotto Roberto (1432); his brother Sigismondo Pandolf (1468) had the military and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> qualities of Carlo Malatesta but not his character. He was tyrannous and perfidious, in constant rebellion against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, a good soldier, poet, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, and lover of the <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a>, but a monster of domestic and public vices; in 1463 he submitted to <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>, who left him Rimini; Robert, his son (1482), under <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a> nearly lost his state and under <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> became the commanding officer of the pontifical army against Alfonso of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, by whom he was defeated in the battle of Campo Morto (1482); Pandolfo V, his son (1500), lost Rimini to Cesare Borgia (1500-3), after whose overthrow it fell to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> (1503-9), but was retaken by <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> and incorporated with the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">territory of the Holy See</a>. After the death of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> Pandolfo returned for several months, and with his son Sigismondo held tyrannous rule. <a href="../cathen/01159b.htm">Adrian VI</a> gave Rimini to the Duke of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> vicar. In 1527 Sigismondo managed to regain the city, but the following year the <a href="../cathen/09566a.htm">Malatesta</a> dominion passed away forever. Rimini was thenceforth a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> city, subject to the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> at Forl&igrave;. In 1845 a band of adventurers commanded by Ribbotti entered the city and proclaimed a constitution which was soon abolished. In 1860 Rimini and the Romagna were incorporated with the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>.

<p>Rimini was probably evangelized from <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. Among its traditional <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> are: St. Innocentia and companions; Sts. Juventinus, Facundinus, and companions; Sts. Theodorus and Marinus. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was probably established before the peace of Constantine. Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were: Stennius, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 313; Cyriacus, one of his successors, sided with the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>; under <a href="../cathen/06393c.htm">St. Gaudentius</a> the famous <a href="../cathen/13057b.htm">Council of Rimini</a> was held (359); he was later <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> for having <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Marcianus; Stephanus attended at Constantinople (551); the election of Castor (591) caused much trouble to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory I</a>, who had to send to Rimini a "visitor"; Agnellus (743) was governor of the city subject to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>; Delto acted frequently as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> for <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a>; Blessed Arduino (d. in 1009); Uberto II is mentioned with praise by <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a>; Opizo was one of the consecrators of the <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Antipope Clement III</a> (Guiberto, 1075); Ranieri II degli Uberti (1143) <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the ancient <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. Colomba; Alberigo (1153) made peace between Rimini and Cesena; Bonaventura Trissino founded the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of Santo Spirito; under Benno (1230) some <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> ladies founded a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, and themselves cared for the afflicted. At the end of the thirteenth century the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> received at Rimini a church and a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. From 1407 <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> resided at Rimini. Giovanni Rosa united the eleven <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> of Rimini into one. Under Giulio Parisani (1549) the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was opened (1568). Giambattista Castelli (1569) promoted the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> reforms and was <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Andrea Minucci was severely tried during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>; under him the <a href="../cathen/09566a.htm">Malatesta</a> church (San Francesco) became the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has 124 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 125,400 inhabitants, 336 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 10 houses of religious with 56 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 24 houses of religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who care for the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>, or communal and private <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. There are also 1 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys and 3 for girls.
