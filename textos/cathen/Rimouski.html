<h1>Rimouski</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF RIMOUSKI (SANCTI GERMANI DE RIMOUSKI)

<p>Suffragan of Quebec, comprises the counties of Bonaventure, Gasp&eacute; (except Magdalen Islands), Rimouski and the greater part of Temiscouata, and forms the eastern extremity of the province of Quebec. At the extreme point of the Gasp&eacute; peninsula (formerly called Honguedo), Jacques Cartier landed on his first voyage of discovery (1534) and planted a cross with the royal arms of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The Souriquois or <a href="../cathen/10283b.htm">Micmacs</a> occupied the shores of Baie des Chaleurs, and their successive missionaries, Recollets, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, amongst them Father Labrosse, and Spiritians (or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of the Holy Ghost), including the celebrated Pierre Maillard, ministered to that region of the Rimouski diocese. The first <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated near the city of Rimouski, at a place since called Pointe-au-P&egrave;re, by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Henri Nouvel, in 1663, on his way to the Papinachois and Montagnais of Tadoussac, on the north shore. The first settler at Rimouski was Germain Lepage (1696), whose patronymic was chosen as titular of the future <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and diocese. The seigniory had been conceded to his son Ren&eacute; in 1688. The latest statistics give 120 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, with 148 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Two wooden churches were built at Rimouski, in 1712 and 1787 respectively; the first stone church, 1824, was replaced by the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in 1854. Before the creation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, Rimouski was successively visited by Bishops Hubert (1791), <a href="../cathen/04717b.htm">Denaut</a> (1798), Plessis (1806-14-22), Panet (1810-26), Signay (1833-38-43), Turgeon (1849), and <a href="../cathen/02206b.htm">Baillargeon</a> (1855-60-65). The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was created and its first titular nominated on 15 January, 1867, and acquired civil incorporation <em>ipso facto</em> the same day, according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the country.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Jean-Pierre-Fran&ccedil;ois Laforce-Langevin, was b. at Quebec, 22 Sept., 1821, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> on 12 Sept., 1844. as director of the Quebec <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> he was one of the joint founders of <a href="../cathen/09047b.htm">Laval University</a> (1852). He successively filled the offices of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of Ste Claire and Beauport, and of principal of Laval Normal School. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 1 may, 1867, resigned 1891, and died 1892. He completed the organization of a classical college previously founded by the Abb&eacute;ss <a href="../cathen/14443a.htm">C. Tanguay</a> and G. Potvin and adopted it as the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He introduced the Sisters of the Congregation of Notre-Dame (Montreal) and sanctioned the foundation (1879) of the Sisters of the Most Holy Rosary, a flourishing institute largely due to the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> Langevin, his brother. Bishop Langevin established the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter in 1878.

<p>The second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, still in office, Andr&eacute;-Albert Blais, b. at St-Vallier, P.Q., 1842, studied at the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Ste Anna de la Pocati&egrave;re, graduated in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> Doctor of Canon Law, and taught the same branch at <a href="../cathen/09047b.htm">Laval University</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> 18 May, 1890, and took possession of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1891. Bishop Blais created many new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and founded a normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> under the management of the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, exclusively <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French-Canadian</a>, study classics and philosophy at the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> principally at <a href="../cathen/09047b.htm">Laval University</a>, in some cases at the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. (For <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> system, incorporation of religious institutions, etc. see <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">CANADA</a>, and PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.) There are no cities besides Rimouski, but all the larger rural <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> have fine churches and convent-schools; the only domestic mission is that of the <a href="../cathen/10283b.htm">Micmacs</a> at Ristigouche, under the care of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>. Besides a Priests' Aid Society, there are several benevolent and mutual aid <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> for the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of men are the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/05596b.htm">Eudists</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04539b.htm">Brothers of the Cross of Jesus</a>; those of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, Sisters of Charity, of the Good Shepherd (teaching), of the Holy Rosary, of the Holy Family, and the <a href="../cathen/08374a.htm">Daughters of Jesus</a>. Retreats for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are given each year; conferences to discuss <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> cases take place every three months. Nearly all the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> (110 out of 137) belong to the Eucharistic league. Out of a total <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 118,740, only 3695 are not <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a>. The Indians number 610. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> element amounts to 8798. There is no friction between these different elements and no difficult racial problem to solve, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> containing an English-speaking element as well as the <a href="../cathen/10283b.htm">Micmacs</a> being instructed in their native tongues.
