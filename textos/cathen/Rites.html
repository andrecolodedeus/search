<h1>Rites</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Name and definition</h2>

<p><em>Ritus</em> in classical Latin in means primarily, the form and manner of any religious observance, so Livy, 1, 7: "Sacra diis aliis albano ritu, gr&aelig;co Herculi ut ab Evandro instituta erant (Romulus) facit"; then, in general, any custom or usage. In English the word "rite" ordinarily means, the ceremonies, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and functions of any religious body, whether <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>, Jewish, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a>, or <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. But here we must distinguish two uses of the word. We speak of any one such religious function as a rite &#151; the rite of the blessing of palms, the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> rite, etc. In a slightly different sense we call the whole complex of the services of any Church or group of Churches a rite-thus we speak of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, Byzantine Rite, and various Eastern rites. In the latter sense the word is often considered equivalent to <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a>, which, however, in the older and more proper use of the word is the Eucharistic Service, or Mass; hence for a whole series of religious functions "rite" is preferable.

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> rite, in this sense comprises the manner of performing all services for the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the sanctification of men. This includes therefore: (1) the administration of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, among which the service of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, as being also the Sacrifice, is the most important element of all; (2) the series of psalms, lessons, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, etc., divided into unities, called "hours", to make up together the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>; (3) all other religious and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions, called <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a>. This general term includes <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> (such as a <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a>, the blessing of an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, various ceremonies performed for <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, the reconciliation of public penitents, Benediction of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> etc.), <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> of things (the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a church, altar, <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, etc.), and a number of devotions and ceremonies, e.g. processions and the taking of <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. Sacraments, the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a> (in a wide sense) make up the rite of any <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> religious body. In the case of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> these three elements must be modified to suit their <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> opinions.
<h2 id="section2">Difference of rite</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has never maintained a principle of uniformity in rite. Just as there are different local <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> in various parts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whereas certain fundamental <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> are obeyed by all, so <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in different places have, their own local or national rites; they say <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and perform ceremonies that have evolved to suit people of the various countries, and are only different expressions of the same fundamental <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>. The essential elements of the functions are obviously the same everywhere, and are observed by all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rites in obedience to the command of Christ and the Apostles, thus in every rite is administered with water and the invocation of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>; the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> is celebrated with <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> over which the words of institution are said; penance involves the confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. In the amplification of these essential elements in the accompanying <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and practical or ceremonies, various customs have produced the changes which make the different rites. If any rite did not contain one of the essential notes of the service it would be invalid in that point, if its <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> or ceremonies expressed <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a> it would he <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>. Such rites would not be tolerated in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But, supposing uniformity in essentials and in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has never insisted on uniformity of rite; <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> has never resented the fact that other people have their own expressions of the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> is the most, venerable, the most archaic, and immeasurably the most important of all, but our fellow <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the East have the same right to their traditional <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> as we have to ours. Nor can we <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that other rites too have many beautiful <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and ceremonies which add to the richness of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> inheritance. To lose these would be a misfortune second only to the loss of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a>, "Pr&aelig;clara" (20 June, 1894), expressed the traditional attitude of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> when he wrote of his reverence for the venerable able rites of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a> and assured the schismatics, whom be invited to reunion, that there was no jealousy of these things at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; that for all Eastern customs "we shall provide without narrowness."

<p>At the time of the Schism, Photius and <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Cerularius</a> hurled against Latin rites and customs every conceivable absurd accusation. The Latin fast on Saturday, <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> fare, <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">law of celibacy</a>, confirmation by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and especially the use of unleavened bread for the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> were their accusations against the West. Latin <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> replied that both were right and suitable, each for the people who used them, that there was no need for uniformity in rite if there was unity in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that one good custom did not prove another to be bad, thus defending their customs without attacking those of the East. But the Byzantine patriarch was breaking the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a>, denying the primacy, and plunging the East into <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. In 1054, when <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Cerularius's</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> had begun, a <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Dominic of Gradus and Aquileia, wrote concerning it to Peter III of Antioch. He discussed the question <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Cerularius</a> had raised, the use of <a href="../cathen/02171a.htm">azymes</a> at Mass, and carefully explained that, in using this bread, Latins did not intend to disparage the Eastern custom of consecrating leavened bread, for there is a symbolic reason for either practice. "Because we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the sacred mixture of fermented bread is used and lawfully observed by the most holy and <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a>, we faithfully approve of both customs and confirm both by a spiritual explanation" (Will, "Acta et scripta qu&aelig; de controversiis ecclesi&aelig; gr&aelig;c&aelig; et latin&aelig; s&aelig;c. XI composite extant", Leipzig, 1861, 207). These words represent very well the attitude of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> towards other rites at all times. Three points, however, may seem opposed to this and therefore require some explanation: the supplanting of the old <a href="../cathen/06357a.htm">Gallican Rite</a> by that of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> almost throughout the West, the modification of <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> rites, the suppression of the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> rites.



<p>The existence of the <a href="../cathen/06357a.htm">Gallican Rite</a> was a unique anomaly. The natural principle that rite follows <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> has been sanctioned by universal tradition with this one exception. Since the first organization of <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a> there has been an ideal of uniformity throughout each. The close bond that joined <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> to their patriarch involved the use of his liturgy, just as the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> follow the rite of their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Before the arbitrary imposition of the Byzantine Rite on all Orthodox Churches no Eastern patriarch would have tolerated a foreign liturgy in his domain. All <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> used the Alexandrine Rite, all <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> that of Antioch-Jerusalem, all <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, and the Balkan lands, that of Constantinople. But in the vast Western lands that make up the Roman <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, north of the Alps and in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, various local rites developed, all bearing a strong resemblance to each other, yet different from that of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself. These form the Gallican <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>. Abbot Cabrol, Dom Cagin, and other writers of their <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> think that the <a href="../cathen/06357a.htm">Gallican Rite</a> was really the original <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> before <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> modified it Pal&eacute;ographie musicale V, <a href="../cathen/14133b.htm">Solesmes</a>, 1889; Cabrol, Les origines liturgiques <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> 1906). Most writers, however, maintain with Mgr Duchesne ("Origines du culte Chr&eacute;tien", Paris, 1898, 8489), that the <a href="../cathen/06357a.htm">Gallican Rite</a> is Eastern, Antiochene in origin. Certainly it has numerous Antiochene peculiarities (see <a href="../cathen/06357a.htm">GALLICAN RITE</a>), and when it emerged as a complete rite in the sixth and seventh centuries (in Germanus of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, etc.), it was different from that in use at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at the time. Non-Roman <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> were used at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, even at Gobble at the gates of the Roman province (<a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I's</a> letter to Decentius of Eugubium; Ep. xxv, in P.L., XX, 551-61). <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent</a> (401-17) naturally protested against the use of a foreign rite in Umbria; occasionally other <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> showed some desire for uniformity in their <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, but the great majority regarded the old state of things with perfect indifference. When other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> asked them how ceremonies were performed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> they sent descriptions (so <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Pope Vigilius</a> to Profuturus of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> in 538; Jaff&eacute;, "Regesta Rom. Pont.", n. 907), but were otherwise content to allow different uses. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory I</a> (590-604) showed no anxiety to make the new English Church conform to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but told St. Augustine to take whatever rites he thought most suitable from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> or Gaul (Ep. xi, 64, in P.L., LXXVII, 1186-7).

<p>Thus for centuries the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> alone among <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> did not enforce their own rite even throughout their <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. The gradual romanization and subsequent disappearance of Gallican rites were (beginning in the eighth and ninth centuries), the work not of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> but of local <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and kings who naturally wished to conform to the use of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. The Gallican Rites varied everywhere (Charles the Great gives this as his reason for adopting the Roman Use; see Hauck, "Kirchengesch. Deutschlands", 11, 107 sq.), and the inevitable desire for at least local uniformity arose. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops'</a> frequent visits to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> brought them in contact with the more dignified ritual observed by their chief at the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the Apostles, and they were naturally influenced by it in their return home. The local <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> ordered conformity to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The romanizing movement in the West came from below. In the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom Charles the Great, as part of his scheme of unifying, sent to <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Adrian I</a> for copies of the Roman books, commanding their use throughout his domain. In the history of the substitution of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> for the Gallican the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> appear as spectators, except perhaps in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and much later in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. The final result was the application in the West of the old principle, for since the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was undoubtedly <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the West it was inevitable, that sooner or later the West should conform to his rite. The places, however, that really cared for their old local rites (Milan, Toledo) retain them even now.

<p>It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the changes made in some <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> rites by the Roman correctors have not always corresponded to the best <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> tradition. There are as Mgr Duchesne says, "corrections inspired by <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> that was not always according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>" (Origines du culte, 2nd ed., 69), but they are much fewer than is generally supposed and have never been made with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of romanizing. Despite the general prejudice that <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> rites are mere mutilated hybrids, the strongest impression from the study of them is how little has been changed. Where there is no suspicion of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a>, as in the Byzantine Rite, the only change made was the restoration of the name of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> where the schismatics had erased it. Although the question of the procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> has been so fruitful a source of dispute between <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Constantinople the <em>Filioque </em>clause was certainly not contained in the original creed, nor did the Roman authorities insist on its addition. So <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is content that Eastern <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> should keep their traditional form unchanged, though they believe the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>. The <em>Filioque</em> is only sung by those Byzantine Uniats who wish it themselves, as the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>. Other rites were altered in places, not to romanize but only to eradicate passages suspected of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. All other Uniats came from <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a>, <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>, or <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelete</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, whose rites had been used for centuries by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Hence, when bodies of these people wished to return to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> their services were keenly studied at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for possible <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. In most cases corrections were absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Liturgy, for instance, did not contain the words of institution, which had to be added to the Liturgy of the converted Chaldees. The <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>, <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> have in the Trisagion the fateful clause: "who wast crucified for us", which has been the watchword of <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a> ever since Peter the Dyer of Antioch added it (470-88). If only because of its associations this could not remain in a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Liturgy.

<p>In some instances, however, the correctors were over scrupulous. In the Gregorian <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Liturgy the words said by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> at the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, long before the Consecration: "The body of the Lord and the blood of the Saviour are set forth (or "are before us") (Brightman, "Eastern Liturgies", 430) were in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> Rite changed to: "are about to be before us". The Uniats also omit the words sung by the Gregorian choir before the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a>: "Christ has been manifested amongst us (has appeared in the midst of us)" (ibid., 434), and further change the cherubic <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> because of its anticipation of the Consecration. These misplacements are really harmless when understood, yet any reviser would be shocked by such strong cases. In many other ways also the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Rite shows evidence of Roman influence. It has unleavened bread, our confession and <em>Judica</em> psalm at the beginning of Mass, a Lavabo before the Canon, the last Gospel, etc. But so little is this the effect of union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> that the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> have all these points too. They date from the time of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, vehemently opposed to the Orthodox, made many advances towards <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. So also the strong romanizing of the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> Liturgy was entirely the work of the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a> themselves, when, surrounded by enemies in the East, they too turned towards the great <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, sought her communion, and eagerly copied her practices. One can hardly expect the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to prevent other Churches from imitating Roman customs. Yet in the case of Uniats he does even this. A Byzantine <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who uses unleavened bread in his Liturgy incurs <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. The only case in which an ancient Eastern rite has been wilfully romanized is that of the <a href="../cathen/14678a.htm">Uniat Malabar Christians</a>, where it was not Roman authority but the misguided <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Alexius de Menezes, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, and his Portuguese advisers at the Synod of Diamper (1599) which spoiled the old Malabar Rite.

<p>The Western <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> rites are in no case (except the Ambrosian and Mozarabic RiteRites), really independent of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. They are merely the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> with local additions and modifications, most of which are to its disadvantage. They are late, exuberant, and inferior variants, whose ornate additions and long interpolated tropes, sequences, and farcing destroy the dignified simplicity of the old liturgy. In 1570 the revisers appointed by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> restored with scrupulous care and, even in the light of later studies, brilliant success the pure Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, which <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> ordered should alone be used wherever the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> is followed. It was a return to an older and purer form. The <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> rites have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> a certain arch&aelig;ological interest; but where the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> is used it is best to use it in its pure form. This too only means a return to the principle that rite should follow <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. The reform was made very prudently, <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> allowing any rite that could prove an existence of two centuries to remain (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Quo primum", 19 July, 1570, printed first in the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>), thus saving any local use that had a certain antiquity. Some <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> (e.g. Lyons) and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders (Dominicans, <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>), therefore keep their special uses, and the independent Ambrosian and Mozarabic RiteRites, whose loss would have been a real misfortune (see <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">LITURGY</a>, <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">LITURGY OF THE MASS</a>) still remain.

<p>Rome then by no means imposed uniformity of rite. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are united in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and discipline, but in their manner of performing the sacred functions there is room for variety based on essential unity, as there was in the first centuries. There are cases (e.g. the Georgian Church) where union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> has saved the ancient use, while the schismatics have been forced to abandon it by the centralizing policy of their authorities (in this case <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>). The ruthless destruction of ancient rites in favour of uniformity has been the work not of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> but of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of Constantinople. Since the thirteenth century Constantinople in its attempt to make itself the one centre of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> has driven out the far more venerable and ancient Liturgies of Antioch and Alexandria and has compelled all the Orthodox to use its own late derived rite. The Greek Liturgy of St. Mark has ceased to exist; that of St. James has been revived for one or two days in the year at Zakynthos and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> only (see <a href="../cathen/01571a.htm">ANTIOCHENE LITURGY</a>). The Orthodox all the world over must follow the Rite of Constantinople. In this unjustifiable centralization we have a defiance of the old principle, since Antioch, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, in no way belong to the Byzantine Patriarchate. Those who accuse the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> of sacrificing everything for the sake of uniformity mistake the real offender, the oecumenical patriarch.
<h2 id="section3">The old rites (Catholic and schismatical)</h2>

<p>A complete table of the old rites with an account of their mutual relations will be found in the article <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">LITURGY</a>. Here it need only be added that there is a <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> body using each of the Eastern rites. There is no ancient rite that is not represented within the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. That rite, <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language, and religious body connote three totally different <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> has been explained at length in the article <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">GREEK RITES</a>. The rite a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> follows is no test at all of his religion. Within certain broad limits a member of any Eastern <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> might use any rite, for the two categories of rite and religion cross each other continually. They represent quite different classifications: for instance, liturgically all <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> belong to one class, theologically a <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> belongs to the same class as Latins, Chaldees, <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a>, etc., and has nothing to do with his Gregorian (<a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>) fellow-countrymen (see <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">EASTERN CHURCHES</a>). Among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> the rite forms a group; each rite is used by a branch of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that is thereby a special, though not separate, entity. So within the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity we speak of local Churches whose characteristic in each case is the rite they use. Rite is the only basis of this classification. Not all <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> or Byzantine Uniats obey the same patriarch or local authority; yet they are "Churches" individual provinces of the same great Church, because each is bound together by their own rites. In the West there is the vast <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, in the East the Byzantine, Chaldean, Coptic, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a>, <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a>, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, and Malabar <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat Churches</a>. It is of course possible to subdivide and to speak of the national Churches (of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, etc.) under one of these main bodies (see <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">LATIN CHURCH</a>). In modern times rite takes the place of the old classification in <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a> and provinces.
<h2 id="section4">Protestant rites</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in the sixteenth century produced a new and numerous series of rites, which are in no sense continuations of the old development of liturgy. They do not all represent descendants of the earliest rites, nor can they be classified in the table of genus and species that includes all the old <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. The old rites are unconscious and natural developments of earlier ones and go back to the original fluid rite of the first centuries (see <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">LITURGY</a>). The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> rites are deliberate compositions made by the various <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> to suit their <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> positions, as new services were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> meetings. No old liturgy could be used by people with their <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. The old rites contain the plainest statements about the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a>, the Eucharistic Sacrifice, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and for the dead, which are denied by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> occurred in the West, where the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> in its various local forms had been used for centuries. No Reformed <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> could use the Roman Mass; the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> derived rites were still more ornate, explicit, in the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers'</a> sense <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a>. So all the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> abandoned the old Mass and the other ritual functions, composing new services which have no continuity, no direct relation to any historic liturgy. However, it is hardly possible to compose an entirely new <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> service without borrowing anything. Moreover, in many cases the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> wished to make the breach with the past as little obvious as could be. So many of their new services contain fragments of old rites; they borrowed such elements as seemed to them harmless, composed and re-arranged and evolved in some cases services that contain parts of the old ones in a new order. On the whole it is surprising that they changed as much as they did. It would have been possible to arrange an imitation of the Roman Mass that would have been much more like it than anything they produced.

<p>They soon collected fragments of all kinds of rites, Eastern, Roman, Mozarabic, etc., which with their new <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> they arranged into services that are hopeless <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> tangles. This is specially <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Prayer-books</a>. In some cases, for instance, the placing of the Gloria after the Communion in Edward VI's second <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Prayer-book</a>, there seems to be no object except a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of change. The first <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> services kept most of the old order. The <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> arrangements had from the first no connexion with any earlier rite. The use of the vulgar tongue was a great principle with the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> at first compromised with Latin, but soon the old language disappeared in all <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> services. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> in 1523 published a tract, "Of the order of the service in the parish" ("Von ordenung gottis diensts [sic] ynn der gemeine" in Clemen, "Quellenbuch zur prakt. Theologie", 1, 24-6), in which he insists on preaching, rejects all "unevangelical" parts of the Mass, such as the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of sacrifice, invocation of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and ceremonies, and denounces private Masses <em>(Winkelmessen), </em>Masses for the dead, and the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> as a mediator. Later in the same year he issued a "Formula miss&aelig; et communionis pro ecclesia Vittebergensi" (ibid., 26-34), in which he omits the preparatory <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a>, all the Canon to <em>qui pridie</em>, from <em>Unde et memores </em>to the Pater, the embolism of the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>, fraction, <em>Ite missa est. </em>The Preface is shortened, the Sanctus is to be sung after the words of institution which are to be said aloud, and meanwhile the elevation may be made because of the weak who would be offended by its sudden omission (ibid., IV, 30). At the end he adds a new <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, a blessing from <a href="../bible/num006.htm#vrs24">Numbers 6:24-26</a>. Latin remained in this service.

<p>Karlstadt began to hold vernacular services at <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> since 1521. In 1524 Kaspar Kantz published a German service on the lines of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> "Formula miss&aelig;" (Lohe, "Sammlung liturgischer Formul&auml;re III, N&ouml;rdlingen, 1842, 37 sq.); so also Thomas M&uuml;nzer the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptist</a>, in 1523 at Alstedt (Smend, "Die evang. deutschen Messen", 1896, 99 sq.). A number of compromises began at this time among the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, services partly Latin and partly vernacular (Rietschel, "Lehrbuch der Liturgik", 1, 404-9). Vernacular <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> took the place of the old Proper (<a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a>, etc.). At last in 1526 <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> issued an entirely new German service, "Deudsche Messe und ordnung Gottis diensts" (Clemen, op. cit., 3443), to be used on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, whereas the "Formula miss&aelig;", in Latin, might be kept for week-days. In the "Deudsche Messe" "a spiritual song or German psalm" replaces the <a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a>, then follows <a href="../cathen/08714a.htm">Kyrie eleison</a> in Greek three times only. There is no Gloria. Then come the Collects, Epistle, a German <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>, Gospel, Creed, Sermon, Paraphrase of the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>, words of institution with the account of the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a> from <a href="../bible/1co011.htm#vrs20">1 Corinthians 11:20-9</a>, <a href="../cathen/05380b.htm">Elevation</a> (always kept by <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> himself in spite of Karlstadt and most of his colleagues), Communion, during which the Sanctus or a <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> is sung, Collects, the blessing from <a href="../bible/num006.htm#vrs24">Numbers 6:24-26</a>. Except the Kyrie, all is in German; azyme bread is still used but declared indifferent; Communion is given under both kinds, though <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> preferred the unmixed <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>. This service remained for a long time the basis of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> Communion function, but the local branches of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> from the beginning used great freedom in modifying it. The <a href="../cathen/12080c.htm">Pietistic</a> movement in the eighteenth century, with its scorn for forms and still more the present <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a>, have left very little of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> scheme. A vast number of <em>Agend&aelig;, Kirchenordnungen, </em>and <a href="../cathen/12350a.htm">Prayer-books</a> issued by various <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> consistories from the sixteenth century to our own time contain as many forms of celebrating the Lord's Supper. Pastors use their own discretion to a great extent, and it is impossible to foresee what service will be held in any <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> church. An arrangement of <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, Bible readings (generally the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a>), a sermon, then the words of institution and Communion, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> (often extempore), more <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, and the blessing from <a href="../bible/num006.htm">Numbers 6</a>, make up the general outline of the service.

<p>Zwingli was more radical than <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. In 1523 he kept a form of the Latin Mass with the omission of all he did not like in it ("De canone miss&aelig; epichiresis" in Clemen, op. cit., 43-7), chiefly because the town council of <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a> feared too sudden a change, but in 1525 he overcame their scruples and issued his "Action oder bruch (=Brauch) des nachtmals" (ibid., 47-50). This is a complete breach with the Mass an entirely new service. On <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a> the men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are to receive communion, on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> those of "middle age", on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a> only the oldest <em>(die alleraltesten). </em>These are the only occasions on which the service is to be held. The arrangement is: a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> said by the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> facing the people, reading of <a href="../bible/1co011.htm#vrs20">1 Corinthians 11:20-29</a>, Gloria in Excelsis, "The Lord be with you" and its answer, reading of <a href="../bible/joh006.htm">John 6:47-63</a>, <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a>, an address to the people, <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>, extempore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, words of institution, Communion (under both kinds in wooden vessels), <a href="../bible/psa113.htm">Psalm 113</a>, a short <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of thanksgiving; the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> says: "Go in peace". On other <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> there is to be no Communion at all, but a service consisting of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, Our Father, sermon, general confession, <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, blessing. Equally radical was the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. In 1535 through Farel's influence the Mass was abolished in Geneva. Three times a year only was there to be a commemorative Supper in the baldest form; on other <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> the sermon was to suffice. In 1542 <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> issued "La forme des pri&egrave;res eccl&eacute;siastiques" (Clemen, op. cit., 51-8), a supplement to which describes "La mani&egrave;re de c&eacute;l&eacute;brer la c&egrave;ne" (ibid., 51-68). This rite, to be celebrated four times yearly, consists of the reading of <a href="../bible/1co011.htm">1 Corinthians 11</a> an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of various kinds of sinners, and long exhortation. "This being done, the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> distribute the bread and the cup to the people, taking care that they approach reverently and in good order" (ibid., 60). Meanwhile a psalm is sung or a lesson read from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, a thanksgiving follows (ibid., 55), and a final blessing. Except for their occurrence in the reading of <a href="../bible/1co011.htm">1 Corinthians 11</a>, the words of institution are not said; there is no kind of Communion form. It is hardly possible to speak of rite at all in the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> body.

<p>The other ritual functions kept by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> (<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, confirmation as an introduction to Communion marriage, funerals, appointment of <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>) went through much the same development. The first <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> expunged and modified the old rites, then gradually more and more was changed until little remained of a rite in our sense. Psalms, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, addresses to the people in various combinations make up these functions. The <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> have always been more radical than the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>. The development and multiple forms of these services may be seen in Rietschel, "Lehrbuch der Liturgik", II, and Clemen, "Quellenbuch zur praktischen Theologie", I (texts only). The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican body</a> stands somewhat apart from the others, inasmuch as it has a standard book, almost unaltered since 1662. The first innovation was the introduction of an English <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> under <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> in 1544. Cranmer was preparing further changes when <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> died (see Procter and Frere, "A New History of the <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Book of Common Prayer</a>" London, 1908, 29-35). Under Edward VI (1547-53) many changes were made at once: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>, <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>, the creeping to the Cross were abolished, Mass was said in English (ibid., 39-41), and in 1549 the first <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Prayer-book</a>, arranged by Cranmer, was issued. Much of the old order of the Mass remained, but the Canon disappeared to make way for a new <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> from <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> sources. The "K&ouml;lnische Kirchenordnung" composed by <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> and <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Butzer</a> supplied part of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. The changes are <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a>. In 1552 the second <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Prayerbook</a> took the place of the first. This is the present <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Anglican Book of Common Prayer</a> and represents a much stronger <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> tendency. The commandments take the place of the <a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a> and Kyrie (kept in the first book), the Gloria is moved to the end, the Consecration-prayer is changed so as to deny the Sacrifice and <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a>, the form at the Communion becomes: "Take and eat this in remembrance that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died for thee, and feed on him in thy heart by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with thanksgiving" (similarly for the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>). In 1558 Elizabeth's Government issued a new edition of the second <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Prayer-book</a> of Edward VI with slight modifications of its extreme <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. Both the Edwardine forms for communion are combined. In 1662 a number of revisions were made. In particular the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> forms received additions defining the order to be conferred. A few slight modifications (as to the lessons read, days no longer to be kept) have been made since.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Communion</a> service follows this order: The <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>, Collect for purity, <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">Ten Commandments</a>, Collect for the king and the one for the day, Epistle, Gospel, Creed, sermon, certain sentences from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> (meanwhile a collection is made), <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> militant, address to the people about Communion, general confession and <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, the comfortable words (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs28">Matthew 11:28</a>; <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs16">John 3:16</a>; <a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#vrs15">1 Timothy 1:15</a>; <a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#vrs1">1 John 2:1</a>), Preface, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> ("We do not presume"), Consecration-prayer, Communion at once, <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>, Thanksgiving-prayer, "Glory be to God on high", blessing. Very little of the arrangement of the old Mass remains in this service, for all the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> reject are carefully excluded. The <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Book of Common Prayer</a> contains all the official services of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>, confirmation, marriage, funeral, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, articles of religion, etc. It has also forms of morning and evening <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, composed partly from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Office with many modifications and very considerably reduced. The Episcopal Church in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> has a <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Prayer-book</a>, formed in 1637 and revised in 1764, which is more nearly akin to the first <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Prayer-book</a> of Edward VI and is decidedly more High Church in tone. In 1789 the <a href="../cathen/12493a.htm">Protestant Episcopal Church of America</a> accepted a book based on the English one of 1662, but taking some features from the Scotch services. The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> service-books are now the least removed from <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> of those used by any <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> body. But this is saying very little. The <a href="../cathen/11099a.htm">Non-jurors</a> in the eighteenth century produced a number of curious <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> which in many ways go back to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principles, but have the fault common to all <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> services of being conscious and artificial arrangements of elements selected from the old rites, instead of natural developments (Overton, "The Non-jurors", London, 1902, ch. vi). The <a href="../cathen/08174a.htm">Irvingites</a> have a not very-successful service-book of this type. Many <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodists</a> use the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> book; the other later <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> have for the most part nothing but loose arrangements of <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, readings, extempore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and a sermon that can hardly be called rites in any sense.
<h2 id="section5">Liturgical language</h2>

<p>The language of any Church or rite, as distinct from the vulgar tongue, is that used in the official services and may or may not be the common language. For instance the Rumanian Church uses liturgically the ordinary language of the country, while Latin is used by the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> for her Liturgy without regard to the mother tongue of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> or congregation. There are many cases of an intermediate state between these extremes, in which the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language is an older form of the vulgar tongue, sometimes easily, sometimes hardly at all, understood by people who have not studied it specially. Language is not rite. Theoretically any rite may exist in any language. Thus the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, Coptic, and East Syrian Rites are celebrated always in one language, the Byzantine Rite is used in a great number of tongues, and in other rites one language sometimes enormously preponderates but is not used exclusively. This is determined by church discipline. The Roman Liturgy is generally celebrated in Latin. The reason why a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language began to be used and is still retained must be distinguished in <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> from certain <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> or mystic considerations by which its use may be explained or justified. Each <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language was first chosen because it was the natural language of the people. But languages change and the Faith spreads into countries where other tongues are spoken. Then either the authorities are of a more practical mind and simply translate the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> into the new language, or the conservative <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>, always strong in religion, retains for the liturgy an older language no longer used in common life. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> showed this <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>, when, though Hebrew was a dead language after the Captivity, they continued to use it in the Temple and the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> in the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and still retain it in their services. The <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a>, also conservative, reads the <a href="../cathen/08692a.htm">Koran</a> in classical Arabic, whether he be Turk, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a>, or Afghan. The translation of the church service is complicated by the difficulty of determining when the language in which it is written, as Latin in the West and Hellenistic Greek in the East, has ceased to be the vulgar tongue. Though the Byzantine services were translated into the common language of the Slavonic people that they might be understood, this form of the language (Church-Slavonic) is no longer spoken, but is gradually becoming as unintelligible as the original Greek. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> make a great point of using languages "understanded of the people", yet the language of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> Bible and the <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Anglican Prayerbook</a> is already archaic.
<h3>History</h3>

<p>When <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> appeared Hellenistic Greek was the common language spoken around the Mediterranean. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> writes to people in <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in Greek. When the parent rites were finally written down in the fourth and fifth centuries Eastern <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language had slightly changed. The Greek of these <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> (Apost. Const. VIII, St. James, St. Mark, the Byzantine Liturgy) was that of the Fathers of the time, strongly coloured by the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. These <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> remained in this form and have never been recast in any modern Greek dialect. Like the text of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, that of a liturgy once fixed becomes sacred. The formul&aelig; used Sunday after Sunday are hallowed by too sacred associations to be changed as long as more or less the same language is used. The common tongue drifts and develops, but the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> forms are stereotyped. In the East and West, however, there existed different principles in this matter. Whereas in the West there was no literary language but Latin till far into the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, in the East there were such languages, totally unlike Greek, that had a position, a literature, a dignity of their own hardly inferior to that of Greek itself. In the West every <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> man spoke and wrote Latin almost to the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. To translate the Liturgy into a Celtic or Teutonic language would have seemed as absurd as to write a <a href="../cathen/12350a.htm">prayerbook</a> now in some vulgar slang. The East was never hellenized as the West was latinized. Great nations, primarily <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, kept their own languages and literatures as part of their national inheritance. The people, owing no allegiance to the Greek language, had no reason to say their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in it, and the Liturgy was translated into Coptic in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, into Syriac in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Palestine. So the principle of a uniform <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language was broken in the East and people were accustomed to hear the church service in different languages in different places. This uniformity once broken never became an ideal to <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Christians</a> and the way was opened for an indefinite multiplication of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> tongues.

<p>In the fourth and fifth centuries the Rites of Antioch and Alexandria were used in Greek in the great towns where people spoke Greek, in Coptic or Syriac among peasants in the country. The Rite of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> and Constantinople was always in Greek, because here there was no rival tongue. But when the Faith was preached in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> (from C&aelig;sarea) the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> in taking over the C&aelig;sarean Rite translated it of course into their own language. And the great <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Church in East <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, evolving her own literature in Syriac, naturally used that language for her church services too. This diversity of tongues was by no means parallel to diversity of <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> or religion. People who agreed entirely in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, who were separated by no <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, nevertheless said their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in different languages. <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> clung entirely to the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Constantinople and used the Byzantine Rite, yet used it translated into Syriac. The process of translating the Liturgy continued later. After the Schism of the eleventh century, the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, unlike <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, insisted on uniformity of rite among her members. All the Orthodox use the Byzantine Rite, yet have no <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of one language. When the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> were converted the Byzantine Rite was put into Old Slavonic for them; when Arabic became the only language spoken in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> And <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, it became the language of the Liturgy in those countries. For a long time all the people north of Constantinople used Old Slavonic in church, although the dialects they spoke gradually drifted away from it. Only the Georgians, who are <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> in no sense at all, used their own language. In the seventeenth century as part of the growth of <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumanian</a> national feeling came a great insistence on the fact that they were not <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> either. They Wished to be counted among Western, Latin races, so they translated their <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> into their own Romance language. These represent the old classical <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> languages in the East.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> Churches have kept the old tongues even when no longer spoken; thus they use Coptic in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Syriac in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> and their daughter-Church in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> (Malabar) also use Syriac. The Orthodox have four or five chief <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> languages: Greek, Arabic, Church-Slavonic, and Rumanian. Georgian has almost died out. Later Russian missions have very much increased the number. They have translated the same Byzantine Rite into German, Esthonian, and Lettish for the Baltic provinces Finnish and Tartar for converts in <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a> and Siberia, <a href="../cathen/05539a.htm">Eskimo</a>, a North American Indian dialect, <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a>. Hence no general principle of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language can be established for <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a>, though the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> and <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> have evolved something like the Roman principle and kept their old languages in the liturgy, in spite of change in common talk. The Orthodox services are not, however, everywhere understood by the people, for since these older versions were made language has gone on developing. In the case of converts of a totally different race, such as Chinese or Red Indians, there is an obvious line to cross at once and there is no difficulty about translating what would otherwise be totally unintelligible to them. At home the spoken language gradually drifts away from the form stereotyped in the Liturgy, and it is difficult to determine when the Liturgy ceases to be understood. In more modern times with the growth of new <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> the conservative <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> of the old Churches has grown. The Greek, Arabic, and Church-Slavonic texts are jealously kept unchanged though in all cases they have become archaic and difficult to follow by uneducated people. Lately the question of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language has become one of the chief difficulties in <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>. Especially since the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> Schism the Phanar at Constantinople insists on Greek in church as a sign of Hellenism, while the people clamour for Old-Slavonic or Rumanian.

<p>In the West the whole situation is different. Greek was first used at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, too. About the third century the services were translated into the vulgar tongue, Latin (see <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">LITURGY OF THE MASS</a>), which has remained ever since. There was no possible rival language for many centuries. As the Western barbarians became civilized they accepted a Latin culture in everything, having no literatures of their own. Latin was the language of all <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> people, so it was used in church, as it was for books or even letter-writing. The Romance people drifted from Latin to Italian, Spanish, French, etc., so gradually that no one can say when Latin became a dead language. The vulgar tongue was used by peasants and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> people only; but all books were written, lectures given, and solemn speeches made in Latin. Even <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> (d. 1321) thought it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to write an apology for Italian (De vulgari eloquentia). So for centuries the Latin language was that, not of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but of the Roman <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. When people at last realized that it was dead, it was too late to change it. Around it had gathered the associations of <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Christendom</a>; the music of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> was composed and sung only to a Latin text; and it is even now the official tongue of he Roman Court. The ideal of uniformity in rite extended to language also, so when the rebels of the, sixteenth century threw over the old language, sacred from its long use, as they threw over the old rite and Id <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, conservative in all these things, would not give way to them. As a bond of union among the many nations who make up he Latin <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, she retains the old Latin tongue with one or two small exceptions. Along he Eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> has been used in Slavonic (with the <a href="../cathen/06575b.htm">Glagolitic</a> letters) since the eleventh century, and the Roman Mass is said in Greek on rare occasions at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>It is a question how far one may speak of a special <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> Latin language. The writers of our Collects, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, Prefaces, etc., wrote simply in the language of their time. The style of the various elements of the Mass and <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> varies greatly according to the time at which they were written. We have texts from the fourth or fifth to the twentieth century. Liturgical Latin then is simply late <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Christian Latin</a> of various periods. On the other hand the Liturgy had an influence on the style of <a href="../cathen/09026a.htm">Christian Latin writers</a> second only to that of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. First we notice Hebraisms (<em>per omnia soecula soeculorum</em>), many Greek constructions (<em>per Dominum nostrum</em>, meaning" for the sake of", <em>dia</em>) and words (<em>Eucharistia, litania, episcopus</em>), expressions borrowed from Biblical metaphors (<em><a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, liber proedestinationis, crucifigere carnem, lux, vita, Agnus Dei</em>), and words in a new <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sense (<em>humilitas, compunctio, caritas</em>). <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> in his <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> more than any one else helped to form <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> style. His constructions and phrases occur repeatedly in the non-Biblical parts of the <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> and <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a>. The style of the fifth and sixth centuries (<a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo I</a>, <a href="../cathen/03477c.htm">Celestine I</a>, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory I</a>) forms perhaps the main stock of our services. The medi&aelig;val <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a> (<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>) and their technical terminology have influenced much of the later parts, and the Latin of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> is an important element that in many cases overlays the ruder forms of earlier times. Of this <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> Latin many of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> lessons are typical examples; a comparison of the earlier forms of the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> with the improved forms drawn up by order of <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> (1623-44) will convince any one how disastrous its influence was. The tendency to write inflated phrases has not yet stopped: almost any modern Collect compared with the old ones in the "Gelasian Sacramentary" will show how much we have lost of style in our <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.
<h3>Use of Latin</h3>

<p>The principle of using Latin in church is in no way fundamental. It is a question of discipline that evolved differently in East and West, and may not be defended as either primitive or universal. The authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> could change the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language at any time without sacrificing any important principle. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a universal tongue may seem attractive, but is contradicted by the fact that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> uses eight or nine different <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> languages. Latin preponderates as a result of the greater influence of the Roman <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> and its rite, caused by the spread of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> into new lands and the unhappy <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of so many Easterns (see Fortescue, "Orthodox Eastern Church", 431). Uniformity of rite or <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language has never been a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ideal, nor was Latin chosen deliberately as a sacred language. Had there been any such <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> the language would have been Hebrew or Greek.

<p>The objections of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> to a Latin Liturgy can be answered easily enough. An argument often made from <a href="../bible/1co014.htm#vrs4">1 Corinthians 14:4-18</a>, is of no value. The whole passage treats of quite another thing, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesying</a> in tongues that no one understands, not even the speaker (see 14: "For if I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in a tongue, my spirit <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayeth</a> but my understanding is without fruit"). The other argument, from practical convenience, from the loss to the people who do not understand what is being said, has some value. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has never set up a mysterious unintelligible language as an ideal. There is no principle of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> mysteries from which the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> is shut out. In spite of the use of Latin the people have means of understanding the service. That they might do so still better if everything were in the vulgar tongue may be admitted, but in making this change the loss would probably be greater than the gain.

<p>By changing the language of the Liturgy we should lose the principle of uniformity in the Roman <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. According to the ancient principle that rite follows <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, the Western rite should be that of the Western patriarch, the Roman Bishop, who uses the local rite of the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. There is a further advantage in using it in his language, so the use of Latin in the West came about naturally and is retained through conservative <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>. It is not so in the East. There is a great practical advantage to travellers, whether <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, in finding their rite exactly the same everywhere. An <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> or <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> could not say his Mass unless he and the server had a common language. The use of Latin all over the Roman <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> is a very obvious and splendid witness of unity. Every <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> traveller in a country of which he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the language has felt the comfort of finding that in church at least everything is familiar and knows that in a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church of his own rite he is at home anywhere. Moreover, the change of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language would be a break with the past. It is a witness of antiquity of which a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> may well be proud that in Mass today we are still used to the very words that Anselm, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, Leo sang in their <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>. A change of language would also abolish Latin chant. Plainsong, as venerable a relic of antiquity as any part of the ritual, is composed for the Latin text only, supposes always the Latin syllables and the Latin accent, and becomes a caricature when it is forced into another language with different rules of accent.

<p>These considerations of antiquity and universal use always made proportionately (since there are the Eastern <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> rites) but valid for the Roman <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> may well outweigh the practical convenience of using the chaos of modern languages in the liturgy. There is also an &aelig;sthetic advantage in Latin. The splendid dignity of the short phrases with their rhythmical accent and terse style redolent of the great <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, the strange beauty of the old Latin <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, the sonorous majesty of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, all these things that make the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> so dignified, so characteristic of the old Imperial City where the Prince of the Apostles set up his throne, would be lost altogether in modern English or French translations. The impossibility of understanding Latin is not so great. It is not a secret, unknown tongue, and till quite lately every <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> understood it. It is still taught in every <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not clothe her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in a secret language, but rather takes it for granted that people understand Latin. If <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> learned enough Latin to follow the very easy style of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> language all difficulty would be solved. For those who cannot take even this trouble there is the obvious solution of a translation. The <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> in English is one of the easiest books to procure; the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> may follow in that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> that lack of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> prevents their understanding without it.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> languages used by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are: <br><em>1. Latin </em>in the Roman, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a>, and Mozarabic RiteRites (except in parts of <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>). <br><em>2. Greek </em>in the Byzantine Rite (not exclusively). <br><em>3. Syriac </em>in the Syrian, <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a>, Chaldean, and Malabar Rites. <br>4. Coptic in the Coptic Rite. <br><em>5. <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> </em>by all the Churches of that rite. <br><em>6. Arabic </em>by the <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a> (Byzantine Rite). <br><em>7. Slavonic </em>by <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> of the Byzantine Rite and (in <a href="../cathen/06575b.htm">Glagolitic</a> letters) in the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> in <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>. <br><em>8.

<h2 id="section6">Liturgical science</h2>
<h3 id="A">Rubrics</h3>

<p>The most obvious and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> study for <a href="../cathen/11727a.htm">ecclesiastical persons</a> is that of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> that regulate the performance of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> functions. From this point of view <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> study is a branch of canon law. The rules for the celebration of the Holy Mysteries, administration of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, etc., are part of the positive law of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, just as much as the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> about <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, or <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">oblige</a> those whom they concern under pain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. As it is therefore the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them, they are studied in all colleges and <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> as part of the training of future <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and candidates are examined in them before <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>. Because of its special nature and complication <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> in this sense is generally treated apart from the rest of canon law and is joined to similar practical matters (such as preaching, visiting the sick, etc.) to make up the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of pastoral theology. The sources from which it is learned are primarily the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> (the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, and Ritual). There are also treatises which explain and arrange these <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a>, adding to them from later decrees of the S. Congregation of Rites. Of these Martinucci has not yet been displaced as the most complete and authoritative, Baldeschi has long been a favourite and has been translated into English, De Herdt is a good standard book, quite sound and clear as far as it goes but incomplete, Le Vavasseur is perhaps the most practical for general purposes.
<h3 id="B">History</h3>

<p>The development of the various rites, their spread and mutual influence, the origin of each <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, etc., form a part of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> whose importance is becoming more and more realized. For practical purposes all a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> need <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> are the present rules that affect the services he has to perform, as in general the present <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are all we have to obey. But just as the student of history needs to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the decrees of former <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, even if abrogated since, as he studies the history of earlier times and remote provinces of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, because it is from these that he must build up his conception of her continuous life, so the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> student will not be content with knowing only what affects him now, but is prompted to examine the past to inquire into the origin of our present rite and study other rites too as expressions of the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in other lands. The history of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> that deeply affect the life of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in many ways, that are the foundation of many other objects of study (architecture, art, music, etc.) is no inconsiderable element of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>. In a sense this study is comparatively new and not yet sufficiently organized though to some extent it has always accompanied the practical study of liturgy. The great medi&aelig;val <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgists</a> were not content with describing the rites of their own time. They suggested historical reasons for the various ceremonies and contrasted other practices with those of their own Churches. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV's</a> treatise on the Mass discusses the origin of each element of the Latin liturgy. This and other books of seventeenth and eighteenth-century liturgiologists are still standard works. So also in lectures and works on liturgy in our first sense it has always been the custom to add historical notes on the origin of the ceremonies and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.

<p>But the interest in the history of liturgy for its own sake and the systematic study of early documents is a comparatively new thing. In this <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> led the way and still takes the foremost place. It followed the <a href="../cathen/11370a.htm">Oxford Movement</a> as part of the revived interest in the early Church among <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a>. W. Palmer (Origines liturgic&aelig;) and J. M. Neale in his various works are among those who gave the first impulse to this movement. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Daniel Rock ("Hierurgia" and "The Church of our Fathers") further advanced it. It has now a large <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of followers. F.C. Brightman's edition of "Eastern Liturgies" is the standard one used everywhere. The monumental editions of the "Gelasian Sacramentary" by H.A. Wilson and the "Leonine Sacramentary" by C. L. Feltoe, the various essays and discussions by E. Bishop, C. Atchley, and many others keep up the English standard. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> <a href="../cathen/07058a.htm">Dom Gu&eacute;ranger</a> (L'ann&eacute;e liturgique) and his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> opened a new epoch. Mgr Duchesne supplied a long-felt want with his "Origines du suite chr&eacute;tien", Dom Cabral and Dom Leclereq ("Mon. eccl. lit.", etc., especially the monumental "Dict. d'arch. chr&eacute;t. et de liturgie") have advanced to the first place among modern authorities on historical liturgy. From <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> we have the works of H. Daniel (Codex lit. eccl. univers&aelig;), Probst, <a href="../cathen/14554a.htm">Thalhofer</a>, Gihr, and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of living students (Drews, Rietschel, Baumstark, Buchwald, Rauschen). In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> good work is being done by Semeria, Bonaccorsi, and others. Nevertheless the study of liturgy hardly yet takes the place it deserves in the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of church students. Besides the practical instruction that forms a part of pastoral theology, lectures on <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> history would form a valuable element of the course of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>. As part of such a course other rites would be considered and compared. There is a fund of deeper understanding of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> to be drawn from its comparison with others, Gallican or Eastern. Such instruction in liturgiology should include some notion of ecclesiology in general, the history and comparison of church planning and architecture, of vestments and <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a>. The root of all these things in different countries is the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> they serve and adorn.
<h3>Dogmatic value</h3>

<p>The dogmatic and apologetic value of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> is a very important consideration to the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>. It must, of course, be used reasonably. No Church intends to commit herself officially to every statement and implication contained in her official books, any more than she is committed to everything said by her Fathers. For instance, the Collect for <a href="../cathen/08556a.htm">St. Juliana Falconieri</a> (19 June) in the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> refers to the story of her <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> communion before her death, told at length in the sixth lesson of her Office, but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of that story is not part of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Liturgies give us arguments from tradition even more valuable than those from the Fathers, for these statements have been made by thousands of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> day after day for centuries. A consensus of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> is, therefore, both in space and time a greater witness of agreement than a consensus of Fathers, for as a general principle it is obvious that people in their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> say only what they believe. This is the meaning of the well known axiom: <em>Lex orandi lex credendi</em>. The <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers for the dead</a>, the passages in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is asked to accept this Sacrifice, the statements of the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a> in the oldest <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> are unimpeachable witnesses of the Faith of the early Church as to these points. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> on the Immaculate Conception ("Ineffabilis Deus", 8 Dec., 1854) contains a classical example of this argument from liturgy. Indeed there are few <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> that cannot be established or at least confirmed from <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>. The Byzantine Office for St. Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (29 June) contains plain statements about Roman primacy. The study of liturgy from this point of view is part of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>. Of late years especially <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theologians</a> have given much attention to it. Christian Pesch, S.J., in his "Pr&aelig;lectiones theologi&aelig; dogmatic&aelig;" (9 vols., Freiburg i. Br.) quotes the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> texts for the theses as part of the argument from tradition. There are then these three aspects under which liturgiology should be considered by a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, as an element of canon law, <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>. The history of its study would take long to tell. There have been liturgiologists through all the centuries of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. Briefly the state of this <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> at various periods is this:

<p>Liturgiologists in the Ante-Nicene period, such as <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin Martyr</a>, composed or wrote down descriptions of ceremonies performed, but made no examination of the sources of rites. In the fourth and fifth centuries the scientific study of the subject began. <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose's</a> "Liberde Mysteriis" (P.L., XVI, 405-26) the anonymous (pseudo-Ambrose) "De Sacramentis" (P.L., XVI, 435-82), various treatises by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (e.g., "Contra Vigilantium" in P.L., XXIII, 354-367) and St. Augustine, <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem's</a> "Catechetical Instructions" (P.L., XXXIII, 331-1154) and the famous "Peregrinatio Silv&aelig;" (in the "Corpus script. eccl. Latin. of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>: "Itinera hierosolymitana", 35-101) represent in various degrees the beginning of an examination of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> texts. From the sixth to the eighth centuries we have valuable texts (the Sacramentaries and Ordines) and a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> treatise of <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">St. Isidore of Seville</a> ("De eccl. officiis" in P.L., LXXXIII). The <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> revival of the eighth and ninth centuries began the long line of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> liturgiologists. <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> (P.L., C-CI), <a href="../cathen/01376b.htm">Amalarius of Metz</a> (P.L., XCIX, CV), Agobard (P.L., CIV), Florus of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> (P.L., CXIX, 15-72), <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a> (P.L., CVII-CXII), and Walafrid Strabo (P.L., CXIV, 916--66) form at this time a galaxy of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> scholars of the first importance. In the eleventh century <a href="../cathen/02512c.htm">Berno of Constance</a> ("Micrologus" in P.L., CLI, 974-1022), in the twelfth Rupert of Deutz ("De divinis officiis" in P.L., CLXX, 9-334), <a href="../cathen/07461a.htm">Honorius of Autun</a> ("Gemma anim&aelig;" and "De Sacramentis" in P.L., CLXXII), John Beleth ("Rationale div. offic." in P.L., CCII, 9-166), and Beroldus of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (ed. Magistretti, Milan, 1894) carry on the tradition. In the thirteenth century see DURANDUS) is the most famous of all the William Durandus of <a href="../cathen/10180a.htm">Mende</a> ("Rationale div. medieval liturgiologists. There is then a break till the sixteenth century. The discussions of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> period called people's attention again to <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, either as defenses of the old Faith or as sources for the compilation of reformed services.

<p>From this time editions of the old rites were made for students, with commentaries. <a href="../cathen/04058a.htm">J. Clichtove</a> ("Elucidatorium eccl.", Paris, 1516) and J. Cochl&aelig;us ("Speculum ant. devotionis", Mainz, 1549) were the first editors of this kind. Claude de Sainctes, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05671a.htm">Evreux</a>, published a similar collection ("Liturgi&aelig; sive miss&aelig; ss. Patrum", Antwerp, 1562). Pamelius's "Liturgies. latin." (Cologne, 1571) is a valuable edition of Roman, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a>, and Mozarabic texts. <a href="../cathen/07380a.htm">Melchior Hittorp</a> published a collection of old commentaries on the liturgy ("De Cath. eccl. div. offic." Cologne, 1568) which was re-edited in <a href="../cathen/02566a.htm">Bigne's</a> "Bibl. vet. Patrum.", X (Paris, 1610). The seventeenth century opened a great period. B. Gavanti ("Thesaurus sacr. rituum", re-edited by Merati, Rome, 1736-8) and H. Menard, O.S.B. ("Sacramentarium Gregorianum" in P.L., LXXVIII) began a new line of liturgiologists. J. Goar, O.P. ("Euchologion", Paris, 1647), and <a href="../cathen/01317b.htm">Leo Allatius</a> in his various dissertations did great things for the study of Eastern rites. The Oratorian J. Morin ("Comm. hist. de disciplina in admin. Sac. Poen." <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> 1651, and "Comm. de sacris eccl. ordinationibus", Paris, 1655). Cardinal John Bons ("Rerum lit. libri duo", Rome, 1671), <a href="../cathen/06573a.htm">Card. Tommasi</a> ("Codices sacramentorum", Rome, 1680; "Antiqui libri missarum", Rome, 1691), <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">J. Mabillon, O.S.B.</a> ("Mus&aelig;um Italicum" <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> 1687-9), E. Mart&egrave;ne, O.S.B. (" De ant. eccl. ritibus; Antwerp, 1736-8), represent the highest point of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> study. Dom Claude de Vert wrote a series of treatises on <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> matters. In the eighteenth century the most important names are: <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> ("De SS. Sacrificio Miss&aelig;", republished at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, 1879), <a href="../cathen/12769a.htm">E. Renaudot</a> ("Lit. orient. collectio", Paris, 1716), the four Assemani, <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a> ("Kalendaria eccl. univers&aelig;", Rome, 1755; "Codex lit. eccl. univers&aelig;", Rome, 1749-66, etc.) Muratori ("Liturgia romana vetus", Venice, 1748). So we come to the revival of the nineteenth century, <a href="../cathen/07058a.htm">Dom Gu&eacute;ranger</a> and the modern authors already mentioned.

<h2>Benedictine Rite</h2>

<p>The only important rite peculiar to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a> is the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> (Breviarium Monasticum). St. Benedict devotes thirteen chapters (viii-xx), of his rule to regulating the <a href="../cathen/07500b.htm">canonical hours</a> for his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> is the outcome of this regulation. It is used not only by the so-called <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Black Benedictines</a>, but also by the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, <a href="../cathen/11244c.htm">Olivetans</a>, and all those orders that have the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a> as their basis. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> are not at liberty to substitute the Roman for the Monastic <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>; by using the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> they would not satisfy their <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of saying the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>. Each congregation of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> has its own <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> calendar.

<p>MICHAEL OTT
<h2>Carmelite Rite</h2>

<p>The rite in use among the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> since about the middle of the twelfth century is known by the name of the Rite of the Holy Sepulchre, the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Rule, which was written about the year 1210, ordering the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> of Mount Carmel to follow the approved custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which in this instance meant the Patriarchal Church of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: "Hi qui litteras noverunt et legere psalmos, per singulas horas eos dicant qui ex institutione sanctorum patrum et ecelesi&aelig; approbata consuetudine ad horas singulas sunt deputati." This Rite of the Holy Sepulchre belonged to the Gallican <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>; it appears to have descended directly from the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Parisian</a> Rite, but to have undergone some modifications pointing to other sources. For, in the Sanctorale we find influences of Angers, in the proses traces of meridional sources, while the lessons and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> on <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a> are purely Roman. The fact is that most of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who accompanied the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a> were of French nationality; some even belonged to the Chapter of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by documentary evidence. Local influence, too, played an important part. The Temple itself, the Holy Sepulchre, the vicinity of the Mount of Olives, of Bethany, of Bethlehem, gave rise to magnificent ceremonies, connecting the principal events of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> year with the very localities where the various episodes of the work of Redemption has taken place. The rite is known to us by means of some <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> one (Barberini 659 of A.D. 1160) in the Vatican <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, another at Barletta, described by Kohler (Revue de I'Orient Latin, VIII, 1900-01, pp. 383-500) and by him ascribed to about 1240.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> on Mount Carmel were bound by rule only to assemble once a day for the celebration of Mass, the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> being recited privately. Lay brothers who were able to read might recite the Office, while others repeated the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> a certain number of times, according to the length and solemnity of the various offices. It may be presumed that on settling in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> (from about A.D. 1240) the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> conformed to the habit of the other <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> with respect to the choral recitation or chant of the Office, and there is documentary evidence that on Mount Carmel itself the choral recitation was in force at least in 1254. The General Chapter of 1259 passed a number of regulations on <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> matters, but, owing to the loss of the acts, their nature is unfortunately not known. Subsequent chapters very frequently dealt with the rite chiefly adding new feasts, changing old established customs, or revising <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a>. An Ordinal, belonging to the second half of the thirteenth century, is preserved at <a href="../cathen/15057a.htm">Trinity College</a>, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, while portions of an Epistolarium of about 1270 are at the Maglia, becchiana at Florence (D6, 1787). The entire Ordinal was rearranged and revised in 1312 by Master Sibert de Beka, and rendered <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> by the General Chapter, but it experienced some difficulty in superseding the old one. Manuscripts of it are preserved at Lambeth (London), <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, and else where. It remained in force until 1532, when a (committee was appointed for its revision; their work was approved in 1539, but published only in 1544 after the then General Nicholas Audet had introduced some further changes. The, reform of the Roman <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> under <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a> called for a corresponding reform of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Rite, which was taken in hand in 1580, the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> appearing in 1584 and the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> in 1587. At the same time the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> withdrew the right hitherto exercised by the chapters and the generals of altering the liturgy of the order, and placed all such matters in the hands of the Sacred Congregation of Rites. The publication of the Reformed <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> of 1584 caused the newly established Discaleed <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> to abandon the ancient rite once for all and to adopt the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> instead. Besides the various <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the Ordinal already mentioned, we have examined a large number of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">missals</a> and breviaries preserved in public and private <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> in the United Kingdom, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and other countries. We have seen most of the early prints of the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> enumerated by Weale, as well as some not mentioned by him, and the breviaries of 1480, 1490, 1504, 1516 (Hor&aelig;), 1542, 1568, 1575, and 1579.

<p>Roughly speaking, the ancient <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Rite may be said to stand about half way between the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> rites. It shows signs of great antiquity &#151; e.g. in the absence of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> colours, in the sparing use of <a href="../cathen/01347a.htm">altar candles</a> (one at low <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>, none on the altar itself at high Mass but only <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes'</a> torches, even these being extinguished during part of the Mass, four torches and one candle in choir for Tenebr&aelig;); <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, likewise, is used rarely and with noteworthy restrictions; the Blessing at the end of the Mass is only permitted where the custom of the country requires it; passing before the tabernacle, the brethren are directed to make a profound inclination, not a genuflexion. Many other features might be quoted to show that the whole rite points to a period of transition. Already according to the earliest Ordinal Communion is given under one species, the days of general Communion being seven, later on ten or twelve a year with leave for more frequent Communion under certain conditions. Extreme Unction was administered on the eyes, ears, nostrils, mouth, both hands (the palms, with no distinction between <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and others) and the feet <em>superius. </em>The Ordinal of 1312 on the contrary orders the hands to be anointed <em>exterius, </em>but also without distinction for the priests; it moreover adds another anointing on the breast <em>(super pectus: per ardorem libidinis).</em>

<p>In the Mass there are some peculiarities. the altar remains covered until the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> are ready to begin, when the <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a> then roll back the cover; likewise before the end of the Mass they cover the altar again. On great feasts the <a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a> is said three times, i.e. it is repeated both before and after the <em>Gloria Patri; </em>besides the Epistle and Gospel there is a lesson or prophecy to be recited by an <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a>. At the <em>Lavabo </em>the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> leaves the altar for the piscina where he says that psalm, or else <em>Veni Creator Spiritus </em>or <em>Deus misereatur. </em>Likewise after the first ablution he goes to the piscina to wash his fingers. During the Canon of the Mass the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> moves a fan to keep the flies away, a custom still in use in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and elsewhere. At the word <em>fregit</em> in the form of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, according to the Ordinal of 1312 and later <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a>, makes a movement as if breaking the host. Great care is taken that the smoke of the thurible and of the torches do not interfere with the clear vision of the host when lifted up for the adoration of the faithful; the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, however, is only slightly elevated. The celebrating <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> does not genuflect but bows reverently. After the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Pater Noster</a> the choir sings the psalm <em>Deus venerunt genies </em>for the restoration of the Holy Land. The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for communion are identical with those of the <a href="../cathen/13479a.htm">Sarum Rite</a> and other similar uses, viz. <em>domine sancte pater, Domine Jesu Christe </em>(as in the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>), and <em>Salve salus mundi. </em>The <em>Domine non sum dignus </em>was introduced only in 1568. The Mass ended with <em>Dominus vobiscum, Ite missa est </em>(or its equivalent) and <em>Placeat. </em>The chapter of 1324 ordered the <em>Salve regina </em>to be said at the end of each canonical hour as well as at the end of the Mass. The Last Gospel, which in both ordinals serves for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> thanksgiving, appears in the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> of 1490 as an integral part of the Mass. On <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feasts there was, besides the festival Mass after <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">Terce</a> or Sext, an early Mass <em>(matutina) </em>without solemnities, corresponding to the commemorations of the Office. From <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> till <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> the Sunday Mass was therefore celebrated early in the morning, the high Mass being that of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of our Lord</a>; similarly on these <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> the ninth lesson with its <a href="../cathen/12787a.htm">responsory</a> was taken from one of the <a href="../cathen/11516a.htm">Easter</a> days; these customs had been introduced soon after the conquest of the Holy Land. A solemn commemoration of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> was held on the last Sunday before <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a>; in all other respects the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Liturgy reflects more especially the devotion of the order towards the Blessed Virgin.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> also presents some noteworthy features. The first <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> of certain feasts and the <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> during <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> have a <a href="../cathen/12787a.htm">responsory</a> usually taken from <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a>. <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Compline</a> has various <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> according to the season, and also special <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a> for the Canticle. The lessons at <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a> follow a somewhat different plan from those of the Roman Office. The singing of the genealogies of Christ after <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a> on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> and the Epiphany gave rise to beautiful ceremonies. After Tenebr&aelig; in <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a> (sung at midnight) we notice the chant of the <em>Tropi; </em>all the <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a> services present interesting archaic features. Other points to be mentioned are the <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a> <em>Pro fidei meritis </em>etc. on the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> from Trinity to <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> and the verses after the psalms on Trinity, the feasts of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, and St. Laurence. The <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> are those of the Roman Office; the proses appear to be a uniform collection which remained practically unchanged from the thirteenth century to 1544, when all but four or five were abolished. The Ordinal prescribes only four processions in the course of the year, viz. on <a href="../cathen/03245b.htm">Candlemas</a>, <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">Ascension</a>, and the Assumption.

<p>The calendar of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, in the two oldest recensions of the Ordinal, exhibits some feasts proper to the Holy Land, namely some of the early <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, the Patriarchs <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, and Lazarus. The only special features were the feast of <a href="../cathen/01538a.htm">St. Anne</a>, probably due to the fact that the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> occupied for a short time a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> dedicated to her in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (vacated by <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> at the capture of that city in 1187), and the octave of the Nativity of Our Lady, which also was proper to the order. In the works mentioned below we have given the list of feasts added in the course of three centuries, and shall here speak only of a few. The Chapter of 1306 introduced those of St. Louis, Barbara, <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>, and the Conception of Our Lady (<em>in Conceptione seu potius veneratione sanctificationis B. V.</em>); the <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> procession, however, dates only from the end of the fifteenth century. In 1312 the second part of the <em>Confiteor, </em>which till then had been very short, was introduced. Daily commemorations of St. Anne and Sts. Albert and Angelus date respectively from the beginning and the end of the fifteenth century, but were transferred in 1503 from the canonical Office to the Little Office of Our Lady. The <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the "Three Maries" dates from 1342, those of the Visitation, of Our Lady <em>ad nives, </em>and the Presentation from 1391. Feasts of the order were first introduced towards the end of the fourteenth century &#151; viz. the Commemoration (<a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">Scapular Feast</a>) of 16 July appears first about 1386; St. Eliseus, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> and <a href="../cathen/04595a.htm">St. Cyril of Constantinople</a> in 1399; <a href="../cathen/01261b.htm">St. Albert</a> in 1411; St. Angelus in 1456. Owing to the printing of the first <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> of the order at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> in 1480, a number of territorial feasts were introduced into the order, such as St. Joseph, the <a href="../cathen/09746a.htm">Ten Thousand Martyrs</a>, the Division of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. The <em>raptus </em>of St. Elias (17 June) is first to be found in the second half of the fifteenth century in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; the feast of the Prophet (20 July) dates at the earliest from 1551. Some general chapters, especially those of 1478 and 1564, added whole lists of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, partly of real or supposed <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the order, partly of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> whose bodies were preserved in various churches belonging to the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, particularly that of San Martino ai Monti in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The revision of 1584 reduced the Sanctorale to the smallest possible dimensions, but many feasts then suppressed were afterwards reintroduced.

<p>A word must be added about the singing. The Ordinal of 1312 allows <em>fauxbourdon, </em>at least on solemn occasions; organs and organists are mentioned with ever-increasing frequency from the first years of the fifteenth century, the earliest notice being that of Mathias Johannis de Lucca, who in 1410 was elected <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organist</a> at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>; the organ itself was a gift of Johannes Dominici Bonnani, surnamed Clerichinus, who died at an advanced age on 24 Oct., 1416.

<p>BENEDICT ZIMMERMAN
<h2>Cistercian Rite</h2>

<p>This rite is to be found in the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> of the order. The collection, composed of fifteen books, was made by the General Chapter of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, most probably in 1134; they are now included in the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, Ritual, and calendar, or Martyrology. When <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> ordered the entire Church to conform to the Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> and <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, he exempted the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> from this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, because their rite had been more than 400 years in existence. Under Claude Vaussin, General of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> (in the middle of the seventeenth century), several reforms were made in the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> of the order, and were approved by <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>, <a href="../cathen/04028a.htm">Clement IX</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a>. These approbations were confirmed by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> on 7 Feb., 1871, for the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> of the Common as well as for those of the Strict Observance. The <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> is quite different from the Roman, as it follows exactly the prescriptions of the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>, with a very few minor additions. St. Benedict wished the entire <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> recited each week; twelve psalms are to be said at <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a> when there are but two <a href="../cathen/11087b.htm">Nocturns</a>; when there is a third <a href="../cathen/11087b.htm">Nocturn</a>, it is to be composed of three divisions of a canticle, there being in this latter case always twelve lessons. Three psalms or divisions of psalms are appointed for Prime, the Little Hours, and <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Compline</a> (in this latter hour the "Nunc dimittis" is never said), and always four psalms for <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>. Many minor divisions and directions are given in <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">St. Benedict's Rule</a>.

<p>In the old <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">missal</a> before the reform of Claude Vaussin, there were wide divergences between the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> and Roman rites. The psalm "Judica" was not said, but in its stead was recited the "Veni Creator"; the "Indulgentiam" was followed by the "Pater" and "Ave", and the "Oramus te Domine" was omitted in <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissing</a> the altar. After the "Pax Domini sit semper vobiscum", the "Agnus Dei" was said thrice, and was followed immediately by "H&aelig;c sacrosancta commixtio corporis", said by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> while placing the small fragment of the Sacred Host in the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>; then the "Domine Jesu Christe, Fili Dei Vivi" was said, but the "Corpus Tuum" and "Quod ore sumpsimus" were omitted. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> said the "Placeat" as now, and then "Meritis et precibus istorum et onmium sanctorum. Suorum misereatur nostri Omnipotens Dominus. Amen", while <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissing</a> the altar; with the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the Cross</a> the Mass was ended. Outside of some minor exceptions in the wording and conclusions of various <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, the other parts of the Mass were the same as in the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>. Also in some Masses of the year the ordo was different; for instance, on <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a> the Passion was only said at the high Mass, at the other Masses a special gospel only being said. However, since the time of Claude Vaussin the differences from the Roman Mass are insignificant.

<p>In the calendar there are relatively few feasts of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> or other modern feasts, as none were introduced except those especially prescribed by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian Order</a>; this was done in order to adhere as closely as possible to the spirit of St. Benedict in prescribing the weekly recitation of the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a>. The divisions of the feasts are: major or minor feast of sermon; major or minor feast of two Masses; feast of twelve lessons and Mass; feast of three lessons and Mass; feast of commemoration and Mass; then merely a commemoration; and finally the feria.

<p>The differences in the ritual are very small. As regards the last <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, Extreme Unction is given before the <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">Holy Viaticum</a>, and in Extreme Unction the word "Peccasti" is used instead of the "Deliquisti" in the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a> a shorter form of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> may be used in ordinary confessions.

<p>EDMOND M. OBRECHT
<h2>Dominican Rite</h2>

<p>A name denoting the distinctive <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> embodied in the <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privileged</a> <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of Preachers</a>.
<h3 id="A">Origin and development</h3>

<p>The question of a special unified rite for the order received no official attention in the time of <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a>, each province sharing in the general <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> diversities prevalent throughout the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at the time of the order's confirmation (1216). Hence, each province and often each <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> had certain peculiarities in the text and in the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> and the recitation of the Office. The successors of St. Dominic were quick to recognize the impracticability of such conditions and soon busied themselves in an effort to eliminate the embarrassing distinctions. They maintained that the safety of a basic principle of community life unity of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and worship-was endangered by this conformity with different <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> conditions. This <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> was impressed upon them more forcibly by the confusion that these <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> diversities occasioned at the general chapters of the order where brothers from every province were assembled.

<p>The first indication of an effort to regulate <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> conditions was manifested by Jordan of Saxony, the successor of St. Dominic. In the Constitutions (1228) ascribed to him are found several <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> for the recitation of the Office. These insist more on the attention with which the Office should be said than on the qualifications of the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a>. However, it is said that Jordan took some steps in the latter direction and compiled one Office for universal use. Though this is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that his efforts were of little practical value, for the Chapters of Bologna (1240) and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1241) allowed each <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> to conform with the local rites. The first systematic attempt at reform was made under the direction of John the Teuton, the fourth master general of the order. At his suggestion the Chapter of Bologna (1244) asked the delegates to bring to the next chapter (Cologne, 1245) their special <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> for the recitation of the Office, their Missals, Graduals, and Antiphonaries, "pro concordando officio". To bring some kind of order out of chaos a commission was appointed consisting of four members, one each from the Provinces of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, to carry out the revision at Angers. They brought the result of their labours to the Chapter of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1246), which approved the compilation and ordered its exclusive use by the whole Order. This same chapter approved the "Lectionary" which had been entrusted to Humbert of Romains for revision. The work of the commission was again approved by the Chapters of <a href="../cathen/10531a.htm">Montepulciano</a> (1247) and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1248).

<p>But dissatisfaction with the work of the commission was felt on all sides, especially with their interpretation of the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a>. They had been hurried in their work, and had left too much latitude for local customs. The question was reopened and the Chapter of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> (1250) asked the commission to reassemble at <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> and revise their work in the light of the criticisms that had been made; the result of this revision was approved at the Chapters of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> (1251) and Bologna (1252) and its use made <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> for the whole order. It was also <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> that one copy of the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> should be placed at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and one at Bologna, from which the books for the other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> should be faithfully copied. However, it was recognized that these books were not entirely perfect, and that there was room for further revision. Though this work was done under the direction of John the Teuton, the brunt of the revision fell to the lot of Humbert of Romains, then <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> Province. Humbert was elected Master General of the Chapter of Buda (1254) and was asked to direct his attention to the question of the order's <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a>. He subjected each of them to a most thorough revision, and after two years submitted his work to the Chapter of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1256). This and several subsequent chapters endorsed the work, effected legislation guarding against corruption, constitutionally recognized the authorship of Humbert, and thus once and for all settled a common rite for the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of Preachers</a> throughout the world.
<h3 id="B">Preservation</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a>, through the general, John of <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>, issued a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> in 1267 in which he lauded the ability and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Humbert and forbade the making of any changes without the proper authorization. Subsequent <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> regulation went much further towards preserving the integrity of the rite. <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> and <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a> prohibited the printing of the books without the permission of the master general and also <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> that no member of the order should presume to use in his fulfilment of the choral <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> any book not bearing the seal of the general and a reprint of the pontifical Decrees. Another force preservative of the special <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Rite was the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> (1570), imposing a common rite on the universal Church but excepting those rites which had been approved for two hundred years. This exception gave to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of Friars Preachers</a> the privilege of maintaining its old rite, a privilege which the chapters of the order sanctioned and which the members of the order gratefully accepted. It must not be thought that the rite has come down through the ages absolutely without change. Some slight corruptions crept in despite the rigid legislation to the contrary. Then new feasts have been added with the permission of the Roman Pontiffs and many new editions of the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> have been printed. Changes in the text, when they have been made, have always been effected with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of eliminating arbitrary mutilations and restoring the books to a perfect conformity with the old exemplars at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Bologna. Such were the reforms of the Chapters of Salamanca (1551), <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1777), and Ghent (1871). Several times movements have been started with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of conforming with the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>; but these have always been defeated, and the order still stands in possession of the rite conceded to it by Pope Clement in 1267.
<h3 id="C">Sources of the rite</h3>

<p>To determine the sources of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Rite is to come face to face with the haze and uncertainty that seems to shroud most <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> history. The thirteenth century <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no unified <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>. While the basis of the usages of north-western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> was a Gallicanized-Gregorian Sacramentary sent by <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Adrian I</a> to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, each little locality had its own peculiar distinctions. At the time of the unification of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Rite most of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the order were embraced within the territory in which the old <a href="../cathen/06357a.htm">Gallican Rite</a> had once obtained and in which the Gallico-Roman Rite then prevailed. Jordan of Saxony, the pioneer in <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> reform within the a order, greatly admired the Rite of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and frequently assisted at the recitations of the Office at Notre-Dame. Humbert of Romains, who played so important a part in the work of unification, was the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the French Province. These facts justify the opinion that the basis of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Rite was the typical <a href="../cathen/06357a.htm">Gallican Rite</a> of the thirteenth century. But documentary evidence that the rite was adapted from any one locality is lacking. The chronicles of the order state merely that the rite is neither the pure Roman nor the pure Gallican, but based on the Roman usage of the thirteenth century, with additions from the Rites of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and other places in which the order existed. Just from where these additions were obtained and exactly what they were cannot be determined, except in a general way, from an examination of each distinctive feature.

<p>Two points must be emphasized here: (1) the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Rite is not an arbitrary elaboration of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> made against the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or to give the order an air of exclusiveness, nor can it be said to be more gallicanized then any use of the Gallico-Roman Rite of that period. It was an honest and sincere attempt to harmonize and simplify the widely divergent usages of the early half of the thirteenth century. (2) The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Rite, formulated by Humbert, saw no radical development after its confirmation by <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a>. When <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> made his reform, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Rite had been fixed and stable for over three hundred years, while a constant <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> change had been taking place in other communities. Furthermore the comparative simplicity of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Rite, as manifested in the different <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a>, gives evidence of its antiquity.
<h3 id="D">Liturgical books</h3>

<p>The rite compiled by Humbert contained fourteen books: (1) the Ordinary, which was a sort of an index to the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, the Psalms, Lessons, Antiphons, and Chapters being indicated by their first words. (2) The Martyrology, an amplified calendar of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. (3) The Collectarium, a book for the use of the hebdomidarian, which contained the texts and the notes for the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, chapters, and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>. (4) The Processional, containing the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> (text and music) for the processions. (5) The <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalterium</a>, containing merely the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a>. (6) The Lectionary, which contained the Sunday <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>, the lessons from <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> and the lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. (7) The Antiphonary, giving the text and music for the parts of the Office sung outside of the Mass. (8) The Gradual, which contained the words and the music for the parts of the Mass sung by the choir. (9) The Conventual <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, for the celebration of solemn Mass. (10) The Epistolary, containing the Epistles for the Mass and the Office. (11) The Book of Gospels. (12) The Pulpitary, which contained the musical notation for the Gloria Patri, the Invitatory, Litanies, Tracts, and the <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>. (13) The <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> for a private Mass. (14) The <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, a compilation from all the books used in the choral recitation of the Office, very much reduced in size for the convenience of travellers.

<p>By a process of elimination and synthesis undergone so by the books of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> many of the books of Humbert have become superfluous while several others have been formed. These add nothing to the original text, but merely provide for the Addition of feasts and the more convenient recitation of the office. The collection of the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> now contains: (1) Martyrology; (2) Collectarium; (3) Processional; (4) Antiphonary; (5) Gradual; (6) <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> for the conventual Mass; (7) <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> for the private Mass; (8) <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>; (9) Vesperal; (10) Hor&aelig; Diurn&aelig; (11) Ceremonial. The contents of these books follow closely the books of the same name issued by Humbert and which have just been described. The new ones are: (1) the Hor&aelig; Diurn&aelig; (2) the Vesperal (with notes), adaptations from the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> and the Antiphonary respectively (3) the Collectarium, which is a compilation from all the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> scattered throughout the other books. With the exception of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, these books are similar in arrangement to the correspondingly named books of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> is divided into two parts: Part I, <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> to Trinity; Part II, Trinity to <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a>.
<h3 id="E">Distinctive marks of the Dominican Rite</h3>

<p>Only the most striking differences between the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Rite and the Roman need be mentioned here. The most important is in the manner of celebrating a low <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>. The celebrant in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Rite wears the <a href="../cathen/01428c.htm">amice</a> over his head until the beginning of Mass, and prepares the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> as soon as he reaches the altar. The Psalm "Judica me Deus" is not said and the <a href="../cathen/04222a.htm">Confiteor</a>, much shorter than the Roman, contains the name of St. Dominic. The Gloria and the Credo are begun at the centre of the altar and finished at the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. At the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> there is a simultaneous oblation of the Host and the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and only one <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, the "Suscipe Sancta Trinitas". The Canon of the Mass is the same as the Canon of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, but after it are several noticeable differences. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> celebrant says the "Agnus Dei" immediately after the "Pax Domini" and then recites three <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> "H&aelig;c sacrosancta commixtio" "Domine Jesu Christe", and "Corpus et sanguis" Then follows the Communion, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> receiving the Host from his left hand. No <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are said at the consumption of the Precious Blood, the first <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> after the "Corpus et Sanguis" being the Communion. These are the most noticeable differences in the celebration of a low <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>. In a solemn Mass the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> is prepared just after the celebrant has read the Gospel, seated at the Epistle side of the sanctuary. The <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> is brought from the altar to the place where the celebrant is seated by the sub-deacon, who pours the wine and water into it and replaces it on the altar.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> differs but slightly from the Roman. The Offices celebrated are of seven classes:--of the season (de tempore), of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> (de sanctis), of vigils, of octaves, <a href="../cathen/15510a.htm">votive Offices</a>, Office of the Blessed Virgin, and <a href="../cathen/11220a.htm">Office of the Dead</a>. In point of dignity the feasts are classified as "totum duplex", "duplex" "simplex" "of three lessons", and "of a memory". The ordinary "totum duplex" feast is equivalent to the Roman greater double. A "totum duplex" with an ordinary octave (a simple or a solemn octave) is equal to the second-class double of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, and a "totum duplex" with a most solemn octave is like the Roman first-class double. A "duplex" feast is equivalent to the lesser double and the "simplex" to the semi-double. There is no difference in the ordering of the <a href="../cathen/07500b.htm">canonical hours</a>, except that all during <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Paschal time</a> the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a> provide for only three psalms and three lessons instead of the customary nine psalms and nine lessons. The Office of the Blessed Virgin must be said on all days on which feasts of the rank of duplex or "totum duplex" are not celebrated. The <a href="../cathen/06718a.htm">Gradual psalms</a> must be said on all Saturdays on which is said the <a href="../cathen/15510a.htm">votive Office</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11220a.htm">Office of the Dead</a> must be said once a week except during the week following <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> and the week following Pentecost. Other minor points of difference are the manner of making the commemorations, the text of the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, the Antiphons, the lessons of the common Offices and the insertions of special feasts of the order. There is no great distinction between the musical notation of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Gradual, Vesperal, and Antiphonary and the corresponding books of the new Vatican edition. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> chant has been faithfully copied from the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the thirteenth century, which were in turn derived indirectly from the Gregorian Sacramentary. One is not surprised therefore at the remarkable similarity between the chant of the two rites. For a more detailed study of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Rite reference may be had to the order's <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a>.

<h2>Franciscan Rite</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, unlike the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, and other orders, have never had a peculiar rite properly so called, but, conformably to the mind of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>, have always followed the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> for the celebration of Mass. However, the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> wear the <a href="../cathen/01428c.htm">amice</a>, instead of the <a href="../cathen/02577a.htm">biretta</a>, over the head, and are accustomed to say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> with their feet uncovered, save only by sandals. They also enjoy certain privileges in regard to the time and place of celebrating Mass, and the Missale Romano-Seraphicum contains many proper Masses not found in the Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. These are mostly feasts of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and blessed, which are not celebrated throughout the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or other feasts having a peculiar connexion with the order, e.g. the Feast of the Mysteries of the Way of the Cross (Friday before <a href="../cathen/13721b.htm">Septuagesima</a>), and that of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin (First Sunday after the octave of the Assumption). The same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in regard to the Breviarium Romano-Seraphicum, and Martyrologium Romano-Seraphicum. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> exercised great influence in the origin and evolution of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, and on the revision of the Rubrics of the Mass. They have also their own calendar, or ordo. This calendar may be used not only in the churches of the First Order, but also in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of the Second Order, and <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> Regular (if aggregated to the First Order) and Secular, as well as those religious institutes which have had some connexion with the parent body. It may also be used by <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who are members of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a>. The order has also its own ritual and ceremonial for its receptions, professions, etc.

<h2>Friars Minor Capuchin Rite</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> use the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, except that in the <a href="../cathen/04222a.htm">Confiteor</a> the name of their founder, St. Francis is added after the names of the Apostles, and in the suffrages they make commemorations of St. Francis and all <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of their order. The use of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> in the conventual mass on certain solemnities, even though the Mass is said and not sung, is another <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> custom (recently sanctioned by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>) peculiar to their order. Generally speaking, the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> do not have sung Masses except in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> churches, and except in these churches they may not have organs without the minister general's permission. By a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Sacred Congregation of Rites, 14 May, 1890, the minister general, when celebrating Mass at the time of the <a href="../cathen/15479a.htm">canonical visitation</a> and on solemnities, has the privileges of a domestic <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> of His Holiness. In regard to the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> do not sing it according to note but recite it in monotone. In the larger communities they generally recite <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a> and <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a> at midnight, except on the three last days of <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a>, when Tenebr&aelig; is chanted on the preceding evening, and during the octaves of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> and the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, when <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">matins</a> are recited also on the preceding evening with the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> exposed. Every day after <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Compline</a> they add, extra-liturgically, commemorations of the Immaculate Conception, St. Francis, and <a href="../cathen/01556a.htm">St. Anthony of Padua</a>. On the feast of St. Francis after second <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> they observe the service called the "Transitus" of St. Francis, and on all Saturdays, except feasts of first and second class and certain privileged feri&aelig; and octaves, all Masses said in their churches are votive in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Immaculate Conception, excepting only the conventual mass. They follow the universal calendar, with the addition of feasts proper to their order. These additional feasts include all <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>, all <em>beati</em> of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin Reform</a> and the more notable <em>beati </em>of the whole order; and every year the 5th of October is observed as a commemoration of the departed members of the order in the same way as the 2nd of November is observed in the universal Church. Owing to the great number of feasts thus observed, the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> have the privilege of transferring the greater feasts, when <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, to days marked semi-double. According to the ancient Constitutions of the Order, the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> were not allowed to use vestments of rich texture, not even of silk, but by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Sacred Congregation of Rites, 17 December, 1888, they must now conform to the general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in this matter. They are, however, still <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to maintain severe simplicity in their churches, especially when nonparochial.

<h2>Premonstratensian Rite</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> rite differs from the Roman in the celebration of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, and in the administration of the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>.
<h3 id="A">Sacrifice of the Mass</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> is proper to the order and is not arranged like the Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. The canon is identical, with the exception of a slight variation as to the time of making the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> with the <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a> at the "Libera nos". The music for the Prefaces etc. differs, though not considerably, from that of the Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. Two <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">alleluias</a> are said after the "Ite missa est" for a week after <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>; for the whole of the remaining <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Paschal time</a> one <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">alleluia</a> is said. The rite for the celebration of feasts gives the following grades: three classes of triples, two of doubles, celebre, nine lessons, three lessons. No feasts are celebrated during privileged octaves. There are so many feasts lower than double that usually no privilege is needed for votive Masses. The <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> regulating the various feasts of the year are given in the "Ordinarius Sen. liber c&aelig;remomarum canonici ordinis Pr&aelig;monstratensis". Rubrics for the special <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> functions are found in the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, the Diurnal, the Processional, the Gradual, and the Antiphonary.
<h3 id="B">Divine office</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> differs from the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> in its calendar, the manner of reciting it, arrangement of matter. Some <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> on the Roman calendar are omitted. The feasts peculiar to the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertines</a> are: St. Godfried, C., 16 Jan.; St. Evermodus, B. C., 17 Feb.; Bl. Frederick, Abbot, 3 Mar.; St. Ludolph, B. M., 29 Mar.; Bl. Herman Joseph, C., 7 Apr.; St. Isfrid, B. C., ' 15 June; Sts. Adrian and James, MM., 9 July; Bl. Hrosnata, 19 July, 19; Bl. Gertrude, V., 13 Aug.; Bl. Bronislava, V., 30 Aug.; St. Gilbert, Abbot, 24 Oct.; St. Siardus, Abbot, 17 Nov. The feast of St. Norbert, founder of the order, which falls on 6 June in the Roman calendar, is permanently transferred to 11 July, so that its solemn rite may not be interfered with by the feasts of Pentecost and <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>. Other feasts are the Triumph of St. Norbert over the sacramentarian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Tanchelin, on the third <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> after Pentecost, and the Translation of St. Norbert commemorating the translation of his body from <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> to <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, on the <a href="../cathen/03299a.htm">fourth Sunday after Easter</a>. Besides the daily recitation of the <a href="../cathen/07500b.htm">canonical hours</a> the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertines</a> are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to say the <a href="../cathen/09294a.htm">Little Office of the Blessed Virgin</a>, except on triple feasts and during octaves of the first class. In choir this is said immediately after the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>.
<h3 id="C">Administration of the Sacrament of Penance</h3>

<p>The form of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> is not altogether in harmony with that of the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a>. The following is the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> formula: "Dominus noster Jesus Christus te absolvat, et ego auctoritate ipsius, mihi licet indignissimo concessa, absolvo te in primis, a vinculo excommunicationis ... in quantum possum et indiges", etc.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertines</a> were reprinted by order of the general chapter held at <a href="../cathen/12392a.htm">Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;</a>, in 1738, and presided over by Claude H. Lucas, abbot-general. A new edition of the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> was issued after the General Chapter of Prague, in 1890. In 1902 a committee was appointed to revise the Gradual, Antiphonary, etc. This committee received much encouragement in its work by the Motu Proprio of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> on <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a>. The General Chapter of Tepl, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, in 1908, decided to edit the musical books of the order as prepared, in accordance with ancient <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> by this committee

<h2>Servite Rite</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13736a.htm">Order of Servites</a> (see SERVANTS OF MARY) cannot be said to possess a separate or exclusive rite similar to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and others, but follows the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a>, as provided in its constitutions, with very slight variations. Devotion towards the Mother of Sorrows being the principal distinctive characteristic of the order, there are special <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> attaching to the solemn celebration of the five major Marian feasts, namely, the Annunciation, Visitation, Assumption, Presentation, and Nativity of our Blessed Lady.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the Seven Dolours of the Blessed Virgin Mary, celebrated always on the Third Sunday of September, has a privileged octave and is enriched with a plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> <em>ad instar Portiunculoe</em>; that is, as often as a visit is made to a church of the order. In common with all <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servite</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> wear an <a href="../cathen/01428c.htm">amice</a> on the head instead of a <a href="../cathen/02577a.htm">biretta</a> while proceeding to and from the altar. The Mass is begun with the first part of the <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Angelical Salutation</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/04222a.htm">Confiteor</a> the words <em>Septem beatis patribus nostris </em>are inserted. At the conclusion of Mass the <a href="../cathen/13409a.htm">Salve Regina</a> and the oration <em>Omnipotens sempiterne Deus </em>are recited. In the recitation of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> each canonical hour is begun with the Ave Maria down to the words <em>ventris tui, Jesus. </em>The custom of reciting daily, immediately before <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, a special <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> called <em>Vigilia, </em>composed of the three psalms and three <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a> of the first nocturn of the Office of the Blessed Virgin, followed by three lessons and responses, comes down from the thirteenth century, when they were offered in thanksgiving for a special favour bestowed upon the order by <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Pope Alexander IV</a> (13 May, 1259). The <a href="../cathen/13409a.htm">Salve Regina</a> is daily chanted in choir whether or not it is the antiphon proper to the season.
