<h1>Rites in the United States</h1>  

<p>Since immigration from the eastern portion of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and from <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and Africa set in with such volume, the peoples who (both in union with and outside the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a>) follow the various Eastern rites arrived in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in large numbers, bringing with them their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and their forms of worship. As they grew in number and financial strength, they erected churches in the various cities and towns throughout the country. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> used to be considered the city where the various rites of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> throughout the world could be seen grouped together, but in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> they may be observed to a greater advantage than even in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the various rites are kept alive for the purpose of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educating</a> the various national <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who study there, and for demonstrating the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a>, but there is no body of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> who follow those rites; in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> on the contrary, it is the number and pressure of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> which have caused the establishment and support of the churches of the various rites. There is consequently no better field for studying the various rites of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> than in the chief cities of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, and such study has the advantage to the exact observer of affording an opportunity of comparing the dissident churches of those rites with those which belong to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity. The chief rites which have established themselves in America are these: (1) <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, (2) Greek or Byzantine, and (3) Syro-Maronite. There are also a handful of adherents of the Coptic, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a>, and Chaldean rites, which will also be noticed, and there are occasionally <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the various Latin rites.
<h2 id="section1">The Armenian Rite</h2>

<p>This rite alone, of all the rites in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is confined to one people, one language, and one alphabet. It is, if anything, more exclusive than <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> of old. Other rites are more widely extended in every way: the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> is spread throughout Latin, Teutonic, and <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> peoples, and it even has two languages, the Latin and the Ancient Slavonic, and two alphabets, the Roman and the <a href="../cathen/06575b.htm">Glagolitic</a>, in which its ritual is written; the Greek or Byzantine Rite extends among Greek, <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a>, Latin, and Syrian peoples, and its services are celebrated in Greek, Slavonic, <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumanian</a>, and Arabic with service-books in the Greek, Cyrillic, Latin, and Arabic alphabets. But the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Rite, whether <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or Gregorian, is confined exclusively to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> race, and employs the ancient <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> language and alphabet. The history and origin of the race have been given in the article <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">ARMENIA</a>, but a word may be said of the language (<em>Hayk</em>, as it is called), and its use in the liturgy. The majority of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> were <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by <a href="../cathen/07023a.htm">St. Gregory the Illuminator</a>, a man of noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, who was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> in 302. So thoroughly was his work effected that <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> alone of the ancient nations <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> has preserved no <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> literature antedating the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature of the people; <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> works, if they ever existed, seem to have perished in the ardour of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> thought and expression. The memory of <a href="../cathen/07023a.htm">St. Gregory</a> is so revered that the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> who are opposed to union with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> take <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> in calling themselves "Gregorians," implying that they keep the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> taught by <a href="../cathen/07023a.htm">St. Gregory</a>. Hence it is usual to call the dissidents "Gregorians," in order to distinguish them from the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. At first the language of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Christian liturgy</a> in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> was Syriac, but later they discarded it for their own tongue, and translated all the services into <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, which was at first written in Syriac or Persian letters. About 400 <a href="../cathen/10211a.htm">St. Mesrob</a> invented the present <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> alphabet (except two final letters which were added in the year 1200) and their language, both ancient and modern, has been written in that alphabet ever since. <a href="../cathen/10211a.htm">Mesrob</a> also translated the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> into <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> and revised the entire liturgy. The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> in their church life have led almost as checkered an existence as they have in their national life. At first they were in full communion with the Universal Church. They were bitterly opposed to <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>, and, when in 451 the council of Chalcedon condemned the <a href="../cathen/05633a.htm">doctrine of Eutyches</a>, they seceded, holding the opinion that such a definition was sanctioning <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>, and have since remained separated from and hostile to the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> of Constantinople. In 1054 the Greeks seceded in turn from unity with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, and nearly three centuries later the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> became reconciled with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but the union lasted only a brief period. Breaking away from unity again, the majority formed a national church which agreed neither with the Greek nor the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>; a minority, recruited by converts to union with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in the seventeenth century remained united <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.



<p>The Mass and the whole liturgy of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Church is said in Ancient <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, which differs considerably from the modern tongue. The language is an offshoot of the Iranian branch of the Indo-Germanic <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of languages, and probably found its earliest written expression in the cuneiform inscriptions; it is unlike the <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> languages immediately surrounding it. Among its peculiarities are twelve regular declensions and eight irregular declensions of nouns and five conjugations of the verbs, while there are many difficulties in the way of postpositions and the like. It abounds in consonants and guttural sounds; the words of the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> will suffice as an example: "Hair mier, vor herghins ies, surp iegitzi anun ko, ieghastze arkautiun ko, iegitzin garnk ko, vorbes hierghins iev hergri, zhatz mier hanabazort dur miez aissor, iev tog miez ezbardis mier, vorbes iev mek togumk merotz bardabanatz, iev mi danir zmez i porsutiun, ail perghea i chare." The language is written from left to right, like Greek, Latin or English, but in an alphabet of thirty-eight peculiar letters which are dissimilar in form to anything in the Greek or Latin alphabet, and are arranged in a most perplexing order. For instance, the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> alphabet starts off with <em>a, p, k, t, z</em>, etc., and ends up with the letter <em>f</em>. It may also be noted that the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> has changed the consonantal values of most of the ordinary sounds in <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">Christian names</a>; thus George becomes Kevork; Sergius, Sarkis; Jacob, Hagop; Joseph, Hovsep; Gregory, Krikori; Peter, Bedros; and so on. The usual clan addition of the word "son" (ian) to most <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> names, something like the use of mac in the Gaelic languages, renders usual <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> names easy of identification (e.g., Azarian, Hagopian, Rubian, Zohrabian, etc.).

<p>The book containing the regulations for the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, analogous to the Greek Euchologion or the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a>, is called the "Mashdotz," after the name of its compiler <a href="../cathen/10211a.htm">St. Mesrob</a>, who was surnamed Mashdotz. He arranged and compiled the five great <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> used in the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Church: (1) the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> (Zhamakirk) or Book of Hours; (2) The Directory (Tzutzak) or Calendar, containing the fixed festivals of the year; (3) The Liturgy (Pataragakirk) or <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, arranged and enriched also by John Mantaguni; (4) The Book of Hymns (Dagaran), arranged for the principal great feasts of the year; (5) The Ritual or "Mashdotz," mentioned above. A peculiarity about the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Church is that the majority of great feasts falling upon weekdays are celebrated on the Sunday immediately following. The great festivals of the <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">Christian year</a> are divided by the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> into five classes: (1) <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>; (2) feasts which fall on Sunday such as <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a>, Pentecost, etc.; (3) feasts which are observed on the days on which they occur: the Nativity, Epiphany, Circumcision, Presentation, and Annunciation; (4) feasts which are transferred to the following Sunday: Transfiguration, Immaculate Conception, Nativity B.V.M., Assumption, Holy Cross, feasts of the Apostles, etc.; (5) other feasts, which are not observed at all unless they can be transferred to Sunday. The Gregorian <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> observe the Nativity, Epiphany, and Baptism of Our Lord on the same day (6 January), but the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> observe <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> on 25 December and the Epiphany on 6 January, and they observe many of the other feasts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> on the days on which they actually fall. The principal <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> are: (1) <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>; (2) the Fast of Nineveh for two weeks, one month before the commencement of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> &#151; in reality a remnant of the ancient <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> fast, now commemorated only in name by our <a href="../cathen/13721b.htm">Septuagesima</a>, <a href="../cathen/13747a.htm">Sexagesima</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12614a.htm">Quinquagesima</a> <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>; (3) the week following Pentecost. The days of abstinence are the Wednesdays and Fridays throughout the year with certain exceptions (e.g., during the week after the Nativity, <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, and the Assumption). In the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Church Saturday is observed as the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, commemorating the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> and the creation of man, and Sunday, as the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Lord's Day</a> of <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> and rejoicing, commemorating the New Law and the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of man. Most of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints'</a> days are dedicated to <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> not commemorated in other lands but the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in Galicia and <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a> use the Gregorian (not the Julian) Calendar and have many Roman <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints'</a> days and feasts added to their ancient <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> year.

<p>In the actual arrangement of the church building for worship the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Rite differs both from the Greek and the Latin. While the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Church was in communion with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, it seems to have united many Roman practices in its ritual with those that were in accord with the Greek or Byzantine forms. The church building may be divided into the sanctuary and church proper (choir and <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>.) The sanctuary is a platform raised above the general level of the church and reached by four or more steps. The altar is always erected in the middle of it and it is again a few steps higher than the level of &amp; sanctuary. It is perhaps possible that the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> originally used an altar-screen or iconostasis, like that of the Greek churches, but it has long since disappeared. Still they do not use the open altar like the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>. Two curtains are hung before the sanctuary: a large double curtain hangs before its entrance, extending completely across the space like the Roman <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a> rail, and is so drawn as to conceal the altar, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> at certain parts of the Mass; the second and smaller curtain is used merely to separate the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and to cover the altar after service. Each curtain opens on both sides, and ordinarily is drawn back from the middle. The second curtain is not much used. The use of these curtains is ascribed to the year 340, when they were required by a canon formulated by Bishop Macarius of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Upon the altar are usually the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, the Book of Gospels, a cross upon which the image of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> is <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> or engraved in low relief, and two or more candles, which are lighted as in the Roman use. The <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is usually reserved in a tabernacle on the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>, and a small lamp kept burning there at all times. In the choir, usually enclosed within a low iron railing, the singers and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> stand in lines while singing or reciting the Office. In the East, the worshipper, upon entering the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> of the church, usually takes off his shoes, just as the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> do, for the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> founds this practice upon <a href="../bible/exo003.htm#vrs5">Exodus 3:5</a>; this custom is not followed in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> nor do the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> there sit cross-legged upon the floor in their churches, as they do in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>.

<p>The administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is marked by some ceremonies unlike those of the Roman or Greek Churches, and by some which are a composite of the two. In the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Sacrament of Baptism</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> meets the child carried in the arms of the nurse at the church door, and, while reciting Psalms li and cxxx, takes two threads (one white and the other red) and twists them into a cord, which he afterwards <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesses</a>. Usually the godfather goes to confession before the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, in order that he may fulfil his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> in the state of grace. The <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcisms</a> and renunciations then take place, and the recital of the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a> and the answers to the responses follow. The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> water is blessed, the anointing with oil performed, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> are said, and then the child is stripped. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> takes the child and holds it in the font so that the body is in the water, but the head is out, and the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> takes place in this manner: "N., the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> coming into the state of a <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a> and thence to that of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, is now <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by me, in the name of the Father [here he pours a handful of water on the head of the child], and of the Son [here he pours water as before], and of the Holy Ghost [here he pours a third handful]." After this the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> dips the child thrice under the water, saying on each occasion: "Thou art redeemed by the blood of Christ from the bondage of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by receiving the liberty of sonship of the Heavenly Father, and becoming a co-heir with Christ and a <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of the Holy Ghost. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>." Then the child is washed and clothed again, generally with a new and beautiful robe, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> when washing the child says: "Ye that were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in Christ, have put on Christ, <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>. And ye that have been illumined by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a>, may the Holy Ghost rejoice in you. <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>." Then the passage of the Gospel of St. Matthew relating the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ in the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> is read, and the rite thus completed.

<p>The Sacrament of Confirmation is conferred by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> immediately after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, although the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> sometimes reserve it for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">holy chrism</a> is applied by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to the forehead, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, palms, heart, spine, and feet, each time with a reference to the seal of the Spirit. Finally, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> lays his hand upon and makes the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> on the child's forehead saying: "Peace to thee, saved through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." When the confirmation is thus finished, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> binds the child's forehead with the red and white string which he twisted at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and fastens it at the end with a small cross. He gives two candles, one red and one green, to the godfather and has the child brought up to the altar where Communion is given to it by a small drop of the Sacred Blood, or, if it be not at the time of Mass, by taking the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> from the Tabernacle and signing the mouth of the child with it in the form of the cross, saying in either case: "The plenitude of the Holy Ghost"; if the candidate be an adult, full Communion is administered, and there the confirmation is ended.

<p>The formula of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a> is: "May the merciful <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> have mercy upon you and grant you the pardon of all your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, both confessed and forgotten; and I by virtue of my order of <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and in force of the power granted by the Divine Command: Whosesoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you remit on earth they are remitted unto them in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; through that same word I absolve you from all participation in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by thought, word and deed, in the name of the Father, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And I again restore you to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the Holy Church; whatsoever good you shall do, shall be counted to you for merit and for glory in the life to come. May the shedding of the blood of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, which He shed upon the cross and which delivered <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, deliver you from your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>." As a rule <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> are exhorted to make their confession and communion on at least five days in the year: the so-called <em>Daghavork</em> or feasts of Tabernacles, i.e., the Epiphany, <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, Transfiguration, Assumption, and Exaltation of the Holy Cross. The first two festivals are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> and, if an <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> neglects his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, he incurs <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>.

<p>The Sacrament of Extreme Unction (or "Unction with Oil," as it is called) is supposed to be administered by seven <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the ancient form, but practically it is performed by a single <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on most occasions. The eyes, ears, nose, lips, hands, feet, and heart of the sick man are anointed, with this form: "I anoint thine eyes with holy oil, so that whatever sin thou mayst have committed through thy sight, thou mayst be saved therefrom by the anointing of this oil, through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ", and with a similar reference to the other members anointed.

<p>The Divine Liturgy or Mass is of course the chief rite among the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or Gregorian, and it is celebrated with a form and ceremonial which partakes in a measure both of the Roman and Byzantine rites. As we have said, the curtains are used instead of the altar-rail or iconostasis of those rites, and the vestments are also peculiar. The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, like the Latins, use unleavened bread, in the form of a wafer or small thin round cake, for <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>; but like the Greeks they prepare many wafers, and those not used for <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> in the Mass are given afterwards to the people as the antidoron. The wine used must be solely the fermented juice of the best grapes obtainable. In the Gregorian churches Communion is given to the people under both species, the Host being dipped in the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> before delivering it to the communicant, but in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches Communion is now given only in one species, that of the Body, although there is no express prohibition against the older form. On <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Eve</a> and <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Easter Eve</a> the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> celebrate <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in the evening; the Mass then begins with the curtains drawn whilst the introductory psalms and prophecies are sung, but, at the moment the great feast is announced in the <a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a>, the curtains are withdrawn and the altar appears with full illumination. During <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> the altar remains entirely hidden by the great curtains, and during all the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, except <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a>, Mass is celebrated behind the drawn curtains. A relic of this practice still remains in the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, as shown by the veiling of the images and pictures from <a href="../cathen/11535a.htm">Passion Sunday</a> till <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Easter Eve</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> vestments for Mass are peculiar and splendid. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> wears a crown, exactly in the form of a Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>, which is called the <em>Saghavard</em> or helmet. This is also worn by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> attending on a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at <a href="../cathen/12232a.htm">pontifical Mass</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> wear a <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> almost identical in shape with the Latin <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>, and said to have been introduced at the time of the union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the twelfth century, when they relinquished the Greek form of <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to wear in the Mass. The celebrant is first vested with the <em>shapik</em> or <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>, which is usually narrower than the Latin form, and usually of linen (sometimes of silk). He then puts on each of his arms the <em>bazpans</em> or cuffs, which replace the <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">Latin maniple</a>; then the <em>ourar</em> or stole, which is in one piece; then the <em>goti</em> or girdle, then the <em>varkas</em> or amict, which is a large <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidered</a> stiff collar with a shoulder covering to it; and finally the <em>shoochar</em>, or <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a>, which is almost exactly like a Roman cope. If the celebrant be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he also wears the <em>gonker</em> or Greek epigonation. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> carry a staff shaped like the Latin, while the <em>vartabeds</em> (deans, or <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of divinity; analogous to the Roman mitred <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>) carry a staff in the Greek form (a staff with two intertwined serpents). No organs are used in the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> church, but the elaborate vocal music of the Eastern style, sung by choir and people, is accompanied by two metallic instruments, the <em>keshotz</em> and <em>zinzqha</em> (the first a fan with small bells; the second similar to cymbals), both of which are used during various parts of the Mass. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> wears merely an <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>, and a stole in the same manner as in the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> and lower <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> wear simply the <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Mass may be divided into three parts: Preparation, <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> or Canon, and Conclusion. The first and preparatory portion extends as far as the Preface, when the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> are directed by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> to leave. The Canon commences with the conclusion of the Preface and ends with the Communion. As soon as the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is robed in his vestments he goes to the altar, washes his hands reciting Psalm xxvi, and then going to the foot of the altar begins the Mass. After saying the Intercessory <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04222a.htm">Confiteor</a> and the Absolution, which is given with a crucifix in hand, he recites Psalm xlii (Introibo ad altare), and at every two verses ascends a step of the altar. After he has intoned the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> "In the tabernacle of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>," the curtains are drawn, and the choir sings the appropriate <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> of the day. Meanwhile the celebrant behind the curtain prepares the bread on the <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a> and fills the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, ready for the oblation. When this is done the curtains are withdrawn and the altar <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensed</a>. Then the <a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a> of the day is sung, then the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> corresponding to those of the first, second, and third <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a> of the Byzantine Rite, while the proper psalms are sung by the choir. Then the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> intones "Proschume" (let us attend), and elevates the book of the gospels, which is <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensed</a> as he brings it to the altar, making the Little Entrance. The choir then sings the Trisagion (<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Holy God</a>, Holy and Mighty, Holy and Immortal, have mercy on us) thrice. The Gregorians interpolate after "Holy and Immortal" some words descriptive of the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a>, such as "who was made manifest for us," or "who didst rise from the dead," but this addition has been condemned at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as being a relic of the Patripassian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. During the Trisagion the <em>Keshotz</em> is jingled in accompaniment. Then the Greek Ektene or Litany is sung, and at its conclusion the reader reads the Prophecy; then the Antiphon before the Epistle is sung, and the epistle of the day read. At the end of each the choir responds <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>. Then the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> announces "Orthi" (stand up) and, taking the Gospels, reads or intones the gospel of the day. Immediately afterwards, the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> form of the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a> is said or sung. It differs from the creed as said in the Roman and Greek Churches in that it has, "consubstantial with the Father by whom all things were made <em>in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> and in Earth, visible and invisible</em>; who for us men and our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> came down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, was incarnate and was made man <em>and perfectly begotten</em> through the Holy Ghost of the most Holy Virgin Mary; <em>he assumed from her body, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and mind, and all that in man is, truly and not figuratively</em>;" and "we believe also in the Holy Ghost, <em>not created, all perfect</em>, who proceedeth from the Father (and the Son), <em>who spake in the Law, in the Prophets and the Holy Gospel, who descended into the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, who preached Him who was sent, and who dwelt in the Saints</em>," and after concluding in the ordinary form adds the sentence pronounced by the First Council of Nicaea: "Those who say there was a time when the Son was not, or when the Holy Ghost was not; or that they were created out of nothing; or that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and the Holy Ghost are of another substance or that they are mutable; the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic church condemns." Then the Confession of St. Gregory is intoned aloud, and the Little Ektene sung. The <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a> is here given to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> at its close dismisses the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, and the choir sings the Hymn of the Great Entrance, when the <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> are solemnly brought to the altar. "The Body of our Lord and the Blood of our Redeemer are to be before us. The Heavenly Powers invisible sing and proclaim with uninterrupted voice, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">Hosts</a>."

<p>Here the curtains are drawn, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> takes off his crown (or the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> his <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>). The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incenses</a> the holy gifts and again washes his bands, repeating Psalm xxvi as before. After the Salutation is sung, the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> are dismissed, and the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> or Canon begins. The Preface is said secretly, only the concluding part being intoned to which the choir responds with the Sanctus. The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> before <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> follows, with a comparison of the Old and the New Law, not found in either Greek or <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>: "Holy, Holy, Holy; Thou art in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> most Holy; who is there who can dare to describe by words thy bounties which flow down upon us without measure? For Thou didst protect and console our forefathers, when they had fallen in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by means of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, the Law, the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and the offering of bullocks, showing forth that which was to come. And when at length He came, Thou didst tear in pieces the register of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and didst bestow on us Thine Only Begotten Son, the debtor and the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>, the victim and the anointed, the Lamb and Bread of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, the Priest and the Oblation for He is the distributor and is always distributed amongst us, without being exhausted. Being made man truly and not apparently, and by union without confusion, He was incarnate in the womb of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary, Mother of God</a>, and journeyed through all the passions of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> only excepted, and of His own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> walked to the cross, whereby He gave life to the world and wrought <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for us." Then follow the actual words of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, which are intoned aloud. Then follow the Offering and the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a>, which differs slightly, in the Gregorian and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> form; the Gregorian is: "whereby Thou wilt make the bread when blessed truly the body of our Lord and Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>;" and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> form: "whereby Thou hast made the bread when blessed truly the Body of our Lord and Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>." As there is actually no blessing or <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> after the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> form represents the correct <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. Then come the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the living and the dead, and an intoning by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> of the Commemoration of the Saints, in which nearly all the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are mentioned. Then the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> intones aloud the Ascription of Praise of Bishop Chosroes the Great in thanksgiving for the Sacrament of the Altar. After this comes a long Ektene or Litany, and then the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Our Father</a> is sung by the choir. The celebrant then elevates the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Host, saying "Holy things for Holy Persons," and when the choir responds, he continues: "Let us taste in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> the holy and honourable Body and Blood of our Lord and Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> who came down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and is now distributed among us." Then the choir sings <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the sacrifice of the Body and Blood, and the small curtain is drawn. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kisses</a> the sacred Victim, saying "I confess and I believe that Thou art Christ, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who has borne the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the world." The Host is divided into three parts, one of which is placed in the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>. The choir sing the communion <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> as appointed; the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> receive the Communion first, and then the choir and people. The little curtain is withdrawn when the Communion is given, and the great curtains are drawn back when the people come up for Communion.

<p>After Communion, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> puts on his crown (or the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> his <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>), and the great curtains are again drawn. Thanksgiving <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are said behind them, after which the great curtains are withdrawn once more, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> holding the book of gospels says the great <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of peace, and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesses</a> the people. Then the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> proclaims "Orthi" (stand up) and the celebrant reads the Last Gospel, which is nearly always invariable, being the Gospel of St. John, i, 1 sqq.: "In the beginning was the Word, etc."; the only exception is from <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> to the eve of Pentecost, when they use the Gospel of St. John, xxi, 15-20: "So when they had dined, etc." Then the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for peace and the "Kyrie Eleison" (thrice) are said, the final benediction is given, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> retires from the altar. Whilst Psalm xxxiv is recited or sung by the people, the blessed bread is distributed. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> confine this latter rite to high festivals only. The chief editions of the Gregorian <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Missals are those printed at Constantinople (1823, 1844), <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (1841, 1873, and 1884), and Etschmiadzin (1873); the chief <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> editions are those of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> (1808, 1874, 1895), Trieste (1808), and <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1858, 1884).
<h3>Armenian Catholics</h3>

<p>Armenians had come to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in small numbers prior to 1895. In that and the following year the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> massacres took place throughout <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> and <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, and large numbers of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to America. Among them were many <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, although these were not sufficiently numerous to organize any <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities like their Gregorian brethren. In 1898 Msgr. Stephan Azarian (Stephen X), then <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Cilicia of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, who resided in Constantinople, entered into negotiations with <a href="../cathen/09111b.htm">Cardinal Ledochowski</a>, Prefect of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of the Propaganda</a>, and through him obtained the consent of <a href="../cathen/04395a.htm">Archbishop Corrigan</a> of New York and Archbishop Williams of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Rite to labour in their respective provinces for the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who had come to this country. He sent as the first <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> missionary the Very Reverend Archpriest Mardiros Mighirian, who had been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> College, and arrived in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> on <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">Ascension Day</a>, 11 May, 1899. He at first went to <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> where he assembled a small congregation of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and later proceeded to New York to look after the spiritual welfare of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> in Manhattan and <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>. He also established a mission station in <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>. In New York and Brooklyn the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Rite are divided into those who speak <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> and those who, coming from places outside of the historic <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, speak the Arabic language. At present this missionary is stationed at St. Stephen's church in East Twenty-eighth Street, since large numbers of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> live in that vicinity, but has another congregation under his charge in <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>. All these <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> are too <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> to build any church or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of their own, and use the basement portion of the Latin churches. Towards the end of 1906 another <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Rev. Manuel Basieganian, commenced mission work in Paterson, <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">New Jersey</a>, and now attends mission stations throughout New England, <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">New Jersey</a>, and Eastern <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. In 1908 Rev. Hovsep (Joseph) Keossajian settled in Lawrence, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, and established a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in St. Mary's Church. He also <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> to the spiritual wants of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> at <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>, East Watertown, Newton, Lynn, Chelsea, and Lowell. In 1909 Rev. Moses Mazarian took charge of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> mission at <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, and in the cities throughout the west. None of these have been able to build independent <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> churches, but usually hold their services in the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> churches. Besides the places already mentioned there are slender <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> congregations at Haverhill, <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, Fitchburg, Milford, <a href="../cathen/05771a.htm">Fall River</a>, Holyoke, and Whiting, in <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>; Nashua and Manchester, <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>; Providence, Pawtucket, and Central Falls in <a href="../cathen/13020a.htm">Rhode Island</a>; New Britain and Bridgeport, in <a href="../cathen/04253b.htm">Connecticut</a>; Jersey City, West Hoboken, and Newark, in New Jersey; and Philadelphia and <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>. The number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> is very small, being estimated at about 2000 to 2500 all told. So many of them reside among the other <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> and frequent their churches, that there may be more who do not profess themselves <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and purely <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> would doubtless bring to light many whom the mission <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> on their rounds do not reach.
<h3>Gregorian Armenians</h3>

<p>Inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> was <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/07023a.htm">St. Gregory the Illuminator</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> who are not in union with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> themselves upon the fact that they more truly hold the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> preached by <a href="../cathen/07023a.htm">St. Gregory</a> and they are accordingly called <em>Gregorians</em>, since the word "Orthodox" would be likely to confuse them with the Greeks. By reason of the many <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> founded in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> and in Constantinople by American <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> missionaries, their attention was turned to America, and, when the massacres of 1895-96 took place, large numbers came to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Many of them belonged to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Church, and identified themselves with the <a href="../cathen/04239a.htm">Congregationalists</a> or <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterians</a>; but the greater number of them belonged to the national Gregorian Church. In 1889 Rev. Hovsep Sarajian, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> from Constantinople, was sent to the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> in <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, and a church which was built in <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> in 1891, is still the headquarters of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Church in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The emigration increasing greatly after the massacres, Father Sarajian was reinforced by several other <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> priests; in 1898 he was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and in 1903 was invested with <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> authority, having <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> under his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Seven great pastorates were organized to serve as the nuclei of future <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>: at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, and Lawrence (Massachusetts), New York, Providence (Rhode Island), Fresno (California), and <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> (Illinois). To these was added West Hoboken in 1906. There are numerous congregations and mission stations in various cities. Churches have been built in <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, Fresno, and West Hoboken; in <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> and Providence halls are rented, and in other places arrangements are often made with Episcopal churches where their services are held. The Gregorian <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> comprises the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, seven resident and three missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, while the number of Gregorian <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> is given at 20,000 in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. There are several <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> and two <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> newspapers, and also <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> reading-rooms in several places.
<h2 id="section2">Byzantine or Greek Rite</h2>

<p>This rite, reckoning both the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Schismatic Churches, comes next in expansion through the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>. It also ranks next to the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> in America, there being now (1911) about 156 Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches, and about 149 Greek Orthodox churches in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Eastern Orthodox</a> Churches of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkey</a>, <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumania</a>, <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, and other places where they are found, make up a total of about 120,000,000, while the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat Churches</a> of the same rite, the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, and elsewhere, amount to upwards of 7,500,000. The Byzantine Rite has already been fully described [see <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">THE RITE OF CONSTANTINOPLE</a>; <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">GREEK RITES</a>; <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">ORTHODOX CHURCH</a>; <a href="../cathen/01359b.htm">ALTAR (IN THE GREEK CHURCH)</a>; <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">ARCHIMANDRITE</a>; <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">EPIKLESIS</a>; <a href="../cathen/05595b.htm">EUCHOLOGION</a>; <a href="../cathen/07626a.htm">ICONOSTASIS</a>], as well as the organization and development of the various churches using the Greek or Byzantine Rite (see <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">EASTERN CHURCHES</a>; <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">GREEK CHURCH</a>; <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">RUSSIA</a>). Unlike the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Rite, it has not been confined to any particular people or language, but has spread over the entire <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Christian Orient</a> among the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a>, Rumanian and Greek populations. As regards <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and authority, it has not been united and homogeneous like the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, nor has it, like the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, been uniform in language, calendar, or particular customs, although the same general teaching, ritual, and observances have been followed. The principal languages in which the liturgy of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> is celebrated are: (1) Greek; (2) Slavonic; (3) Arabic, and (4) Rumanian. It is also celebrated in Georgian by a small and diminishing number of worshippers, and sometimes experimentally in a number of modern tongues for missionary purposes; but as this latter use has never been approved, the four languages named above may be considered the official ones of the Byzantine Rite. A portion of the population of all the nations which use this rite, follow it in union with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and these have by their union placed the Byzantine Rite in the position which it occupied before the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of 1054. Thus, the Russians, <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a>, who are <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a>, use the Old Slavonic in their church books and services; so likewise do the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a>. Likewise the Rumanians of Rumania and <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>, who are <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a>, use the Rumanian language in the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>; but the Rumanians of <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>, who are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, do the same. The Orthodox Greeks of <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> and Turkey use the original Greek of their rite; but the <a href="../cathen/08206a.htm">Italo-Greeks</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and the Greeks of Constantinople, who are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, use it also. The Syro-Arabians of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, who are <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a>, use the Arabic in the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a> likewise use it.

<p>The numerous emigrants from these countries to America have brought with them their Byzantine Rite with all its local peculiarities and its language. In some respects the environment of all people professing the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> in union with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> but in close touch with their countrymen of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> has tended to change in unimportant particulars several of the ceremonies and sometimes particular phrases of the rite (see <a href="../cathen/08206a.htm">ITALO-GREEKS</a>; <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">MELCHITES</a>; <a href="../cathen/13277a.htm">RUTHENIAN RITE</a>), but not to a greater extent than the various Schismatic Churches have changed the language and ceremonies in their several national Churches. Where this has occurred in the Greek Churches united with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, it has been fiercely denounced as latinizing; but, where it has occurred in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, or <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, it is merely regarded by the same denouncers as a mere expression of nationalism. There is in the aggregate a larger number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the Byzantine Rite in America than of the Orthodox. The chief nationalities there which are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> are the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, Rumanians, <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a>, and Italo-Greek; the principal Orthodox ones are the Russians, Greeks, Syro-Arabians, <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a>, Rumanians, <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01253b.htm">Albanians</a>. The history and establishment of each of these has been already given (see <a href="../cathen/06744a.htm">GREEK CATHOLICS IN AMERICA</a>; <a href="../cathen/06772a.htm">GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH IN AMERICA</a>). As emigration from those lands increases daily, and the representatives of those rites are increasing in numbers and prosperity, a still wider expansion of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> may be expected. Already the Russian <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> has a strong <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, an <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, supported chiefly by the <a href="../cathen/07428a.htm">Holy Synod</a> and the Orthodox Missionary Society of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and much proselytizing is carried on among the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The latter are not in such a favourable position; they have no home governmental support, but have had to build and equip their own institutions out of their own slender means. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> has provided a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for them, but the Russians have stirred up dissensions and made his position as difficult as possible among his own people. The Hellenic Greek <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> expects soon to have its own Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and the Serbians and Rumanians also expect a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to be appointed by their home authorities.
<h2 id="section3">Maronite Rite</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> is one of the Syrian rites and has been closely assimilated in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> (see <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">MARONITES</a>). Unlike the Syro-Chaldean or the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Syro-Catholic</a> rites, for they all use the Syriac language in the Mass and liturgy, it has not kept the old forms intact, but has modelled itself more and more upon the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>. Among all the Eastern rites which are now in communion with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, it alone has no Schismatic rite of corresponding form and language, but is wholly united and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, thereby differing also from the other Syrian rites. The <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language is the ancient Syriac or Aramaic, and the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a>, as well as all other rites who use Syriac, take especial <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> in the fact that they celebrate the Mass in the very language which Christ spoke while He was on earth, as evidenced by some fragments of His very words still preserved in the Greek text of the Gospels (e.g., in <a href="../bible/mat027.htm#vrs46">Matthew 27:46</a> and <a href="../bible/mar005.htm#vrs41">Mark 5:41</a>). The Syriac is a <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> language closely related to the Hebrew, and is sometimes called Aramaic from the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> Aram (Northern <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>). As the use of Ancient Hebrew died out after the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> captivity, the Syriac or Aramaic took its place, very much as Italian has supplanted Latin throughout the Italian peninsula. This was substantially the situation at the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> teaching and the foundation of the early Church. Syriac is now a dead language, and in the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> service and liturgy bears the same relation to the vernacular Arabic as the Latin in the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> does to the modern languages of the people. It is written with a peculiar alphabet, reads from right to left like the Hebrew or Arabic languages, but its letters are unlike the current alphabets of either of these languages. To simplify the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> Missals, <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, and other service books, the vernacular Arabic is often employed for the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> and for many of the best-known <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>; it is written, not in Arabic characters, but in Syriac, and this mingled language and alphabet is called <em>Karshuni</em>. The Epistle, Gospel, Creed and <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Pater Noster</a> are nearly always given in Karshuni, instead of the original Arabic.

<p>The form of the Liturgy or Mass is that of St. James, so called because of the tradition that it originated with <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">St. James the Less</a>, Apostle and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. It is the type form of the Syriac Rite, but the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> Use has accommodated it more and more to the Roman. This form of the Liturgy of St. James constitutes the Ordinary of the Mass, which is always said in the same manner, merely changing the epistles and gospels according to the <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">Christian year</a>. But the Syrians, whether of the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a>, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a>, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, or Syro-Chaldaic rite, have the peculiarity (not found in other <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>) of inserting different <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">anaphoras</a> or canons of the Mass, composed at various times by different Syrian <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; these change according to the feast celebrated, somewhat analogously to the Preface in the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>. The principal <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">anaphoras</a> or canons of the Mass used by the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a> are: (1) the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> according to the Order of the Holy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, the Mother of all the Churches; (2) the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> of St. Peter, the Head of the Apostles; (3) the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve Apostles</a>; (4) the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> of St. James the Apostle, brother of the Lord, (5) the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John the Apostle and Evangelist</a>; (6) the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> of St. Mark the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a>; (7) the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> of <a href="../cathen/14031b.htm">St. Xystus, the Pope of Rome</a>; (8) the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> of St. John surnamed Maro, from whom they derive their name; (9) the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>; (10) the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>; (11) the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> of St. Cyril; (12) the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> of St. Dionysius; (13) the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> of John of Harran, and (14) the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> of Marutha of Tagrith. Besides these they have also a form of liturgy of the Presanctified for <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>, after the Roman custom. Frequent use of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> is a noticeable feature of the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> Mass, and not even in low <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> is the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> omitted. In their form of church building the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a> have nothing special like the Greeks with their iconostasis and square altar, or the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> with their curtains, but build their churches very much as Latins do. While the <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">sacred vestments</a> are hardly distinguishable from those of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, in some respects they approach the Greek form. The <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>, the girdle, and the <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniple</a> or cuffs on each hand, a peculiar form of amict, the <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a> (sometimes in Greek and sometimes in Roman form), and the ordinary Roman <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a> make up the vestments worn by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at Mass. Bishops use a cross, <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>, and staff of the Roman form. The <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> used on the altar are the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a> or disk, and a small star or <a href="../cathen/02017a.htm">asterisk</a> to cover the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Host. They, like us, use a small cross or crucifix, with a long silken banneret attached, for giving the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a> use unleavened bread and have a round host, as in the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> Mass commences with the ablution and vesting at the foot of the altar. Then, standing at the middle of the sanctuary, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> recites Psalm xlii, "Introibo ad altare," moving his head in the form of a cross. He then ascends the altar, takes the <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censer</a> and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incenses</a> both the uncovered <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a>, then takes up the Host and has it <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensed</a>, puts it on the <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a> and has the <a href="../cathen/04386c.htm">corporals</a> and veils <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensed</a>. He next pours wine in the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, adding a little water, and then <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incenses</a> it and covers both host and <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> with the proper veils. Then, going again to the foot of the altar, he says aloud the first <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in Arabic, which is followed by an antiphon. The strange Eastern music, with its harsh sounds and quick changes, is a marked feature of the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite Rite</a>. The altar, the elements, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, servers, and people are <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensed</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08714a.htm">Kyrie Eleison</a> (Kurrilison) and the "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Holy God</a>, Holy strong one, etc." are sung by choir and people. Then comes the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Pater Noster</a> in Arabic, with the response: "For thine is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a> and the power and the glory, world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>." The celebrant and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> intone the Synapte for peace, which is followed by a short form of the Gloria in excelsis: "Glory be to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on high, and on earth peace and good hope to the sons of men, etc." The <em>Phrumiur</em> is then said; this is an introductory <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and always comes before the <em>Sedro</em>, which is a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of praise said aloud by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> standing before the altar while the <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censer</a> is swung. It is constructed by the insertion of verses into a more or less constant framework, commemorative of the feast or season, and seems to be a survival of the old psalm verses with the Gloria. For instance, a <em>sedro</em> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> will commemorate her in many ways, something like our <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a>, but more poetically and at length; one of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> will celebrate Him in His nativity, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, etc. Then come the commemorations of the Prophets, the Apostles, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, of all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and lastly the commemoration of the departed: "Be ye not sad, all ye who sleep in the dust, and in the decay of your bodies. The living Body which you have eaten and the saving Blood which you have drunk, can again vivify all of you, and clothe your bodies with glory. O Christ, Who hast come and given peace by Thy Blood to the heights and the depths, give rest to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of Thy servants in the promised life everlasting!" The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> then <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for the living, and makes special <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a> by name of those living or dead for whom the Mass is offered. He <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesses</a> and offers the sacred elements, in a form somewhat analogous to the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>. Another <em>phrumiun</em> and the great <em>Sedro</em> of <a href="../cathen/05498a.htm">St. Ephraem</a> or St. James is said, in which the whole <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacrifice of the Mass</a> is foreshadowed. The psalm preparatory to the Epistle in Arabic is recited, and the epistle of the day then read. The <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a> and <a href="../cathen/06718a.htm">gradual psalm</a> is recited, the Book of Gospels <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensed</a>, and the Gospel, also in Arabic, intoned or read. The versicles of thanksgiving for the Gospel are intoned, at several parts of which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/12372a.htm">precentor</a> chant in unison. The <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a>, said in unison by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, follows, and immediately after the celebrant washes his hands saying Psalm xxvi. This ends the Ordinary of the Mass.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a>, or <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">Canon of the Mass</a>, is then begun, and varies according to season, place, and celebrant. In the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> of the Holy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, which is a typical one, the Mass proceeds with the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for peace very much as they stand at the end of the Roman Mass; then follow <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of confession, adoration, and glory, which conclude by giving the <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The Preface follows: "Let us lift up our thoughts, our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and our hearts! Response. They are lifted up to Thee, O Lord! Priest. Let us give thanks to the Lord in fear, and adore Him with trembling. R. It is meet and just. P. To Thee, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, O glorious and holy King of Israel, for ever! R. Glory be to the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, now and forever, world without end. P. Before the glorious and divine mysteries of our Redeemer, with the pleasant things which are imposed, let us implore the mercy of the Lord! R. It is meet and just" (and the Preface continues secretly). Then the Sanctus is sung, and the Consecration immediately follows. The words of Consecration are intoned aloud, the choir answering "Amen." After the succeeding <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of commemoration of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> and hope of the Second Coming and a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for mercy, the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> is said: "How tremendous is this hour and how awful this moment, my beloved, in which the Holy and Life-giving Spirit comes down from on high and descends upon this Eucharist which is placed in this sanctuary for our reconciliation. With silence and fear stand and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>! Salvation to us and the peace of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father of all of us. Let us cry out and say thrice: Have mercy on us, O Lord, and send down the Holy and Life-giving Spirit upon us! Hear me, O Lord! And let Thy living and it descend upon me and upon this sacrifice! And so complete this mystery, that it be the Body of Christ our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for our <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>!" The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the Pope of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and all the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> professors and believers of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> immediately follow. This in turn is followed by a long <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> for tranquillity, peace, and the commemoration of all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the early Church and of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, including St. John Maro, with the petition for the dead at the end. Then comes the solemn offering of the Body and the Blood for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and people, concluding with the words: "Thy Body and Thy Holy Blood are the way which leads to the Kingdom!" The adoration and the fraction follow; then the celebrant elevates the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> together with the Host, and says: "O desirable sacrifice which is offered for us! O victim of reconciliation, which the Father obtained in Thy own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>! O Lamb, Who wast the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> as the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">High Priest</a> who sacrificed!" Then he <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">genuflects</a> and makes the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the Cross</a> over the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>: "Behold the Blood which was shed upon Golgotha for my <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>; because of it receive my supplication." The "Sanctus fortis" is again sung, and the celebrant lifts the Sacred Body on high and says: "Holy things for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, in purity and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>!" The fraction of the Host follows after several <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> mingles a particle with the Blood, receives the Body and the Blood himself, and gives communion to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and then to the people. When it is finished he makes the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the Cross</a> with the <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a> and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesses</a> the people.

<p>Then follow a synapte (litany) of thanksgiving, and a second signing of the people with both <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a> and <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, after which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> consumes all the remaining species saying afterwards the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> at the purification and ablution. The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of blessing and protection is said, and the people and choir sing: "Alleluia! <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>! I have fed upon Thy Body and by Thy living Blood I am reconciled, and I have sought refuge in Thy Cross! Through these may I please Thee, O Good Lord, and grant Thou mercy to the sinners who call upon Thee!" Then they sing the final <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> of praise, which in this <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">anaphora</a> contains the words: "By the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of Simon Peter, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was made the royal city, and she shall not be shaken!" Then the people all say or sing the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>; when it is finished, the final benediction is given, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, coming again to the foot of the altar, takes off his <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">sacred vestments</a> and proceeds to make his thanksgiving.

<p>The principal editions of the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">missals</a> and service books for the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and those assisting at the altar are The Book of Sacrifice according to the Rite of the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite Church of Antioch</a> (Kozhayya, 1816, 1838, and 1885; Beirut, 1888), and The Book of the Ministry according to the Rite of the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> Church of Antioch (Kozhayya, 1855).
<h3>Maronites in America</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a> are chiefly from the various districts of Mount Lebanon and from the city of <a href="../cathen/02392a.htm">Beirut</a>, and were at first hardly distinguishable from the other Syrians and Arabic-speaking <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who came to America. At first they were merely pedlars and small traders, chiefly in religious and devotional articles, but they soon got into other lines of business and at present possess many well-established business enterprises. Not only are they established in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> but they have also spread to Mexico and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and have several fairly large colonies in <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentine</a>, and Uruguay. Their numbers in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> are variously estimated from 100,000 to 120,000, including the native born. Many of them have become prosperous merchants and are now American citizens. Several <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of title (<em>Emir</em>) have <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> and made their homes in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>; among them are the Emirs Al-Kazen, Al-Khouri, Abi-Saab, and others. There is also the well-known Arabic novelist of the present day, Madame Karam Hanna (Afifa Karam) of Shreveport, <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, formerly of Amshid, Mount Lebanon, who not only writes entertaining fiction, but touches on <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> topics and even <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women's</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. Nahum Mokarzel, a graduate of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> of <a href="../cathen/02392a.htm">Beirut</a>, is a clever writer both in Arabic and English. The <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a> are established in New York, the New England States, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>, and Alabama. The first <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to visit the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was Rev. Joseph Mokarzel, who arrived in 1879 but did not remain. Very Rev. Louis Kazen of Port Said, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, came later, but, as there were very few of his countrymen, he likewise returned. On 6 August, 1890, the Rev. Butrosv Korkemas came to establish a permanent mission, and after considerable difficulty rented a tiny <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in a store on Washington Street, New York City. He was accompanied by his nephew, Rev. Joseph Yasbek, then in <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> orders, who was later <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> by <a href="../cathen/04395a.htm">Archbishop Corrigan</a>, and founded the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> mission in <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>; he is now <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">Chor-Bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a> and practically the head of that rite in America.

<p>A church was later established in Philadelphia, then one in Troy and one in <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, after which the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a> branched out to other cities. At present (1911) there are fifteen <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> churches in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>: in New York, <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, Troy, <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>, <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, Lawrence, <a href="../cathen/14236c.htm">Springfield</a>, Philadelphia, <a href="../cathen/13633a.htm">Scranton</a>, <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>, <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, <a href="../cathen/15608a.htm">Wheeling</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>. Meanwhile new congregations are being formed in smaller cities, and are regularly visited by missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> is composed of two chor-bishops (deans vested with certain episcopal powers) and twenty-three other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, of whom five are Antonine <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. In Mexico there are three <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> and four <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. In <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> there is a <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> at New Glasgow and one resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. There are only two Arabic-English <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, in New York and St. Louis, since many of the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> children go to the ordinary <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or to the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. There are no general <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> or clubs with religious objects, although there is a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> branch of the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">St. Vincent de Paul Society</a>. About fifteen years ago Nahum A. Mokarzel founded and now publishes in New York City the daily newspaper, "Al Hoda" (The Guidance), which is now the best known Arabic newspaper in the world and the only illustrated one. His brother also publishes an Arabic monthly magazine, "Al Alam ul Jadid" (The <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>), which contains modern Arabic literature and translations of American and English writers. There are also two <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> papers published in Mexico. The <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a> also have in New York a publishing house on a small scale, in which novels, pamphlets, and scientific and religious works are printed in Arabic, and the usual Arabic literature sold.
<h2 id="section4">Other Oriental rites</h2>

<p>The rites already described are the principal rites to be met with in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>; but there are besides them a few representatives of the remaining Eastern rites, although these are perhaps not sufficiently numerous to maintain their own churches or to constitute separate <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> entities. Among these smaller bodies are: (1) the Chaldean <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14413a.htm">same rite</a>, known as <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>; (2) the Syrian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> or Syro-Catholics and their correlative dissenters, the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>, and (3) finally the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a>, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or Orthodox. All of these have a handful of representatives in America, and, as immigration increases, it is a question how great their numbers will become.
<h3 id="A">Chaldean or Syro-Chaldean Catholic Rite</h3>

<p>Those who profess this rite are Eastern Syrians, coming from what was anciently Mesopotamia, but is now the borderland of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. They ascribe the origin of the rite to two of the early disciples, Addeus and Maris, who first preached the Gospel in their lands. It is really a remnant of the early Persian Church, and it has always used the Syriac language in its liturgy. The principal features of the rite and the celebration of the Mass have already been described (see <a href="../cathen/01136d.htm">LITURGY OF ADDEUS AND MARIS</a>). The peculiar Syriac which it uses is known as the eastern dialect, as distinguished from that used in the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> and <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Syro-Catholic</a> rites which is the western dialect. The method of writing this church Syriac among the Chaldeans is somewhat different from that used in writing it among the western Syrians. The Chaldeans and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> use in their church books the antique letters of the older versions of the Syriac Scriptures which are called "astrangelo," and their pronunciation is somewhat different. The Chaldean Church in ancient times was most flourishing, and its history under Persian rule was a bright one. Unfortunately in the sixth century it embraced the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, for Nestorius on being removed from the See of Constantinople went to <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> and taught his views (see <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">NESTORIUS AND NESTORIANISM</a>; <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">PERSIA</a>). The <a href="../cathen/03559a.htm">Chaldean Church</a> took up his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and became <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a>. This <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Church not only extended throughout Mesopotamia and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, but penetrated also into <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> (Malabar) and even into <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. The inroads of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a> and its isolation from the centre of unity and from intercommunication with other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> bodies caused it to diminish through the centuries. In the sixteenth century the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a>, <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, came into union with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and this induced the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> to do likewise. The conversion of part of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> and the reunion of their ancient Church with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> began in the seventeenth century, and has continued to the present day. The Chaldean <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Babylon (who really has his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> at <a href="../cathen/10598b.htm">Mossul</a>) is the chief <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> of the Chaldean <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and has under him two <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> (of Diarbekir and Kerkuk) and nine <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (of Amadia, <a href="../cathen/06541b.htm">Gezireh</a>, <a href="../cathen/09650e.htm">Mardin</a>, <a href="../cathen/10598b.htm">Mossul</a>, Sakou, <a href="../cathen/13402a.htm">Salmas</a>, Seert, Sena, and Urmiah). The <a href="../cathen/14678a.htm">Malabar Christians</a> have no regular Chaldean <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, but are governed by <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>. The number of Chaldean <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> is estimated at about 70,000, while the corresponding <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Church has about 140,000 (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">ASIA</a>; <a href="../cathen/03559a.htm">CHALDEAN CHRISTIANS</a>).

<p>There are about 100 to 150 Chaldean <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>; about fifty live in Yonkers, New York, while the remainder are scattered in New York City and vicinity. The community in Yonkers is cared for by Rev. Abdul Masih (a married <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> from the Diocese of Diarbekir), who came to this country from <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> some six years ago. He says Mass in a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> attached to St. Mary's <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and some <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> also attend. At present (1911) there are two other Chaldean <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in this country: Rev. Joseph Ghariba, from the <a href="../cathen/01283b.htm">Diocese of Aleppo</a>, who is a travelling missionary for his people, and Rev. Gabriel Oussani, who is professor of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, patrology, and Oriental languages in St. Joseph's Seminary at Dunwoodie near Yonkers, and from whom some of these particulars have been obtained. There are also said to be about 150 <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the majority of these live and work in Yonkers, New York. They have no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of their own, and, where they do not attend the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Rite, are drifting into modern <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. Several of them have become members of the Episcopal Church, and they are looked after by Dr. Abraham Yohannan, an <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> from <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, now a minister in the Episcopal Church and lecturer on modern Persian at Columbia University. They have no church or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of their own.
<h3 id="B">Syro-Catholic Rite</h3>

<p>This rite is professed by those <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Syriac Christians</a> who were subjects of the ancient Patriarchate of Antioch; these are spread throughout the plains of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Western Mesopotamia, whereas the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a> live principally on Mount Lebanon and the sea coast of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> (see <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">ASIA</a>; <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">EASTERN CHURCHES</a>). The Syriac Mass and liturgy is, like the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> (which is but a variation of it), the Liturgy of St. James, Apostle and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. For this reason, but principally for the reason that Jacob Barad&aelig;us and the greater part of the Syriac Church (see JACOB BARADAEUS) embraced the <a href="../cathen/05633a.htm">Monophysite heresy of Eutyches</a> (see <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">MONOPHYSITES AND MONOPHYSITISM</a>), the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> branch of this rite are called <em>Jacobites</em>, although they call themselves <em>Suriani</em> or Syrians. Thus we have in the three Syrian rites the historic remembrance of the three greatest <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of the early Church after it had become well-developed. <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> and Chaldeans represent <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> and the return to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>; <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> and Syro-Catholics represent <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a>, and the return to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>; the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a> represent a vanished <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelitism</a> now wholly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> (see <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">MONOTHELITISM AND MONOTHELITES</a>). The Syro-Catholics like the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a> vary the Ordinary of their Mass by a large number of <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">anaphoras</a> or canons of the Mass, containing changeable forms of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> service. The Syro-Catholics confine themselves to the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">anaphoras</a> of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a>, St. James, St Peter, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, <a href="../cathen/14031b.htm">St. Xystus the Pope of Rome</a>, St. Matthew, and St. Basil; but the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> not only use these, but have a large number of others, some of them not yet in print, amounting perhaps to thirty or more (see <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">SYRIA</a>; <a href="../cathen/14413a.htm">EAST SYRIAN RITE</a>). The epistles, gospels, and many well-known <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the Mass are said in Arabic instead of the ancient Syriac. The form of their church vestments is derived substantially from the Greek or Byzantine Rite. Their church <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in union with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> consists of the Syrian <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> with three <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> (of <a href="../cathen/02202c.htm">Bagdad</a>, <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, and Homs) and five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (of <a href="../cathen/01283b.htm">Aleppo</a>, <a href="../cathen/02392a.htm">Beirut</a>, <a href="../cathen/06541b.htm">Gezireh</a>, Mardin-Diarbekir, and Mossul). The number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> is about 25,000 <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> about 80,000 to 85,000 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p>There are about 60 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of the Syro-Catholic Rite in the eastern part of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, of whom forty live in <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, New York. They are mostly from the <a href="../cathen/01283b.htm">Diocese of Aleppo</a>, and their emigration thither began only about five years ago. They have organized a church, although there is but one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of their rite in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> Rev. Paul Kassar from <a href="../cathen/01283b.htm">Aleppo</a>, an alumnus of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He is a mission <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> engaged in looking after his countrymen and resides in <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, but he is only here upon an extended leave of absence from the diocese. There are also some thirty or forty Syro-Jacobites in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>; they are mostly from <a href="../cathen/09650e.htm">Mardin</a>, <a href="../cathen/01283b.htm">Aleppo</a>, and Northern <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and have no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of their own.
<h3 id="C">Coptic Rite</h3>

<p>There is only a handful of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> in this country &#151; in New York City perhaps a dozen <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. Oriental theatrical pieces, in which an Eastern setting is required, has attracted some of them thither, principally from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. They have no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, either <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or Orthodox, and no place of worship. As to their Church and its organization, see <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">EASTERN CHURCHES</a>; EGYPT: <em>Coptic Church</em>.
