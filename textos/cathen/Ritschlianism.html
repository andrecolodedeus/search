<h1>Ritschlianism</h1>  

<p>Ritschlianism is a peculiar conception of the nature and scope of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, widely held in modern <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, especially in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Its founder was the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, Albrecht Ritschl (born at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 25 March, 1822; died at G&ouml;ttingen, 20 March, 1889). Having completed his studies in the gymnasium at Stettin, where his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> resided as general superintendent of <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>, Ritschl attended the <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">University of Bonn</a>, and was for a time captivated by the "Biblical supernaturalism" of his teacher, K.J. Nitzsch. Mental dissatisfaction <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to leave Bonn in 1841, and he continued his studies under Julius M&uuml;ller and Tholuck in the University of Halle, Disabused here also as to the teachings of his professors, he sought and found peace in the reconciliation <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the T&uuml;bingen professor, Ferdinand Christian Baur, through whose writings he was won over to the philosophy of <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a>. On 21 May, 1843, he graduated Doctor of Philosophy at Halle with the dissertation, "Expositio doctrin&aelig; Augustini de creatione mundi, peccato, gratia" (Halle, 1843). After a long residence in his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents'</a> house at Stettin, he proceeded to T&uuml;bingen, and there entered into personal intercourse with the celebrated head of the (later) T&uuml;bingen School, Ferdinand Christian Baur. He here wrote, entirely in the spirit of this <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, "Das Evangelium Marcions und das kanonische Evangelium des Lukas" (T&uuml;bingen, 1846), wherein he attempts to prove that the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> gospel of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> forms the real foundation of the Gospel of St. Luke. Having qualified as Privatdocent at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a> on 20 June, 1846, he was appointed professor extraordinary of Evangelical <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> on 22 December, 1852, and ordinary professor on 10 July, 1859. Meanwhile he had experienced a radical change in the earlier views which he had formed under Baur's influence; this change removed him farther and farther from the T&uuml;bingen School.

<p>In 1851 he had withdrawn his hypothesis concerning the origin of the Gospel of St. Luke as untenable, and in 1856 he had a public breach with Baur. Henceforth Ritschl was resolved to tread his own path. In the second edition of his "Die Entstehung der altkatholischen Kirche" (Bonn, 1857; 1st ed., 1850), he rejected outright Baur's sharp distinction between <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and the original Apostles &mdash; between Paulinism and Petrinism &mdash; by maintaining the thesis that the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> contains the religion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> in a manner entirely uniform and disturbed by no internal contradictions. At G&ouml;ttingen, whither he was called at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1864, his peculiar <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> first found full realization in his "Die christliche Lehre von der Rechtfertigung und Vers&ouml;hnung" (3 vols., Bonn, 1870-4; 4th ed., 1895-1903). His practical conception of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was described first in his lecture on "Christliche Vollkommenheit" (G&ouml;ttingen, 1874; 3rd ed., 1902) and then in his "Unterricht in der christlichen Religion" (Bonn, 1875; 6th ed., 1903), which was intended as a manual for the gymnasium, but <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> very unsatisfactory for practical purposes. In his small, but important, work, "Theologie und Metaphysik" (Bonn, 1881; 3rd ed., G&ouml;ttingen, 1902), he denies the influence of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in the formation of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. In addition to numerous smaller writings, which were re-edited after his death under the title "Gesammelte Aufs&auml;tze" (2 vols., G&ouml;ttingen, 1893-6), he compiled a "Geschichte des Pietismus" (3 vols., Bonn, 1880-6), based upon a wide study of the sources. <a href="../cathen/12080c.htm">Pietism</a> itself, as it appeared in <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> circles during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries he condemns as an abortion of modern <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> caused by the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ideal of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. His last and incomplete, "Fides implicita, oder eine Tintersuchung &uuml;ber K&ouml;hlerglauben, Wissen und Glauben, Glauben und Kirche" Bonn, 1890), appeared shortly after his death. After 1888 he suffered from heart disease, of which he died in the following year. Although Ritschl was <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> attacked during his lifetime not only by the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> party, but also by the Erlangen <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> named after Hofmann, he attached to himself a large circle of enthusiastic followers with Liberal leanings, who are included under the name of Ritschlianists. The literary organs of Ritschlianism in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> are the "Theologische Literaturzeitung", the "Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Theologie und Kirche", and the "Christliche Welt".

<p>To understand and rightly appraise the rather abstruse train of thought in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of justification, which constitutes the focus of Ritschl's <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> system, we must go back to the <a href="../cathen/05506a.htm">epistemology</a> on which the whole edifice rests. Influenced by the <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">philosophy of Kant</a> rather than of Lotze, Ritschl denies <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> the power to arrive at a scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Consequently religion cannot have an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, but merely a practical-moral foundation. Religious <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is essentially distinct from scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. It is not acquired by a theoretical insight into <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but, as the product of religious <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is bound up with the practical interests of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Religion is practice, not theory. Knowledge and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are not only distinct domains; they are independent of and separated from each other. While <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> rests on judgments of existence (<em>Seinsurteile</em>), <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> proceeds on independent "judgments of value" (<em>Werturteile</em>), which affirm nothing concerning the essence or nature of Divine things, but refer simply to the usefulness and fruitfulness of religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. Anticipating to some extent the principles of Pragmatism put forward in a later generation by W. James, Schiller, etc., Ritschl declared that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> alone valuable which in practice brings us forward. Not what the thing is "in itself", but what it is "for us", is decisive. So far Ritschl is not original, since Schleiermacher had already banished <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> philosophy, and had explained the nature of religion subjectively as springing from the feeling of our absolute dependence on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Ritschl's teaching is distinguished from that of the Berlin scholar especially by the fact that he seeks to establish a better Biblical and historical foundation for his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. In the latter respect he is the promoter of the so-called historical-critical method, of the application of which many Ritschlianists of the present day are thorough masters.



<p>Like Schleiermacher, Ritschl connects <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind's</a> subjective need of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the "originator of the perfect spiritual and moral religion". Since we can determine the historical reality of Christ only though the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community, the religious significance of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is really independent of His biography and investigation into His life. A convinced Ritschlianist seems to be ready to persevere in his <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, even though radical criticism were to succeed in setting aside the historical existence of Christ. He could be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> without Christ, as there could be a Tibetan <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> without an historical <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddha</a> (cf. "Christliche Welt", 1901, n. 35). Ritschl himself never wished to separate <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> from the Person of Christ. Since, as Ritschl especially emphasizes in reply to Baur, the original consciousness of the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community reveals itself with perfect consistency in the writings of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> must in its investigation of the authentic contents of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> begin with the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> as source, for the more thorough understanding of which the ancient <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">professions of faith</a> furnish an indirect, and the symbolical books of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> (<a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>) a direct, guidance. The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> rightly elevated the Pauline <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the central place in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>, and in the West carried it to a successful conclusion. As the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through Christ, this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of justification is thus alone <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> for <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and Church, while the other convictions and institutions of the earliest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community are of a subsidiary nature. For this reason, therefore, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> himself recognized the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> as the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only in so far as it "makes for Christ". Since the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> exists only through personal experience or subjective acquaintance with justification and reconciliation, the objects of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are not presented to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> from without through a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a> as an authoritative <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>, but become vividly present for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> only through subjective experience. The revelation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is given only to the believer who religiously lays hold of it by experience, and recognizes it as such.

<p>Justifying <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> especially is no mere passive attitude of man towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but an active trust in Him and His grace, evincing itself chiefly in <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, patience, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. It is by no means a dogmatical <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of Revelation, but it possesses essentially a thoroughly practico-moral character. Ritschlianism can thus speak without any inconsistency of an "undogmatic <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>" (Kaftan). The harmonizing of the free-religious moral activity of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> with dependence on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is proclaimed by Ritschl the "master-question of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>". This fundamental problem he solves as follows: The returning sinner is at first passively determined by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereupon justification achieves its practical success in reconciliation and regeneration, which in their turn lead to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> activity. Justification and reconciliation are so related that the former is also the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and as such removes man's consciousness of guilt (i.e., mistrust of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>), while the latter, as the cessation of active resistance to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, introduces a new direction of the will calculated to develop <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> activity in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> fulfilment of one's vocation. These two &mdash; justification and reconciliation &mdash; form the basis of our sonship as children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This justification identical with forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is however, no real annihilation of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but a forensic declaration of righteousness, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> regards the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> sinner, in spite of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as just and pleasing in consideration of the work of Christ.

<p>A special characteristic of Ritschlianism lies in the assertion that justifying <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is possible only within the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of Christ</a> (by which, however, is to be understood no external institution with legal organization) is on the one hand the aggregate of all the justified believers, but on the other hand has, as the enduring fruit of the work of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, a duration and existence prior to all its members just as the whole is prior to its parts. Like the children in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and the citizens in the state, the believers must also be born in an already existing <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community. In this alone is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> preached as the Spirit of Love, just as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> Himself preached, and in this alone, through the preaching of Christ and His work, is that justifying <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> rendered possible, in virtue of which the individual experiences regeneration and attains to adoption as a son of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (cf. Conrad, "Begriff und Bedeutung der Gemeinde in Ritschl's Theologie" in "Theol. Studien und Krit.", 1911, 230 sqq.). It is plain that, according to this view, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Christian baptism</a> loses all its importance as the real door to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>What is Ritschl's opinion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>? Does he consider Him a mere man? If we set aside the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> flourishes with which he clothes the form of the Saviour, we come speedily to the conviction that he does not recognize the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. As the efficacious bearer and transmitter of the Divine Spirit of Love to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is "superordinate" to all men, and has in the eternal <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a merely ideal pre-existence. He is therefore, as for the earliest community so also for us, our "God and Saviour" only in the metaphorical sense. All other <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> questions &mdash; such as the Trinity, the metaphysical Divine sonship of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, <a href="../cathen/05528b.htm">eschatology</a> &mdash; possess an entirely secondary importance. This self-limitation is specially injurious to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: all the <a href="../cathen/02062e.htm">Divine attributes</a>, except such as are practico-moral, are set aside as unknowable. The essence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, to which all His other attributes may be traced. Thus, His <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a> is another phase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> inasmuch as the world is nothing else than the means for the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>. Even the Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> ends in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, especially in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> fidelity to the chosen people in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community in the New. Every other explanation of the relation between the just <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> &mdash; such as the juridical <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of satisfaction taught by <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm of Canterbury</a> &mdash; is called by Ritschl "sub-Christian". Only the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the Holy Ghost, which renders man incapable of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, calls forth the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and hurls him into everlasting damnation. Other evils decreed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are not punishments for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but punishments intended for our instruction and improvement. Sin being conceivable only as personal guilt, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is morally inconceivable.

<p>Although Ritschlianism has undergone manifold alterations and developments in one direction or another at the hands of its learned representatives (Harnack, Kaftan, Bender, Sell, and so on), it has remained unchanged in its essential features. The Liberal and modern-<a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">positive theology</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> is distinctly coloured with Ritschlianism, and the efforts of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> to combat it have met with poor success. More than a decade ago Adolf Zahn ("Abriss einer Geschichte der evangelischen Kirche im 19. Jahrhundert", 3rd ed., Stuttgart, 1893) passed the sharp judgment on Ritschlianism, that it was "a <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalist</a> scepticism and <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> moralism, vainly decked out in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, the threadbare garment of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>, for purposes of deceit; the clearest sign of the complete exhaustion and impoverishment of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, which at the end of the nineteenth century again knows no more than the common folk have ever known: 'Do right and fear no man'." The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> critic will probably see in the scorn for <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> and the elimination of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> factor the chief <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Ritschlian <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. The separation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>, has indeed a long and gloomy history behind it. The philosophy of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, with its <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the "double <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>" erected the first separating wall between <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; this division was increased by <a href="../cathen/14217a.htm">Spinoza</a>, when he assigned to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the r&ocirc;le of concerning itself with <em>pia dogmata</em>, but entrusted to philosophy alone the investigation of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Finally appeared <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>, who cut the last threads which still held together <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>. By denying the demonstrability of the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> through reason, he consistently effected the complete segregation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> into two "separate households". In this he was followed by Schleiermacher and Ritschl. Since recent <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernism</a>, with its <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnosticism</a> and Immanentism, adopts the same attitude, it is, whether avowedly or not, the death-knell not only of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, but of every objective religion. Consequently, the regulations of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> against <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernism</a> represent a contest in which the vital interests of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion are at stake. As the foremost champion of the powers and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of reason in its relations with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> is the defender of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> which leads to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of metaphysical and Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, the guardian of a constant, eternal, and unalterable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the outspoken foe of every form of Scepticism, Criticism, Relativism, and Pragmatism &mdash; always in the interests of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> itself, since, without a rational foundation and substructure, Revelation and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> would hang unsupported in the air. In this statement the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> opposition to Ritschlianism in one of the most fundamental points of difference is sufficiently characterized.
