<h1>Ritual</h1>  

<p>The Ritual (<em>Rituale Romanum</em>) is one of the official books of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>. It contains all the services performed by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> that are not in the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> and <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> and has also, for convenience, some that are in those books. It is the latest and still the least uniform book of our rite.

<p>When first ritual functions were written in books, the Sacramentary in the West, the Euchologion in the East contained all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> (and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a>) part of whatever functions they performed, not only the holy Liturgy in the strict sense, but all other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>, <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a>, and rites of every kind as well. The contents of our Ritual and Pontifical were in the Sacramentaries. In the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a> this state of things still to a great extent remains. In the West a further development led to the distinction of books, not according to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who use them, but according to the services for which they are used. The <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, containing the whole Mass, succeeded the Sacramentary. Some early Missals added other rites, for the convenience of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; but on the whole this later arrangement involved the need of other books to supply the non-Eucharistic functions of the Sacramentary. These books, when they appeared, were the predecessors of our Pontifical and Ritual. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> functions (<a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, confirmation, etc.) filled the Pontifical, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> offices (<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, penance, matrimony, extreme unction, etc.) were contained in a great variety of little handbooks, finally replaced by the Ritual.

<p>The Pontifical emerged first. The book under this name occurs already in the eighth century (Pontifical of Egbert). From the ninth there is a multitude of Pontificals. For the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> functions there was no uniform book till 1614. Some of these are contained in the Pontificals; often the chief ones were added to Missals and Books of Hours. Then special books were arranged, but there was no kind of uniformity in arrangement or name. Through the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> a vast number of handbooks for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> having the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> was written. Every local rite, almost every <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, had such books; indeed many were compilations for the convenience of one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or church. Such books were called by many names&mdash;<em>Manuale, Liber agendarum, Agenda, Sacramentale</em>, sometimes <em>Rituale</em>. Specimens of such <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> predecessors of the Ritual are the <em>Manuale Curatorum</em> of Roeskilde in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> (first printed 1513, ed. J. Freisen, Paderborn, 1898), and the <em>Liber Agendarum</em> of <a href="../cathen/13542a.htm">Schleswig</a> (printed 1416, Paderborn, 1898). The Roeskilde book contains the blessing of salt and water, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, marriage, blessing of a house, visitation of the sick with viaticum and extreme unction, <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers for the dead</a>, funeral service, funeral of infants, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, blessing of fire on <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>. The Schleswig book has besides much of the <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a> services, and that for All Souls, <a href="../cathen/03245b.htm">Candlemas</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01775b.htm">Ash Wednesday</a>. In both many rites differ from the Roman forms.

<p>In the sixteenth century, while the other <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> were being revised and issued as a uniform standard, there was naturally a desire to substitute an official book that should take the place of these varied collections. But the matter did not receive the attention of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> itself for some time. First, various books were issued at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of securing uniformity, but without official sanction. Albert Castellani in 1537 published a <em>Sacerdotale</em> of this kind; in 1579 at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> another version appeared, arranged by Grancesco Samarino, Canon of the Lateran; it was re-edited in 1583 by <a href="../cathen/13100b.htm">Angelo Rocca</a>. In 1586 Giulio Antonio Santorio, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of St. Severina, printed a handbook of rites for the use of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, which, as <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> says, "he had composed after long study and with much industry and labor" (<em><a href="../cathen/01645a.htm">Apostolic&aelig; Sedis</a></em>). This book is the foundation of our Roman Ritual. In 1614 <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> published the first edition of the official Ritual by the Constitution <a href="../cathen/01645a.htm">"Apostolic&aelig; Sedis"</a> of 17 June. In this he points out that <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> had already issued a uniform text of the Pontifical and the <em>C&aelig;rimoniale Episcoporum</em>, which determines the functions of many other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> besides <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. (That is still the case. The <em>C&aelig;rimoniale Episcoporum</em> forms the indispensable complement of other <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> too.) "It remained", the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> continues, "that the sacred and authentic rites of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to be observed in the administration of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions by those who have the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, should also be included in one book and published by authority of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>; so that they should carry out their office according to a public and fixed standard, instead of following so great a multitude of Rituals".

<p>But, unlike the other books of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, the Ritual has never been imposed as the only standard. <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> did not abolish all other collections of the same kind, nor command every one to use only his book. He says: "Wherefore we exhort in the Lord" that it should be adopted. The result of this is that the old local Rituals have never been altogether abolished. After the appearance of the Roman edition these others were gradually more and more conformed to it. They continued to be used, but had many of their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and ceremonies modified to agree with the Roman book. This applies especially to the rites of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, the form of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, extreme unction. The ceremonies also contained in the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> (<a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>, the processions of <a href="../cathen/03245b.htm">Candlemas</a> and <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a>, etc.), and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> also in the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> (the Office for the Dead) are necessarily identical with those of <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V's</a> Ritual; these have the absolute authority of the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> and <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>. On the other hand, many countries have local customs for marriage, the visitation of the sick, etc., numerous special <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>, processions and <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a> not found in the Roman book, still printed in various <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> Rituals. It is then by no means the case that every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the Roman Rite uses the Roman Ritual. Very many <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> or provinces still have their own local handbooks under the name of <em>Rituale</em> or another (<em>Ordo administrandi sacramenta</em>, etc.), though all of these conform to the Roman text in the chief elements. Most contain practically all the Roman book, and have besides local additions.

<p>The further history of the <em>Rituale Romanum</em> is this: <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> in 1752 revised it, together with the Pontifical and <em>C&aelig;rimoniale Episcoporum</em>. His new editions of these three books were published by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Quam ardenti" (25 March, 1752), which quotes <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V's</a> Constitution at length and is printed, as far as it concerns this book, in the beginning of the Ritual. He added to <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V's</a> text two forms for giving the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> blessing (V, 6; VIII, 31). Meanwhile a great number of additional <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> were added in an appendix. This appendix is now nearly as long as the original book. Under the title <em>Benedictionale Romanum</em> it is often issued separately. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> approved an <em>editio typica</em> published by <a href="../cathen/12583a.htm">Pustet</a> at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> in 1884. This is now out of date. The Ritual contains several chants (for processions, burials, <a href="../cathen/11220a.htm">Office of the Dead</a>, etc.). These should be conformable to the <em>Motu Proprio</em> of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> of 22 Nov., 1903, and the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Sacred Congregation of Rites of 8 Jan., 1904. All the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> publishers now issue editions of this kind, approved by the Congregation.

<p>The <em>Rituale Romanum</em> is divided into ten "titles" (<em>tituli</em>); all, except the first, subdivided into chapters. In each (except I and X) the first chapter gives the general rules for the sacrament or function, the others give the exact ceremonies and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for various cases of administration. <em>Titulus</em> I (<em>caput unicum</em>) is "of the things to be observed in general in the administration of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>"; II, About <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, chap. vi gives the rite when a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> baptizes, vii the blessing of the font, not on <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a> or Whitsun Eve; III, Penance and absolutions from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>; IV, Administration of <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> (not during Mass); V, Extreme Unction, the seven penitential psalms, <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a>, visitation and care of the dying, the <a href="../cathen/02602a.htm">Apostolic blessing</a>, commendation of a departing <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; VI, Of funerals, <a href="../cathen/11220a.htm">Office of the Dead</a>, absolutions at the grave on later days, funerals of infants; VII, Matrimony and churching of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; VII, Blessings of <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>, candles, houses (on <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>), and many others; then <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> reserved to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who have special faculties, such as those of vestments, <em>ciboriums</em>, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, foundation stones, a new church (not, of course, the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, which is in the Pontifical), cemeteries, etc.; IX, Processions, for <a href="../cathen/03245b.htm">Candlemas</a>, <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a>, Rogation Days, <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>, etc.; X, <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">Exorcism</a> and forms for filling up <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> books (of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, confirmation, marriage, <em>status animarum</em>, the dead). The <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> of tit. VIII are the old ones of the Ritual. The appendix that follows tit. X contains additional forms for blessing <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> water, for confirmation as administered by a missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, decrees about <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> and the "Forty Hours" devotion, the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a> of Loreto and the Holy Name. Then follow a long series of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>, not reserved; reserved to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> they delegate, reserved to certain <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders; then more <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> (novissim) and a second appendix containing yet another collection. These appendixes grow continually. As soon as the Sacred Congregation of Rites approves a new blessing it is added to the next edition of the Ritual.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01394a.htm">Milanese Rite</a> has its own ritual (<em>Rituale Ambrosianum</em>, published by Giacomo Agnelli at the Archiepiscopal Press, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>). In the Byzantine Rite the contents of our ritual are contained in the <em>Euchologion</em>. The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> have a ritual (<em>Mashdotz</em>) like ours. Other <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> Churches have not yet arranged the various parts of this book in one collection. But nearly all the Eastern <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> now have Rituals formed on the Roman model (see <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">LITURGICAL BOOKS</a>, IV).
