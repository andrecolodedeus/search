<h1>Robber Council of Ephesus</h1>  

<p>(L<font size=-2>ATROCINIUM</font>).

<p>The Acts of the first session of this synod were read at the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, 451, and have thus been preserved to us. The remainder of the Acts (the first session being wanting) are known only through a Syriac translation by a <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, published from the British Museum <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> Addit. 14,530, written in the year 535. On the events which preceded the opening of the council, 8 August, 449, see <a href="../cathen/05018a.htm">DIOSCORUS</a>. The emperor had convoked it, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had agreed. No time had been left for any Western <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to attend, except a certain Julius of an unknown see, who, together with a Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Renatus (he died on the way), and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Hilarus, afterwards <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, represented <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo</a>. The Emperor Theodosius II gave <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscorus</a>, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>, the presidency &#151; <em>ten authentian kai ta proteia</em>. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> Julius is mentioned next, but when this name was read at <a href="../cathen/03554a.htm">Chalcedon</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> cried: "He was cast out. No one represented Leo." Next in order was Juvenal of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, above both the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, Domnus, and <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">St. Flavian</a> of Constantinople. The number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> present was 127, with eight representatives of absent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and lastly the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Hilarus with his notary Dulcitius. The question before the council by order of the emperor was whether <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">St. Flavian</a>, in a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held by him at Constantinople in November, 448, had justly deposed and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Archimandrite Eutyches</a> for refusing to admit two natures in Christ. Consequently <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a> and six other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who had been present at his synod, were not allowed to sit as judges in the council. The brief of convocation by Theodosius was read, and then the Roman <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> explained that it would have been contrary to custom for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to be present in person, but he had sent a letter by them. In this letter <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo</a> had appealed to his dogmatic letter to <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a>, which he intended to be read at the council and accepted by it as a <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscorus</a> took care not to have it read, and instead of it a letter of the emperor, ordering the presence at the council of the fanatical anti-Nestorian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Barsumas, was presented. The question of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was next proceeded with. <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscorus</a> declared that this was not a matter for inquiry: they had only to inquire into the recent doings. He was acclaimed as a guardian of the Faith. <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a> then was introduced, and declared that he held the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a>, to which nothing could be added, and from which nothing could be taken away. He had been condemned by <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a> for a mere slip of the tongue, though he had declared that he held the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Nicaea and Ephesus, and had appealed to the present council. He had been in danger of his life. He now asked for judgment against the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> which had been brought against him.

<p>The accuser of <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a>, <a href="../cathen/05622a.htm">Bishop Eusebius of Dorylaeum</a>, was not allowed to be heard. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> agreed that the Acts of the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a>, at a council held at Constantinople in November, 448, should be read, but the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> asked that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> letter might be heard first. <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a> interrupted with the complaint that he did not trust the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>; they had been to dine with <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a>, and had received much courtesy. <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscorus</a> decided that the Acts of the trial should have precedence, and so the letter of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo</a> was never read at all. The Acts were then read in full (for an account of them see <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">EUTYCHES</a>), and also the account of an inquiry made on 13 April into the allegation of <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a> that the synodal Acts had been incorrectly taken down, and of another inquiry on 27 April into the accusation made by <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a> that <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a> had drawn up the sentence against him beforehand. While the trial was being related, cries arose of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in one nature, that two natures meant <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>, of "Burn Eusebius", and so forth. <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">St. Flavian</a> rose to complain that no opportunity was given him of defending himself. The Acts of the Robber Council now give a list of 114 votes in the form of short speeches absolving <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a>. Even three of his former judges joined in this, although by the emperor's order they were not to vote. Barsumas added his voice in the last place. A petition was read from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a>, which had been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a>. On the assertion of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> that they agreed in all things with <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a>, and with the holy Fathers, the synod absolved them.

<p>Next in order to establish the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith an extract was read from the Acts of the first session of the Council of Ephesus of 431. Many of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and also the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Hilarus, expressed their assent, some adding that nothing beyond this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> could be allowed. <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscorus</a> then spoke, declaring that it followed that <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a> and <a href="../cathen/05622a.htm">Eusebius</a> must be deposed. No less than 101 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> gave their votes orally, and the signatures of all the 135 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> follow in the Acts. <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a> and <a href="../cathen/05622a.htm">Eusebius</a> had previously interposed an appeal to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and to a council under his authority. Their formal letters of appeal have been recently published by Amelli. The evidence given at Chalcedon is conclusive that the account in the Acts of this final scene of the session is not to be trusted. The secretaries of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had been <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> prevented from taking notes. It was declared that both Barsumas and <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscorus</a> struck <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a>, though this may be exaggeration. But we must believe that many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> threw themselves on their knees to beg <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscorus</a> for mercy to <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a>, that the military were introduced and also Alexandrine <a href="../cathen/11467a.htm">Parabolani</a>, and that a scene of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> ensued; that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> signed under the influence of bodily fear, that some signed a blank paper, and that others did not sign at all, the names being afterwards filled in of all who were actually present.



<p>The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> Hilarus uttered a single word in Latin, <em>Contradicitur</em>, annulling the sentence in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> name. He then escaped with difficulty. <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a> was deported into exile, and died a few days later in Lydia. No more of the Acts was read at Chalcedon. But we learn from Theodoret, <a href="../cathen/05639b.htm">Evagrius</a>, and others, that the Robber Council deposed Theodoret himself, Domnus, and Ibas. The Syriac Acts take up the history where the Chalcedonian Acts break off. Of the first session only the formal documents, letters of the emperor, petitions of <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a>, are known to be preserved in Syriac, though not in the same <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> It is evident that the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> editor thoroughly disapproved of the first session, and purposely omitted it, not because of the high-handed proceedings of <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscorus</a>, but because the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> as a general rule condemned <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a> as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, and did not wish to remember his rehabilitation by a council which they considered to be ecumenical.

<p>In the next session, according to the Syriac Acts, 113 were present, including Barsumas. Nine new names appear. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> were sent for, as they did not appear, but only the notary Dulcitius could be found, and he was unwell. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> had shaken off the dust of their feet against the assembly. It was a charge against <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscorus</a> at Chalcedon that he "had held an (ecumenical) council without the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, which was never allowed". This manifestly refers to his having continued at the council after the departure of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>. The first case was that of Ibas, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>. This famous champion of the Antiochian party had been accused of crimes before Domnus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and had been acquitted, soon after <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 448. His accusers had gone to Constantinople and obtained a new trial from the emperor. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Photius of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, Eustathius of Berytus, and Uranius of Imeria were to examine the matter. These <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> met at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, removed to Berytus, and returned to <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, and eventually acquitted Ibas once more, together with his fellow-accused, Daniel, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Harran, and John of Theodosianopolis. This was in February, 449. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had been too kind, Cheroeas, Governor of Osrhoene was now ordered to go to <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> to make a new inquiry. He was received by the people on 12 April with shouts (the detailed summary of which took up some two or three pages of his report), in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the emperor, the governor, the late Bishop Rabbula, and against Nestorius and Ibas. Cheroeas sent to Constantinople, with two letters of his own, an elaborate report, detailing all the accusations he could manage to rake together against Ibas. The emperor ordered that a new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should be chosen. It was this report, which provided a history of the whole affair, that was now read at length by order of <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscorus</a>. When the famous letter of Ibas to Maris was read, cries arose such as "These things pollute our ears . . . Cyril is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> . . . Let Ibas be burnt in the midst of the city of Antioch . . . Exile is of no use. Nestorius and Ibas should be burnt together!" A final indictment was made in a speech by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> named Eulogius. Sentence was finally given against Ibas of deposition and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, without any suggestion that he ought to be cited or that his defence ought to be heard. It is <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> to find the three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had acquitted him but a few months previously, only anxious to show their concurrence. They even pretended to forget what had been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and Berytus. In the next case, that of Ibas's nephew, Daniel of Harran, they declared that at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> they had clearly seen his guilt, and had only acquitted him because of his <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> resignation. He was quickly deposed by the agreement of all the council. He was, of course, not present and could not defend himself.

<p>It was next the turn of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, who as an influential <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> at the former Council of Ephesus had shown much favour to Nestorius. He had later become <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, but the emperor had deposed him in 448, and the miserable Photius, already mentioned, had succeeded him. The synod made no difficulty in ratifying the deposition of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> as a bigamist and a blasphemer. Aquilinus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Byblus, because he had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> and was his friend, was next deposed. Sophronius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tella, was a cousin of Ibas. He was therefore accused of magic, and his case was reserved for the judgment of the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> &#151; a surprisingly mild decision. The council turned to higher game. The great Theodoret, whose learning and eloquence in the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> and with the pen were the terror of the party of <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscorus</a>, had been confined by the emperor within his own diocese in the preceding year, to prevent his preaching at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>; and Theodosius had twice written to prevent his coming to Ephesus to the council. It was not difficult to find reasons for deposing him in his absence. Far as he was from being a <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a>, he had been a friend of Nestorius, and for more than three years (431-4) the most redoubtable antagonist of St. Cyril. But the two great <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> had come to terms and had celebrated their agreement with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Theodoret had tried to make friends with <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscorus</a>, but his advances had been rejected with scorn. A <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Antioch now brought forward a volume of extracts from the works of Theodoret. First was read Theodoret's fine letter to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the East (see <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, V, 1023), then some extracts from a lost "Apology for Diodorus and Theodore" &#151; the very name of this work sufficed in the eyes of the council for a condemnation to be pronounced. <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscorus</a> pronounced the sentence of deposition and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>.

<p>When Theodoret in his remote diocese heard of this absurd sentence on an absent man against whose reputation not a word was uttered, he at once appealed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in a famous letter (Ep. cxiii). He wrote also to the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> Renatus (Ep. cxvi), being unaware that he was dead. The council had a yet bolder task before it. Domnus of Antioch is said to have agreed in the first session to the acquittal of <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a>. But he refused, on the plea of sickness, to appear any more at the council. He seems to have been disgusted, or terrified, or both, at the tyranny exercised by <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscorus</a>. The council had sent him an account of their actions, and he replied (if we may believe the Acts) that he agreed to all the sentences that had been given and regretted that his health made his attendance impossible.

<p>It is almost incredible that immediately after receiving this message, the council proceeded to hear a number of petitions from <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> against Domnus himself. He was accused of friendship with Theodoret and <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a>, of Nestoriaism, of altering the form of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Sacrament of Baptism</a>, of intruding an immoral <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> into <a href="../cathen/05402a.htm">Emesa</a>, of having been uncanonically appointed himself, and in fact of being an enemy of <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscorus</a>. Several pages of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> are unfortunately lost; but it does not seem that the unfortunate patriarch was cited to appear, or given a chance of defending himself. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> shouted that he was worse than Ibas. He was deposed by a vote of the council, and with this final act of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> the Acts come to an end. The council wrote the usual letter to the emperor (see see Perry, trans., p. 431), who was charmed with the result of the council and confirmed it with a letter (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, VII, 495, and Perry, p. 364). <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscorus</a> sent an <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">encyclical</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the East, with a form of adhesion to the council which they were to sign (Perry, p. 375). He went to Constantinople and appointed his secretary Anatolius <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that great see. Juvenal of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> had become his tool, he had deposed the Patriarchs of Antioch and Constantinople; but one powerful adversary yet remained. He halted at <a href="../cathen/11043a.htm">Nicaea</a>, and with ten <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the ten <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> whom he had brought to Ephesus), "in addition to all his other crimes he extended his madness against him who had been entrusted with the guardianship of the Vine by the Saviour" &#151; in the words of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at Chalcedon &#151; and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself.

<p>Meanwhile <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo</a> had received the appeals of Theodoret and <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a> (of whose death he was unaware), and had written to them and to the emperor and empress that all the Acts of the council were null. He <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> all who had taken part in it, and absolved all whom it had condemned, with the exception of Domnus of Antioch, who seems to have had no wish to resume his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> and retired into the monastic life which he had left many years before with regret. (For the results of the Robber Council, or Latrocinium &#151; the name given to it by <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo</a> &#151; see <a href="../cathen/03554a.htm">CHALCEDON</a>, <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">EUTYCHES</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">POPE LEO I</a>.)
