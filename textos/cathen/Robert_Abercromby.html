<h1>Robert Abercromby</h1>  

<p>(Sometimes known as Sanders and as Robertson).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> in the time of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, born 1532; died at Braunsberg, in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, 27 April, 1613. He was brought into prominence chiefly by the fact that he <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> the Queen of James I of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, when that monarch was as yet James VI of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. The Queen was Anne of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, and her father, an ardent <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>, has stipulated that she should have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to practice her own religion in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and for that purpose sent with her a <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> named John Lering who, however, shortly after his arrival, became a <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a>. The Queen, who abhorred <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>, asked some of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> nobles for advice, and it was suggested to call Father Abercromby, who, with some other <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, was secretly working among the Scotch <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and winning many illustrious <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Though brought up a <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>, Queen Anne had in her youth lived with a niece of the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a>, and not only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> something of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, but had frequently been present at Mass with her former friend. Abercromby was introduced into the palace, instructed the Queen in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, and received her into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This was about the year 1600. As to the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> there is some controversy. Andrew Lang, who merely quotes Mac Quhirrie as to the fact of the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>, without mentioning Abercromby, puts it as occurring in 1598. Intelligence of it at last came to the ears of the King, who, instead of being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, warned her to keep it secret, as her <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> might imperil his crown. He even went as far as to appoint Abercromby Superintendent of the Royal Falconry, in order that he might remain near the Queen. Up to the time that James succeeded to the crown of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, Father Abercromby remained at the Scottish Court, celebrating Mass in secret, and giving <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> nine or ten times to his <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophyte</a>. When the King and Queen were <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> sovereigns of Great Britain, Anne gave <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of her sincerity by absolutely refusing to receive the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, declaring that she preferred to forfeit her crown rather than take part in what she considered a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">profanation</a>. Of this, Lang, in his "History of Scotland", says nothing. She made several ineffectual attempts to <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">convert</a> the King. Abercromby remained in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> for some time, but as a price of 10,000 crowns was put upon his head he came to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, only to find that the King's kindly dispositions toward him had undergone a change. The alleged discovery of a <a href="../cathen/07081b.htm">Gunpowder Plot</a> in 1605, and the attempts made to implicate the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in the conspiracy had excited in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the King feelings of bitter hostility to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. He ordered a strict search to be made for Abercromby, who consequently left the country and betook himself to Braunsberg, in Eastern <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, where he died, in his eighty-first year.
