<h1>Robert Aston Coffin</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, b. at Brighton, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 19 July, 1819; d. at Teignmouth, Devonshire, 6 April, 1885. He received his secondary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at Harrow and in 1837 went to Christ Church, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, where he took his <a href="../cathen/01756c.htm">B.A. degree</a> with honours in 1840. He then prepared himself for the ministry and, having received <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">Anglican orders</a> from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, he was appointed in 1843 vicar of St. Mary Magdalen, <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">Oxford</a>. While at Oxford he had become a follower of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Dr. Newman</a>, and like so many others who had joined the Oxford or <a href="../cathen/11370a.htm">Tractarian Movement</a> he left the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> and was received into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at Prior Park on the feast of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, 3 December, 1845, two months after the reception of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Dr. Newman</a>. Having spent a year as tutor in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/04698c.htm">Mr. Ambrose de Lisle</a>, he followed <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to prepare himself for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> 31 October, 1847, by the <a href="../cathen/03341b.htm">cardinal vicar</a>. In the meantime <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Dr. Newman</a> had been authorized by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> to found the <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratory of St. Philip Neri</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. When, in June, 1848, the Oratory was established, Father Coffin with other convert <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> joined it, and he was appointed superior of St. Wilfrid's, Cottam Hall. The next year he followed a strong attraction he had felt since his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer</a>, left the Oratory, and entered the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at Saint-Trond, in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. Having made his profession on 2 February, 1852, he returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and began his long and fruitful career as a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a> missionary. From 1850 to 1865 he was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Mary's, Clapham and from the latter year till 1882 he held the office of <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>. These offices, however, did not prevent him from <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> labouring with pen and tongue, for, from 1852 to 1872, he was almost constantly engaged in giving missions and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> retreats throughout <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and in publishing many ascetical books.

<p>After the death of Dr. Danell, the second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14162b.htm">Southwark</a>, Father Coffin was chosen as his successor, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Cardinal Howard, in the church of S. Alfonso, 11 June, 1882, taking possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> on 27 July. After an illness of several months, borne with great <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, Bishop Coffin died at Teignmouth, in the house of the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> which he himself had founded when provincial. "Although his name was at no time conspicuously before the world, his influence had been widely and deeply felt, and few <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> were held in greater esteem or affection. By the publication of many of the works of <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus</a>, by his labours as a preacher and missionary in his younger days, by his numerous retreats, especially to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and still more by his government of the Province of the Congregation of the Most Holy redeemer in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> during nearly twenty vears, he performed a quiet, solid and enduring work which will be felt for many generations" ("The Tablet", London). Among his publications are the following English translations of the Italian works of St. Alphonsus: "The Glories of Mary" (London, 1862, 1868), "The Mysteries of the Faith: The Incarnation" (London, 1854); "The Christian Virtues" (London, 1854), "The Mysteries of the Faith: The Eucharist" (London, 1855), "Visits to the Most Holy Sacrament" (London, 1855); "The Eternal Truths" (London, 1857); "A Devotion in Honour of St. Joseph" (London, 1860); "The Mysteries of the Faith: The Redemption" (London, 1861); "Hymns and Verses on Spiritual Subjects" (London, 1863). He also published a translation of "The Oratory of the Faithful Soul" by Blosius (London, 1848), and several pastoral letters.
