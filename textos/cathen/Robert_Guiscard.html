<h1>Robert Guiscard</h1>  

<p>Duke of Apulia and Calabria, founder of the Norman state of the Two Sicilies; born about 1016; died 17 July, 1085. He was the eldest son of the second marriage of Tancred, seigneur of Haute-ville-la-Guichard near <a href="../cathen/04455b.htm">Coutances</a>, <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, a fief of ten chevaliers. Already three of his brothers, William Bras-de-Fer and Drogo, about 1034, and Humphrey, about 1045, had entered the pay of the Lombard princes of Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> who were in revolt against the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>. In turn Robert left Normandy accompanied by five horsemen and thirty foot-soldiers, and set out to rejoin his brothers in 1046. Of gigantic stature, broad-shouldered, with blond hair, ruddy complexion, and deep voice, he owed to his crafty shrewdness the soubriquet of "Guiscard" (Wiseacre). He encountered difficulties on his first entrance into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. His brother Drogo, who had been elected Count of the Normans, repulsed him. Having wandered about for a time he returned to enter the service of Drogo and assisted him to conquer Calabria. He established himself at the head of a small troop on the heights of San Marco, which dominated the valley of the Crati, whence he practised actual brigandage, surprising the Byzantine posts, pillaging <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and robbing travellers. But subsequent to his marriage with Aubr&eacute;e, a kinswoman of a Norman chief of the territory of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, he renounced this manner of life and had two hundred horsemen under his command. Drogo having been assassinated in 1051, his brother Humphrey succeeded to his possessions and the title of Count of the Normans, and Guiscard remained in his service. In 1053, he took part in the battle of Civitella, in which <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Pope Leo IX</a> was vanquished and taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> by the Normans. In 1055, he took possession of <a href="../cathen/11351c.htm">Otranto</a>. On the death of Humphrey in 1057, Robert Guiscard caused himself to be elected leader of the Normans to the detriment of the two sons of his brother, whose inheritance he appropriated. At this juncture the Normans aimed openly at taking possession of southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Richard of <a href="../cathen/02151a.htm">Aversa</a>, who had just taken <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, was after Guiscard the most powerful leader. Through energy of character and skilful policy, Robert Guiscard succeeded in inducing the Norman chiefs to submit to his authority and in accomplishing with them the conquest of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He established his young brother Roger in Calabria in 1058. In 1059, <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a>, the chief councillor of <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Pope Nicholas II</a>, desiring to shield the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> from the attacks of the adversaries of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform, entered into an alliance with the Normans. At the Council of Melfi (August, 1059), Guiscard declared himself the vassal of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, pledged himself to bring about the observance of the decrees of the Council of Lateran with regard to the election of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, and received in exchange the title of Duke with the investiture of his conquests in Apulia, Calabria, and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. He at once began to make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on the remaining Byzantine possessions, took possession of <a href="../cathen/12717a.htm">Reggio</a> (1060), despatched his brother Roger to begin the conquest of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, took <a href="../cathen/02787e.htm">Brindisi</a> (1002), and finally, in 1068, laid siege to <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a>, the capital of Byzantine <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, which he entered after a siege of three years on 16 April, 1071. In the following year, the capture of Palermo, besieged at once by Robert and Roger, left the Normans masters of all <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. Roger retained the greater part of the country, but remained his brother's vassal.

<p>These conquests would have been but of ephemeral duration had Guiscard not devoted all his energy to consolidating them. The Norman chiefs who had become his vassals were not too readily disposed to submit to his authority, and revolted while he was in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. In 1073 Guiscard besieged and reduced to submission all the rebels in succession. The great commercial republic of <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a> yielded <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> to him. At this juncture, however, <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, alarmed by Guiscard's aggressions on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> territories <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him. At the same time, Guiscard having wished on the occasion of his daughter's marriage to raise the usual <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> aid, his vassals once more revolted (1078). Having put down this revolt, Guiscard was once again all-powerful, and <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, threatened by the intrigues of <a href="../cathen/07230a.htm">Emperor Henry IV</a>, became reconciled to him (1080). In the interval <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a> had fallen under his sway, and, save for the Norman principality of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, which remained independent, and the city of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, all southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> obeyed him.

<p>Having now reached the height of his power, Guiscard conceived the <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>, at the age of sixty-four, to undertake the conquest of the Byzantine empire, whose civilization exercised over him a powerful attraction. As the master of Byzantine <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, he considered himself the heir of the emperors, caused himself to be depicted on his seal in their costume, and thus inaugurated a tradition which nearly all sovereigns of the Two Sicilies down to Charles of Anjou sought to follow. In May, 1081, Robert and his son Bohemond set out for <a href="../cathen/11351c.htm">Otranto</a>, captured the island of <a href="../cathen/04362a.htm">Corfu</a>, and disembarked before Durazzo, the possession of which would assure them access to the Via Egnatia, which led through <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a> to Constantinople. But the emperor Alexius Comnenus had formed an alliance with <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, whose fleet won a great victory over that of the Normans (July). Alexius came himself to the assistance of <a href="../cathen/05209a.htm">Durazzo</a>, but Guiscard, who had burnt his ships in order to inspire <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> in his troops, put the imperial army to flight (18 October). Despite this victory, the Normans, being still incapable of laying siege in the regular manner, could not have entered into the place, if Guiscard had not contrived that it should be delivered to him by treason (21 February, 1082). Guiscard was now master of the route to Constantinople, and had advanced as far as Castoria when he received a letter from <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> recalling him to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Henry IV, with whom Alexius Comnenus had formed an alliance, had come down into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and was threatening <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. At his approach the Lombard vassals of Apulia and the Prince of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a> had revolted. Guiscard resigned the command of his expedition to his son Bohemond, who abandoned the march on Constantinople to ravage Thessaly. Guiscard returned to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and profited by Henry IV's short delay in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> to subdue his rebellious vassals, capturing their cities one by one (1083). During this time Henry IV returned and laid siege to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On 2 June, 1083, he took possession of the Leonine City, and compelled <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> to seek refuge in the castle of Sant' Angelo. The emperor made his entry into <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 21 March, 1084, and, on the following 31 March, he was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> at St. Peter's by the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Clement III</a>. <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, who all the time was confined to the castle of Sant' Angelo, sent a message to Robert Guiscard. On 24 May, 30,000 Normans camped beneath the walls of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On the 27 May, Guiscard captured the Porta Flaminia, gave battle on the Campo Mania, delivered <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> and installed him in the Lateran while the imperial troops beat a retreat. But the Romans, exasperated by the pillaging of the Normans, revolted. The city was sacked, and the inhabitants massacred or sold as slaves. On the 28 June, Guiscard left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and conducted <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> as far as <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a>. Thanks to his intervention the projects of Henry IV had been baffled and the cause of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform had triumphed.

<p>But Robert Guiscard thought only of resuming his expedition against Constantinople. Beaten by the troops of Alexius Comnenus, Bohemond had been compelled to retire with his army to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (1083). Guiscard made fresh preparations, and, at the end of 1084, embarked at <a href="../cathen/11351c.htm">Otranto</a>. After having defeated the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> fleet, he recovered <a href="../cathen/04362a.htm">Corfu</a> and was preparing to capture <a href="../cathen/15750a.htm">Cephalonia</a>, where he had just disembarked, when he died after a short illness, 17 July, 1085. Having come into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> forty years previously as a mere soldier of fortune, he had since founded a sovereign state and become one of the most important personages of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. Two emperors had had to reckon with him. From one of them he had taken <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, from the other he had been on the point of taking Constantinople. In 1058, he had repudiated Aubr&eacute;e, the mother of Bohemond, to wed the Lombard Sykelgaite, sister of Gisulf, Prince of <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a>. She gave him three Sons and seven daughters, and appears to have been actively associated in all his undertakings, accompanying him in his expeditions and exercising so much influence over him as to cause him to designate as his successor his son Roger, to the detriment of Bohemond.
