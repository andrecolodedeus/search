<h1>Robert Henryson</h1>  

<p>Scottish poet, born probably 1420-1430; died about 1500.

<p>His birthplace, parentage, and place of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> are unknown, but it is conjectured that he may have been at some foreign university &#151; perhaps <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> or <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>.

<p>Little, also, is known of his later life. The earliest extant edition of his <em>Fables</em> (1570) described him on its title-page as "Scholemaister of Dunfermeling". It is probable that he was a master at the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05192a.htm">Abbey of Dunfermline</a>, was in <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, and a notary public of that town. In 1462 he seems to have been admitted as a member of the newly-founded <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>.

<p>The order or the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of composition of his poems is not known. As a poet he belongs to the group of Northern or Scottish <a href="../cathen/03642b.htm">Chaucerians</a>, who, at a time when poetry in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was at a very low ebb, were practising the art of verse in a way worthy of the followers of <a href="../cathen/03642b.htm">Chaucer</a>. Amongst these poets Henryson stands out as especially original &#151; perhaps the most truly <a href="../cathen/03642b.htm">Chaucerian</a> of them all.

<p>His work shows much variety and consists of two rather long poems, the <em>Testament of Cresseid</em>, and <em>Orpheus and Eurydice</em>, of a collection of <em>Morall Fabillis of Esope</em>, with a prologue attached - and of a number of miscellaneous shorter poems, of which the pastoral dialogue of <em>Robene and Makyne</em> is the best known.

<p>All these poems are remarkable, and sometimes of high poetic power. The <em>Testament of Cresseid</em>, in the well-known rhyme-royal seven line stanza, is a not unworthy tragic sequel to <a href="../cathen/03642b.htm">Chaucer's</a> <em>Troylus</em>. The thirteen pastoral <em>Fables</em>, also in rhyme-royal, are told with great freshness, humour, and directness, and the moral of each does not lose by being kept artistically separate from the story. The pastoral <em>Robene and Makyne</em> is, however, generally ranked as his most artistic achievement. Henryson, like all the Scottish <a href="../cathen/03642b.htm">Chaucerians</a>, was a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> lover of nature, which he describes carefully and vividly.

<p>His <em>Fables</em> were re-edited by Gregory Smith, for the Scottish Text Society, in 1906.
