<h1>Robert Kilwardby</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12290a.htm">Porto and Santa Rufina</a>; died at <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, 11 Sept., 1279. Nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of his birth or early life, except that he studied at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and probably Oxford. For many years he taught grammar and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> with special success, devoting particular attention to the development of the use of the syllogism, during which time he composed numerous treatises on grammar and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Of these the work "De divisione scientiarum" was widely studied, as is evidenced by the numerous <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> still extant. Later in life he also wrote some <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works: "De passione Christi", "De sacramento altaris", and some commentaries on Scripture. Feeling called to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of Preachers</a>, he abandoned his secular career and became a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, devoting himself to <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and the study of the Scriptures and the Fathers. In 1261 he was chosen <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the order in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, an office which he held till 1272. Shortly after he ceased to be provincial he was chosen by <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Pope Gregory X</a> to fill the See of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, which had then been vacant for two years. As archbishop-elect he, together with other nobles and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, proclaimed Edward I as King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> on the death of Henry III, and appointed a regency to govern the kingdom till the new king returned from the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> on 26 Feb., 1273, by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02347b.htm">Bath and Wells</a>, William Bytton, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> having allowed him to nominate the consecrating <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>. On 8 May he received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, and he was <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> in September of the same year, he being the first friar to become <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>.

<p>As <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> he showed little interest in politics, but was very energetic in the administration of the spiritual <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. Having held a convocation in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, he entered upon a thorough visitation of the province. This was interrupted in 1274, as he had to leave <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to attend the Council of Lyons. Here he distinguished himself as an ardent supporter of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> authority, and his own reputation as a great master of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> added weight to his advocacy. On his return to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> he resumed his <a href="../cathen/15479a.htm">canonical visitation</a>, traveling through the large <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> and Lincoln. In 1276 he visited the <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">University of Oxford</a>, where he condemned several <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, deprived masters who held <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> opinions, and took other measures for safeguarding purity of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. In the same year (16 June, 1276) he had the consolation of attending the translation of the relics of St. Richard at <a href="../cathen/03657a.htm">Chichester</a>, whose life he had encouraged his brother <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Ralph Boeking, to write. As <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> he held two important <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> in 1273 and 1277, in which the lower <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were granted fuller representation than had formerly been allowed. In his private life he was noted for his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, his charity to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and his success as a peacemaker. He was a great benefactor of his own order, and bought the site for a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> house at Castle Barnard in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. In 1278 <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Pope Nicholas III</a> nominated Kilwardby as <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12290a.htm">Porto and Santa Rufina</a>, and on 25 July he left <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, taking with him all the registers and archives of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a>. This unfortunate loss has never been recovered, and the earliest records of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> are those of his successor Archbishop Peckham, who vainly endeavoured to recover the lost papers. The change of life was too severe for an old man, and he fell ill shortly after joining the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court at <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>. There he died in the following year and was buried in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of his own order.
