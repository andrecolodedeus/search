<h1>Robert Pullen</h1>  

<p>(POLENIUS, PULLAN, PULLEIN, PULLENUS, PULLY, LA POULE)

<p><em>See also</em> <a href="../cathen/13098b.htm">ROBERT PULLEN</a>.

<p>Died 1147 (?). Nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of his early life except that he was of English parentage. The conjecture of a recent biographer (Williams, op. cit. <em>infra</em>) that he was born at Poole in Dorsetshire is not supported by any evidence. Other accounts state that he came from Devonshire. John of <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Hexham</a>, in his continuation of the history of Symeon of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, written within half a century of Pullen's death, asserts that Henry I offered him a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> which he refused, being devoted to the study of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. His early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was received in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but during the troubles which began with the accession of King Stephen in 1135 he seems to have gone to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to continue his life of study in peace there. According to other accounts, he completed his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he subsequently lectured before returning to Oxford to teach. At Oxford he was one of the first masters whose names have been recorded. He opened <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> there and taught without exacting fees; he is said to have supported many scholars at his own expense and to have been largely instrumental in fostering the growth of the Oxford <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. If these traditions are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and it must be confessed that they rest on the statements of later writers, it would seem more probable that they happened during the reign of Henry I, when he refused to accept the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> offered. He was certainly <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of Rochester in 1134, and it is equally certain that he was absent from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> for a notable time within the next few years, for at some date prior to 1143 he seems to have been in trouble with his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for being absent so long from his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. This appears from an undated letter of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> addressed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rochester, in which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> makes his excuses for detaining Pullen in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> "on account of the sound <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which is recognized in him." In the same letter he blames the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for seizing the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon's</a> goods, and he begs that Pullen may stay longer in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> where he is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Though Bishop Stubbs (op. cit.) has thrown <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> on the identity of this Archdeacon Robert Pullen with the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> of the same name, the statements of St. Bernard's biographer, William <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Theodoric, and the Oseney Chronicle justify the identification.

<p>While in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Pullen taught <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> with great success. Among his pupils was <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a>, who describes him as a man commended both by his life and his learning. That was in 1141 or 1142. In 1143 he is still described as <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of Rochester and in or about that year he probably went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on the invitation of <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a>, who died in September of that year, but Pullen found favour with the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/03478a.htm">Celestine II</a>, who created him a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> (Ciaconius). The Oseney chronicler, however, states that he was called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Lucius II who succeeded Celestine in 1144. Certainly it was Pope Lucius who appointed him Chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy Roman Church</a>, an office which he was discharging through 1145 and 1146. When St. Bernard's disciple, Eugenius III, became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1145 the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> wrote a letter to Cardinal Pullen begging him to console and counsel the new pontiff. As a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> Cardinal Pullen used all his influence against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> teaching of <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a>, and embodied his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in his work "Sententiarum Logicarum Libri VIII" reprinted in P.L., with the commentary prefixed to it by the <a href="../cathen/10069b.htm">Maurist</a>, Dom Hugo Mathoud, originally written for his edition, published at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1655. In this treatise he was breaking new ground, being one of the first teachers to compile a book of "Sentences," but his work was soon supplanted by that of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>. He covers a wide range of subjects, but his treatment lacks orderly arrangement, and he relies for his <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> on Scripture and reason in preference to the testimony of tradition. Taking his stand on the authority of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> decisions, he proceeds to enter on speculative discussion. The first book treats of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His attributes; the second, of the creation, of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, of the fall of man and of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>; the third, of the ancient and the new law, and of the Incarnation; the fourth, of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power, of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>; the fifth, of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, the descent of the Holy Ghost, the preaching of the Gospel, of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, confirmation, confession, and some virtues and vices. The sixth book deals with a variety of subjects, including <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, negligence, and frailty, good and bad spirits, the choirs of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, merits, and the administration of the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>; the seventh discusses the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, penance and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, its privileges and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>, continency, the contemplative and active life, and matrimony. The eighth book deals with the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">Second Advent</a>, <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, the Last Judgment and the ultimate state of the saved and the lost. The titles of some other works which remain unpublished are given by <a href="../cathen/12120a.htm">Pitts</a>: "In Apocalypsim Sancti Johannis"; "Super aliquot psalmos"; "De contemptu mundi"; "Super doctorum dictis"; "Praelectiones"; "Sermones." A <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> copy of the sermons is preserved at Lambeth Palace, and Rashdall (Dict. of Nat. Biog.) observes of them that "the sermons, which breathe a very ascetic spirit, were evidently delivered to scholars." Chevalier is certainly in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in identifying him with the Cardinal Robert who was <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal priest</a> of St. Eusebius in December, 1134. This Robert, who also held the office of Chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy Roman Church</a>, was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> in 1130, a date inconsistent with the known facts of Pullen's life.
