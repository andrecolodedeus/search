<h1>Robert White</h1>  

<p>English composer, b. about 1530; d. Nov., 1574; was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, and graduated Mus. D., at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge University</a>, 13 Dec., 1560. In March, 1561, he succeeded Dr. Tye as <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organist</a> and master of the choristers at <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, continuing in that office till 1566. He accepted a similar post at <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in 1566, and took part in the <a href="../cathen/15614b.htm">Whitsuntide</a> pageants during the years 1567-69. Such was his repute as a choir trainer that in 1570 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organist</a> and master of the choristers of <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster Abbey</a>. Though an avowed <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> he retained his post at <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster Abbey</a> from 1570 until his death. It is worth recording that during the same period, under Elizabeth, the musical services of the Chapel Royal, <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster Abbey</a> and St. Paul's Cathedral were directed by three <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, namely Farrant, White, and <a href="../cathen/15592a.htm">Westcott</a>. White made his will on 5 Nov., 1574, and in it he describes his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> Robert White as still living. He left each of the choristers four pence. The high estimation in which he was held by his contemporaries may be judged by the distich which a pupil (in 1581) inscribed in the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> score of White's "Lamentations": <blockquote> "Non ita moesta sonat plangentis verba prophetae <br>Quam sonat authoris musica moesta mei."</blockquote>

<p>Fortunately quite a large number of White compositions have survived, and of these his Latin <a href="../cathen/10600c.htm">motets</a> are sufficient to place him in the front rank of English composers of the Elizabethan epoch. His <a href="../cathen/04436a.htm">contrapuntal</a> writing is very fine, though stilted. However, his "Lamentations", set for five voices, have a flavour far in advance of his period, as also his <a href="../cathen/10600c.htm">motet</a> "Peccatum peccavit <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>" and "Regina Coeli". It is to be observed that he wrote his English anthems <em>ex officio</em>, but his Latin services reveal the full genius of White, and give him a place with <a href="../cathen/14435a.htm">Tallis</a>, <a href="../cathen/03092f.htm">Byrd</a>, <a href="../cathen/13756b.htm">Shepherd</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14466b.htm">Taverner</a>. Strange to say, though he stood so high among mid-sixteenth century musicians, his compositions were almost utterly neglected till unearthed by Dr. Burney. In recent years he has come into his own, thanks to the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Mr. Arkwright, Dr. Terry, and others. Dr. Earnest Walker regards White "fairly to be reckoned &#151; even remembering that <a href="../cathen/11421b.htm">Palestrina</a> and <a href="../cathen/09011c.htm">Lassus</a> were contemporaries &#151; as among the very greatest <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> composers of this time".
