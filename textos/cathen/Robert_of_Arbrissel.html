<h1>Robert of Arbrissel</h1>  

<p>Itinerant preacher, founder of Fontevrault, b. c. 1047 at Arbrissel (now Arbressec) near Rh&eacute;tiers, Brittany; d. at Orsan, probably 1117. Robert studied in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> during the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, perhaps under <a href="../cathen/01550b.htm">Anselm of Laon</a> and later displayed considerable <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> and place of his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> are unknown. In 1089 he was recalled to his native <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Diocese of Rennes</a> by Bishop Sylvester de la Guerche, who desired to reform his flock. As <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a>, Robert devoted himself to the suppression of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>, lay investiture, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a>, irregular <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, and to the healing of feuds. This reforming <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> aroused such enmity that upon Sylvester's death in 1093, Robert was compelled to leave the diocese. He went to Angers and there commenced ascetic practices which he continued throughout his life. In 1095 he became a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> in the forest of Craon (s.w. of Laval), living a life of severest penance in the company of Bernard, afterwards founder of the Congregation of Tiron, Vitalis, founder of Savigny, and others of considerable note. His <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, eloquence, and strong <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> attracted many followers, for whom in 1096 he founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> of La Ro&eacute;, becoming himself the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. In the same year <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> summoned him to Angers and appointed him a "preacher (<em>seminiverbus</em>, cf. <a href="../bible/act017.htm">Acts 17</a>, <a href="../bible/act018.htm">18</a>) second only to himself with orders to travel everywhere in the performance of this <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>" (Vita Baldrici).

<p>There is no evidence that Robert assisted <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban</a> to preach the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a>, for his theme was the abandonment of the world and especially poverty. Living in the utmost destitution, he addressed himself to the poor and would have his followers known only as the "poor of Christ", while the ideal he put forward was "In nakedness to follow Christ naked upon the Cross". His eloquence, heightened by his strikingly ascetic appearance, drew crowds everywhere. Those who desired to embrace the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> state under his leadership he sent to La Ro&eacute;, but the Canons objected to the number and diversity of the <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a>, and between 1097 and 1100 Robert formally resigned his abbacy, and founded Fontevrault. His disciples were of every age and condition, including even <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> and converted prostitutes. Robert continued his missionary journeys over the whole of Western <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> till the end of his life, but little is known of this period. At the Council of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, Nov., 1100, he supported the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> in <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicating</a> Philip of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> on account of his lawless union with Bertrade de Montfort; in 1110 he attended the Council of <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>. Knowledge of his approaching death <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to take steps to ensure the permanence of his foundation at <a href="../cathen/06129b.htm">Fontevrault</a>. He imposed a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of stability on his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and summoned a Chapter (September, 1116) to settle the form of government. From Hautebruy&egrave;re a <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> founded by the penitent Bertrade, he went to Orsan, another <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of Fontevrault, where he died. The "Vita Andre&aelig;" gives a detailed account of his last year of life.

<p>Robert was never <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>. The accusation made against him by <a href="../cathen/06428b.htm">Geoffrey of Vend&ocirc;me</a> of extreme indiscretion in his choice of exceptional ascetic practices (see P.L., CLVII, 182) was the source of much controversy during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Other evidence of eccentric actions on Robert's part and <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a> among his mixed followers may have helped to give rise to these rumors. The Fontevrists did everything in their power to discredit the attacks on their founder. The accusatory letters of <a href="../cathen/09637a.htm">Marbodius of Rennes</a> and <a href="../cathen/06428b.htm">Geoffrey of Vend&ocirc;me</a> were without sufficient cause declared to be forgeries and the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> Letter of Peter of Saumur was made away with, probably at the instigation of Jeanne Baptiste de Bourbon, <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Fontevrault. This natural daughter of Henry IV applied to <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> for the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> of Robert, her request being supported by <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> and Henrietta of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Both this attempt and one made about the middle of the nineteenth century failed, but Robert is usually given the title of "Blessed". The original recension of the Rule of Fontevrault no longer exists; the only surviving writing of Robert is his letter of exhortation to Ermengarde of Brittany (ed. Petigny in "Bib. de l'&eacute;cole des Chartes", 1854, V, iii).
