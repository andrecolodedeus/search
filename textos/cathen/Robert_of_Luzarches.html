<h1>Robert of Luzarches</h1>  

<p>(LUS).

<p>Born at Luzarches near Pontoise towards the end of the twelfth century; is said to have been summoned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> by <a href="../cathen/12001a.htm">Philip Augustus</a> who employed him in beautifying the city, and to have had a share in the work on Notre Dame. The real fame of this master is, however, connected with the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Notre Dame in <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>. The old <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was destroyed by fire in 1218 and Bishop Evrard de Fouilloy had it rebuilt in <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style. An inscription made in 1288 in the <a href="../cathen/08728b.htm">"labyrinth"</a> of the floor (now removed) testified that the building had begun in 1220, and names "Robert, called of Luzarches", as the architect, and as his successors, Thomas de Cormont and the latter's son. The work was completed in later centuries. Viollet-le-Duc sees a fact of great significance in the employment of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, Robert; but it is not accurate that in Romanesque times the architects were always <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, or <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; or, on the other hand, that since the Gothic period the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> relinquished the direction of church-building so entirely as is now believed. Robert was not long employed on the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Under the successor of Bishop Evrard, who apparently died in 1222, Cormont appears as the architect. Before 1240 Bishop Bernard put a choir window in the provisionally completed <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. An intended alteration of the original plan was not used in the finished building, so that the whole remains a splendid moment to Robert. In his day it was already called the "Gothic Parthenon". Gracefully built and better lighted than several of the large churches of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, there is yet, especially about the fa&#231;ade, a majestic severity. It is more spacious than Notre Dame in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and considerably larger than the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. The former is effective through its quiet simplicity, which amounts to austerity; the latter is less rich in the modelling of choir, windows, and triforium. But Robert's creation became a standard far and near, through <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and beyond, on account of the successful manner in which weight and strength are counterbalanced and of the consistently <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style. The design presents a middle aisle and two side <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a>, though the choir has five <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> has the width of seven <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a>. The choir is flanked by seven <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; that in the centre (the Lady <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>) projecting beyond the others in French style. The majestic and harmonious interior is surpassed in beauty by few <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> is about 470 ft. in length, 164 ft. in breadth (213 ft. in the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a>), and 141 ft. in height. A poet writes aptly, "Fabrica nil demi patitur nec susinet addi" (It is not possible to add anything to or to take anything from it).
