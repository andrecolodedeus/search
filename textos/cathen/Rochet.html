<h1>Rochet</h1>  

<p>An over-tunic usually made of fine white linen (cambric; fine cotton material is also allowed), and reaching to the knees. While bearing a general resemblance to the <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a>, it is distinguished from that vestment by the shape of the sleeves; in the <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a> these are at least fairly wide, while in the rochet they are always tight-fitting. The rochet is decorated with lace or <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidered</a> borders--broader at the hem and narrower on the sleeves. To make the vestment entirely of tulle or lace is inconvenient, as is the inordinate use of plaits; in both cases, the vestment becomes too effeminate. The rochet is not a vestment pertaining to all <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, like the <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a>; it is distinctive of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, and may be worn by other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> only when (as, e.g., in the case of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters) the <em>usus rochetti</em> has been granted them by a special <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">papal indult</a>. That the rochet possesses no <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> character is clear both from the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/15218a.htm">Urban VII</a> prefixed to the Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, and from an express decision of the Congregation of Rites (10 Jan., 1852), which declares that, in the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, the rochet may not be used as a <em>vestis sacra;</em> in the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, as well as at the conferring of the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, use should be made of the <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a> (<em>cf.</em> the decision of 31 May, 1817; 17 Sept., 1722; 16 April, 1831). However, as the rochet may be used by the properly privileged <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as choir-dress, it may be included among the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments in the broad sense, like the <a href="../cathen/02577a.htm">biretta</a> or the <em>cappa magna</em>. Prelates who do not belong to a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, should wear the rochet over the soutane during Mass in so far as this is convenient.

<p>The origin of the rochet may be traced from the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> (non- <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a>) <em>alba</em> or <em>camisia,</em> that is, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> linen tunic of everyday life. It was thus not originally distinctive of the higher <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> alone. This <em>camisia</em> appears first in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as a privileged vestment; that this was the case in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> capital as early as the ninth century is established by the St. Gall catalogue of vestments. Outside of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the rochet remained to a great extent a vestment common to all <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> until the fourteenth century (and even longer); according to various German synodal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries (Trier, <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a>, <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, etc.), it was worn even by <a href="../cathen/13322a.htm">sacristans</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> prescribed its use for <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who did not belong to a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, both in the church and on all public appearances. The name rochet (from the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <em>roccus</em>) was scarcely in use before the thirteenth century. It is first met outside of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where, until the fifteenth century, the vestment was called <em>camisia, alba romana,</em> or <em>succa (subta)</em>. These names gradually yielded to rochet in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> also. Originally, the rochet reached, like the <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">liturgical alb</a>, to the feet, and, even in the fifteenth century still reached to the shins. It was not reduced to its present length until the seventeenth century.
