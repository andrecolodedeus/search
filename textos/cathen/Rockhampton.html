<h1>Rockhampton</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in Queensland, Australia. In 1862 Father Duhig visited the infant settlement on the banks of the Fitzroy River and celebrated the first Mass there. Father Scully came from <a href="../cathen/02789b.htm">Brisbane</a> to attend to the spiritual needs of the little congregation and in 1863 Dean Murlay was appointed first resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Rockhampton, his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> extending as far north as Cooktown and south to Maryborough. He built the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church in Rockhampton, a wooden edifice still standing, and for many years was the only <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to look after the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> scattered over the vast territory. A foundation of the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> from All-Hallows Convent, <a href="../cathen/02789b.htm">Brisbane</a>, was established in 1873, and Sister Mary de Sales Gorry, the first Queensland-born <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>, was appointed Superioress. Rockhampton remained part of the Diocese of Brisbane until 1882. In 1876 the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> erected the northern portion of the colony into a pro-vicariate, and in 1882 made Rockhampton a see with a territory of some 350,000 square miles. Right Rev. Dr. Cani, a native of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">papal states</a>, who had had a distinguished scholastic career at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and former pro-vicar Apostolic of North Queensland, was appointed first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the new diocese. Bishop Cani, who was then administering the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/02789b.htm">Brisbane</a>, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/15315a.htm">Archbishop Vaughan</a> in St. Mary's Cathedral, <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a>, 21 May, 1882, and was installed in his temporary <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Rockhampton on 11 June following.

<p>In the new diocese there were about 10,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 6 or 7 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 8 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>. Bishop Cani added to the small number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, purchased sites for new churches, and acquired 3000 acres of fertile land near Rockhampton for a central <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> which he had built and placed under the care of the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>. His great work was the erection of St. Joseph's Cathedral, a magnificent stone edifice which he did not live to see dedicated. After a strenuous episcopate of sixteen years Dr. Cani died, 3 March, 1898. His great virtues were recognized even by those outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Humility and simplicity of life, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the poor and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> were his special characteristics. He was succeeded in Rockhampton by Right Rev. Dr. Higgins, a native of Co. Meath, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and now <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02223a.htm">Ballarat</a>. Dr. Higgins studied in Maynooth, was subsequently president of the Diocesan <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Navan, and in 1888 was chosen <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a> with the title of <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Antifelle. He had <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> laboured in the <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Archdiocese of Sydney</a> for over ten years, when appointed to Rockhampton. He traversed his new diocese from end to end, gauged its wants, attracted <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to his aid, placed students for the mission in various <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> colleges, introduced new religious teaching orders, built and dedicated churches, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in several centres, bringing the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> of religion and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> to the children of the backblocks.

<p>On 15 October, 1899, the beautiful new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was dedicated by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a> assisted by several other distinguished Australian <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> in the presence of a great concourse of people. The remains of Dr. Cani were transferred thither. Dr. Higgins visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in 1904, and returned with renewed energy to carry on his great work. On the death of Dr. Moore, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02223a.htm">Ballarat</a>, <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a>, he was translated to that important See, where he has ever since laboured with characteristic <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and devotedness. The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rockhampton is Right Rev. Dr. James Duhig, born at Broadford, Co. Limerick, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 1870. Dr. Duhig <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> with his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> at the age of thirteen, studied with the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> at <a href="../cathen/02789b.htm">Brisbane</a> and at the <a href="../cathen/08157a.htm">Irish College</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 19 Sept., 1896, and, returning to Queensland in the following year, was appointed to a curacy in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Ipswich. In 1905 he was appointed administrator of St. Stephen's Cathedral, <a href="../cathen/02789b.htm">Brisbane</a>, and received the briefs of his appointment to the See of Rockhampton. At present (1911) there are in the Diocese of Rockhampton: about 28,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; 19 missions or districts; 30 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (4 of whom belong to the Marist congregation, who have 1 house in the diocese); 12 <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>; 150 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>; and 26 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, attended by about 5000 children.
