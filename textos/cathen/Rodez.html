<h1>Rodez</h1>  

<p>(RUTHENAE)

<p>The Diocese of Rodez was united to the <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Diocese of Cahors</a> by the Concordat of 1802, and again became an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> by the Concordat of 1817 and <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 1822, having <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over: (1) the ancient Diocese of Rodez with the exception of the deanery of Saint Antonin, incorporated with the <a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">Diocese of Montauban</a>; (2) the ancient Diocese of Vabres; (3) a few scattered communes of the <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Diocese of Cahors</a>. The Diocese of Rodez corresponds exactly to the Department of Aveyron (formerly Rouergue). It was suffragan of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a> until 1676, then of <a href="../cathen/01267a.htm">Albi</a>, and has again been suffragan of Aibi since 1822. Modern tradition attributes to <a href="../cathen/09721c.htm">St. Martial</a> the foundation of the church of Rodez and the sanctuary of the Blessed Virgin at Ceignac, for according to Cardinal Bourret, the church of Rodez <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> <a href="../cathen/09721c.htm">St. Martial</a> as early as the sixth century (see Limoges). There were <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Rodez before 675, as Sidonius Apollinaris mentions that the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> left it at that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> without <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Amantius, who ruled about the end of the fifth century, is the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> mentioned. Among others are: S. Quintianua who assisted at the Councils of <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Agde</a> (508) and Orl&eacute;ans (511), afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a>; 8. Dalmatius (524-80); S. Gausbert (tenth century), probably a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a>; Jean de Cardaillac (1371-9); <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>, who fought against English rule; Blessed Francis d'Estaing (1501-29), ambassador of Louis XII to Juluis II; Louis Avelly (1664-6) who wrote the life of St. Vincent of Paul; Joseph Bourret (1871-96), made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> in 1893. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Vabres, founded in 862 by Raymond I, Count of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, was raised to episcopal rank in 1317, and its <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> territory was taken from the southeastern portion of the Diocese of Rodez. Some scholars hold that within the limits of the modern Diocese of Rodez there existed in Merovingian times the See of Arisitum which, according to Mgr Duchesne, was in the neighbourhood of Alais.

<p>During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rodez held temporal dominion over that portion of the town known as the <em>Cit&eacute;</em> while in the eleventh century the <em>Bourg</em> became the County of Rodez. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Rodez (thirteenth and fourteenth centuries) is a beautiful Gothic building, famous for its <a href="../cathen/02394d.htm">belfry</a> (1510-26) and unique rood-beam. It was spared during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> for dedication to Marat. The town of Milhau adopted <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> in 1534, and in 1573 and 1620 was the scene of two large assemblies of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> deputies. In 1629 Milhau and Saint-Afrique, another <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> stronghold, were taken and dismantled by Louis XIII. In 1628 a pest at Villefranche carried off 8000 inhabitants within six months; Father Ambroise, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, and the chief of police Jean de Pomayrol saved the lives of many little children by causing them to be suckled by goats. The <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbeys of Silban&egrave;s, Beaulieu, Loc-Dieu, Bonneval, and Bonnecombe were model-farms during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Attacked by brigands in the Rouergue country on his way to Santiago di Compostella, Adalard, Viscount of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, erected in 1031 a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> known as the Domerie d'Aubrac, a special order of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, ladies, and lay sisters for the care and protection of travellers. At Milhau, Rodez, Nazac, <em>and</em> Bozouls, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, styled "Commanderies", of this order of Aubrac adopted the rule of St. Augustine in 1162.

<p>The Diocese of Rodez is famous also through the Abbey of Conques and the cult of Sainte Foy. Some <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, flying from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> about 730, sought a refuge in the "Val Rocheux" of the Dourdou and built an oratory there. In 790 the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> Dadon made this his abode and aided by Louis the Pious, then King of Aquitaine, founded an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, which Louis named Conques. In 838 Pepin, King of Aquitaine, gave the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Figeac to Conques. Between 877 and 883 the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> carried off the body of the youthful <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Ste-Foy from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Sainte Foy to Conques, where it became the object of a great <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>. Abbot Odolric built the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church between 1030 and 1060; on the stonework over the doorway is carved the most artistic representation in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> of the Last Judgment. Abbot Begon (1099-1118) enriched Conques with a superb <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> of beaten gold and cloisonne's enamels of a kind extremely rare in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. <a href="../cathen/11514b.htm">Pascal II</a> gave him permission for the name of Ste-Foy to be inserted in the Canon of the Mass after the names of the Roman virgins. At this time Conques, with Agen and Schelestadt in Alsace, was the centre of the cult of Ste. Foy which soon spread to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and America where many towns bear the name of <a href="../cathen/13457a.htm">Santa Fe</a>. The statute of Ste-Foy seated, which dated from the tenth century, was originally a small wooden one covered with gold leaf. In time, gems, enamels, and precious stones were added in such quantities that it is a living treatise on the history of the goldsmiths art in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> between the eleventh and sixteenth centuries. It was known during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> as "Majest&eacute; de Sainte Foy". The shrine enclosing the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the Saint, which in 1590 was hidden in the masonry connecting the pillars of the choir, was found in 1875, repaired, transferred to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Rodez for a novena, and brought back to Conques, a distance of 25 miles, on the shoulders of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>.

<p>Among Saints specially <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in the Diocese of Rodez and Vabres are: S. Antoninus of <a href="../cathen/11435b.htm">Pamiers</a>, Apostle of the Rouergue (date uncertain); S. Gratus and S. Ansutus, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> (fourth century); S. Naamatius, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and confessor (end of fifth century); Ste. Tarsicia, grand-daughter of Clothaire I and of Ste-Radegunda, who retired to the Rouergue to lead an ascetic life (sixth century); S. Africanus, wrongly styled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Comminges, who died in the Rouergue (sixth century); S. Hilarianus, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> in the time of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> (eighth and ninth century); S. George, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in the Diocese of Vabres, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lod&egrave;ve (877); 8. Guasbert, founder and first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Montsalvy in the modern Diocese of St. Flour (eleventh century). Among natives of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: Cardinal Bernard of Milhau, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Victor's at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> in 1063, and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>; Theodatus de Gozon (d. 1353) and John of La Valetta (1494-1568), grand masters of the <a href="../cathen/07477a.htm">order of St. John of Jerusalem</a>; the former is famous for his victory over the dragon of <a href="../cathen/13024b.htm">Rhodes</a>, the latter for his heroic defence of <a href="../cathen/09574a.htm">Malta</a>; Frassinous (1765-1841), preacher and minister of worship under the Restoration; Bonald (1754-1840) and Laromigui&egrave;re (1736-1837), <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>; <a href="../cathen/01180a.htm">Affre</a> (1793-1848), born at St. Rome de Tarn and slain at the Barricades as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The chief shrines of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: Notre Dame de Ceignac, an ancient shrine rebuilt and enlarged in 1455, which over 15,000 <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> visit annually; Notre Dame du Saint Voile at Coupiac, another ancient shrine; Notre Dame des Treize Pierres at Villefranche, a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from 1509.

<p>Before the application of the Associations' Law in 1901, there were in the Diocese of Rodez, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a>, P&egrave;res Blancs, <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>, Fathers of Picpus, <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, Clerics of St. Victor, and many congregations of teaching brothers. This diocese furnishes more missionaries than any other in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Of the numerous congregations for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> which had their origin there, the principal are: affiliations of the Sisters of St. Francis of Sales, known as the Union, teaching orders founded in 1672, 1698, 1739, 1790, with mother-houses at St-Geniez, d'Olt, Bozouls, Lavernhe, Auzits; the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, founded in 1682 for teaching and district nursing, with mother-house at Marcillac, and other sisters of the same name, united in 1822, 1824, 1856, with mother-houses at Milhau, Villecomtal, Salles-la-Source; the Sisters of the Holy Family, a teaching and nursing order, founded in 1816 by Emilie de Rodat, with mother-house at Villefranche and many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> throughout the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; the Minim Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Mary founded in 1844 by Mile.
