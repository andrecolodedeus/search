<h1>Roermond</h1>  

<p>(RUBAEMUNDENSIS).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>; suffragan of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>. It includes the Province of <a href="../cathen/09260a.htm">Limburg</a>, and in 1909 had 332,201 inhabitants, among whom were 325,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter with 9 canons, 14 deaneries, 173 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 197 churches with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, an <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> at Roermond, a preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for boys at <a href="../cathen/13118c.htm">Rolduc</a>, about 70 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 2 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> preparatory <em>gymnasia</em>, 1 training college for male teachers, 24 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, and classical studies, 35 higher <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls, about 60 <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>, 45 houses of religious (men) with about 2400 members, and 130 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> with 3900 sisters. Among the orders and congregations of men in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">Society of the Divine Word</a> of Steyl, Brothers of the Immaculate Conception, <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a>, Reformed <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>, Brothers of Mercy, Poor Brothers of St. Francis, <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a>, Calced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, Missionaries of Africa, Priests of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, Brothers of the Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Brothers of St. Francis, Brothers of St. Joseph, the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Society of Mary</a>, the Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Congregation of the Divine Spirit, and the Congregation of Missions. Among the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> orders and congregations are: <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/02785a.htm">Brigittines</a>, <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, <a href="../cathen/10201a.htm">Sisters of St. Charles Borromeo</a>, Sisters of Tilburg, Sisters of the Child Jesus, Sisters of St. Francis, Sisters of the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> etc.

<p>The Diocese of Roermond was established in 1559, during the reign of Philip II, when after long and difficult negotiations with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> were reorganized. By these negotiations all <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of foreign <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, e.g. that of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, came to an end. In this way the Diocese of Roermond, the boundaries of which were settled in 1561, became a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>. The reorganization of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, however, met with violent opposition, partly from <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to whose territories the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> had formerly belonged, partly from a number of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> whose <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> were incorporated in the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>. Much difficulty was also caused by the rapid growth of <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. In Roermond the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Lindanus, who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1563, could not enter upon his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> until 1569; notwithstanding his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and charitableness he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to retire on account of the revolutionary movement; he died <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> until 1591; at later periods also, on account of the political turmoils, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was repeatedly vacant. In 1801 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was suppressed; the last <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Johann Baptist Baron van Velde de Melroy, died in 1824.

<p>When in 1839 the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/09260a.htm">Limburg</a> became once more a part of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> separated (2 June, 1840) that part of <a href="../cathen/09260a.htm">Limburg</a> which had been incorporated in the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> in 1802, and added to this territory several new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> which had formerly belonged to the <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Diocese of Aachen</a>, and formed thus the Vicariate Apostolic of Roermond, over which the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Roermond, Johann August Paredis, was placed as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> and <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Hirene. In 1841 a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> was established in the former <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Roermond, where the celebrated <a href="../cathen/04734a.htm">Dionysius the Carthusian</a> had been a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. Upon the re-establishment of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in 1853 the Vicariate-Apostolic of Roermond was raised to a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> and made a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was Paredis. In 1858 a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter was formed; in 1867 a synod was held, the first since 1654; in 1876 the administration of the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> was transferred, by <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. During the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> a number of ecclesiastical dignitaries driven out of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> found a hospitable welcome and opportunities for further usefulness in the Diocese of Roermond; among these <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchmen</a> were <a href="../cathen/10156a.htm">Melchers</a> of Cologne, Brinkmann of Munster, and Martin of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>. Bishop Paredis was succeeded by Franziskus Boreman (1886-1900), on whose death the present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Joseph Hubertus Drehmann, was appointed.
