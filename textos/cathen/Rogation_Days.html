<h1>Rogation Days</h1>  

<p>Days of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and formerly also of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, instituted by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to appease <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> at man's transgressions, to ask protection in calamities, and to obtain a good and bountiful harvest, known in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> as "Gang Days" and "Cross Week", and in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> as <em>Bittage, Bittwoche, Kreuzwoche</em>. The Rogation Days were highly esteemed in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/01309d.htm">King Alfred's</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> considered a theft committed on these days equal to one committed on Sunday or a higher Church Holy Day. Their celebration continued even to the thirteenth year of Elizabeth, 1571, when one of the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the Established Church inveighed against the Rogation processions, or Gang Days, of Cross Week. The ceremonial may be found in the Council of Clovesho (Thorpe, Ancient Laws, I, 64; Hefele, Conciliengeschichte, III, 564).

<p>The Rogation Days are the 25th of April, called Major, and the three days before the <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">feast of the Ascension</a>, called Minor. The Major Rogation, which has no connexion with the feast of St. Mark (fixed for this date much later) seems to be of very early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> and to have been introduced to counteract the ancient <em>Robigalia</em>, on which the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> held processions and supplications to their gods. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> (d. 604) regulated the already existing custom. The Minor Rogations were introduced by <a href="../cathen/09580a.htm">St. Mamertus</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vienne, and were afterwards ordered by the Fifth Council of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, which was held in 511, and then approved by <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Leo III</a> (795-816). This is asserted by <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a> in "Hist. Franc.", II, 34, by <a href="../cathen/02161c.htm">St. Avitus</a> of Vienne in his "Hom. de Rogat." (P.L., LVIII, 563), by <a href="../cathen/01145b.htm">Ado of Vienne</a> (P.L., CXXIII, 102), and by the Roman Martyrology. Sassi, in "Archiepiscopi Mediolanenses", ascribes their introduction at an earlier date to St. Lazarus. This is also held by the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandist</a> <a href="../cathen/07240a.htm">Henschen</a> in "Acta SS.", II, Feb., 522. The <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> celebration now consists in the procession and the Rogation Mass. For 25 April the Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> gives the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a>: "If the feast of St. Mark is transferred, the procession is not transferred. In the rare case of 25 April being <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a> [1886, 1943], the procession is held not on Sunday but on the Tuesday following".

<p>The order to be observed in the procession of the Major and Minor Rogation is given in the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a>, title X, ch. iv. After the antiphon "Exurge Domine", the <a href="../cathen/09291a.htm">Litany of the Saints</a> is chanted and each verse and response is said twice. After the verse "Sancta Maria" the procession begins to move. If <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> may be repeated, or some of the Penitential or <a href="../cathen/06718a.htm">Gradual Psalms</a> added. For the Minor Rogations the "Ceremoniale Episcoporum", book II, ch. xxxii, notes: "Eadem serventur sed aliquid remissius". If the procession is held, the Rogation Mass is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>, and no notice is taken of whatever feast may occur, unless only one Mass is said, for then a commemoration is made of the feast. An exception is made in favour of the patron or titular of the church, of whom the Mass is said with a commemoration of the Rogation. The colour used in the procession and Mass is violet. The <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> gives the instruction: "All <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> bound to recite the Office, and who are not present at the procession, are bound to recite the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">Litany</a>, nor can it be anticipated".
