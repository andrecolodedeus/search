<h1>Roger William Vaughan</h1>  

<p>(B<font size=-2>EDE</font>).

<p>Second <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a>, b. at Courtfield, Herefordshire, 9 January, 1834; d. at Ince-Blundell Hall, Lancashire, 17 August, 1883. He was the second son of Colonel John Vaughan and Eliza his first wife, and was thus the younger brother of <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>. Being delicate he was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at home under the influence of his saintly mother till he was seventeen, when he went to Downside. There he decided to become a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, and, in 1855, having finished his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, he was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he studied at the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> house of St. Paul-Outside-the-Walls. A year after his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> (1859) he returned to Downside, where he took charge of the mission. In November, 1861, he became professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and, a year later, <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> prior at St. Michael's Priory, Belmont, a post which he held till 1872. While at Belmont he wrote his great work, "The Life and Labours of St. Thomas Aquinas" (London, 1871-2; 2nd ed., 1890). In 1872 he was chosen as coadjutor to <a href="../cathen/12201a.htm">Archbishop Polding</a> of <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a>, an event which justified the premonition he always had that he was destined to work in <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10728c.htm">Nazianzus</a> by <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Archbishop Manning</a> at <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, on 19 March, 1872, and during the summer sailed for Australia. Five years later, on <a href="../cathen/12201a.htm">Dr. Polding's</a> death (16 March, 1877), he succeeded him as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a>. The remaining six years were devoted to apostolic work, especially preaching, in which he was indefatigable in spite of the strain on a constitution never strong. He <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a capable administrator, fighting energetically for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests, especially those of primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, which he provided for by the foundation of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. He also took great interest in the completion of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> which he lived to open. He was a man of great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and so far as possible continued even when <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> to lead the life of a simple <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. While visiting <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> for the sake of his health he died suddenly at his uncle's house.
