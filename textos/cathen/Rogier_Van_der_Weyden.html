<h1>Rogier Van der Weyden</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">Painter</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, 1399 or 1400; d. at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, 1464. His original name was De la Pasture, which was transformed in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> into Van der Weyden. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, settled in Tournai since 1260, were people of means. He is believed to have commenced his artistic life as a goldsmith, and his figures show that he understood some kind of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>. He was apprenticed to Robert Campin in 1427, became a master <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, was admitted into the <a href="../cathen/07066c.htm">Guild</a> of St. Luke in 1432, and three years later was <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> in ordinary to the municipality of <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>. He only had the appointment, however, for a year, when the office of town <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> was abolished. He was said to have been a pupil of <a href="../cathen/05732a.htm">van Eyck</a>, e.g. by <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> and other writers, but the researches of Weale in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> documents <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> this incorrect, and showed that Campin was Rogier's master. His work is far more religious than that of <a href="../cathen/05732a.htm">van Eyck</a>, and the figures in his pictures much more dramatic, animated, and at times almost tragic. He was full of employment and obtained high prices. He lived at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, and had four children, Cornelius, who became a <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a>, Peter, who was a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, John, who was a goldsmith, and one daughter, Margaret. He was a generous benefactor, especially to <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> houses. One of his important altar-pieces, now in <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> for the Cartuja of Miraflores in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, another, now in the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> house at Scheut, a third, at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, who desired to give it to a <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> house, and a fourth for the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Herinnes, where Cornelius resided. The "Joys and Sorrows of our Lady of Pity", now at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, the "Seven Sacraments", at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, the "Adoration of the Magi", at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, and the marvellous triptych in the Prado, are his greatest works. There are also <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by him at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> and <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and others attributed to him elsewhere.
