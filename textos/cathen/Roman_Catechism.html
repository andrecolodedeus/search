<h1>Roman Catechism</h1>  

<p>This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> differs from other summaries of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> for the instruction of the people in two points: it is primarily intended for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> having care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> (<em>ad parochos</em>), and it enjoys an authority equalled by no other <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>. The need of a popular authoritative manual arose from a lack of systematic <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> among pre-Reformation <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the concomitant neglect of religious instruction among the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> had not been slow in taking advantage of the situation; their popular tracts and catechisms were flooding every country and leading thousands of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> away from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The Fathers of <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>, therefore, "wishing to apply a salutary remedy to this great and pernicious <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and thinking that the definition of the principal <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrines</a> was not enough for the purpose, resolved also to publish a formulary and method for teaching the rudiments of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to be used by all legitimate <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and teachers" (Cat. praef., vii). This resolution was taken in the eighteenth session (26 February, 1562) on the suggestion of <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>; who was then giving full scope to his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the reformation of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> entrusted the composition of the Catechism to four distinguished <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>: <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> Leonardo Marino of Lanciano and Muzio Calini of <a href="../cathen/15752a.htm">Zara</a>, Egidio Foscarini, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>, and Francisco Fureiro, a Portuguese <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>. Three <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> were appointed to supervise the work. <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> superintended the redaction of the original Italian text, which, thanks to his exertions, was finished in 1564. <a href="../cathen/14027a.htm">Cardinal William Sirletus</a> then gave it the final touches, and the famous Humanists, Julius Pogianus and Paulus Manutius, translated it into classical Latin. It was then published in Latin and Italian as "Catechismus ex decreto Concilii Tridentini ad parochos Pii V jussu editus, Romae, 1566" (in-folio). Translations into the vernacular of every nation were ordered by the Council (Sess. XXIV, "De Ref.", c. vii).

<p>The Council intended the projected Catechism to be the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> official manual of popular instruction. The seventh canon, "De Reformatione", of Sess. XXIV, runs: "That the faithful may approach the Sacraments with greater reverence and devotion, the Holy Synod charges all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> about to administer them to explain their operation and use in a way adapted to the understanding of the people; to see, moreover, that their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> observe the same rule piously and prudently, making use for their explanations, where <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and convenient, of the vernacular tongue; and conforming to the form to be prescribed by the Holy Synod in its instructions (<em>catechesis</em>) for the several Sacraments: the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> shall have these instructions carefully translated into the vulgar tongue and explained by all <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to their flocks . . .". In the mind of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the Catechism, though primarily written for the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, was also intended to give a fixed and stable scheme of instruction to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, especially with regard to the means of grace, so much neglected at the time. To attain this object the work closely follows the dogmatic definitions of the council. It is divided in four parts: <blockquote> I. The <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a>; <br>II. The Sacraments; <br>III. The <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a>; <br>IV. <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a>, especially The <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>. </blockquote>

<p>It deals with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> primacy and with Limbo, points which were not discussed or defined at <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>; on the other hand, it is silent on the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a>, which is set forth in the "Decretum de indulgentiis", Sess. XXV. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> urged in every way the use of the new Catechism; they enjoined its frequent reading, so that all its contents would be committed to memory; they exhorted the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to discuss parts of it at their meetings, and insisted upon its being used for instructing the people.

<p>To some editions of the Roman Catechism is prefixed a "Praxis Catechismi", i.e. a division of its contents into sermons for every <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of the year adapted to the Gospel of the day. There is no better sermonary. The people like to hear the voice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> speaking with no uncertain sound; the many Biblical texts and illustrations go straight to their hearts, and, best of all, they remember these simple sermons better than they do the oratory of famous <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> orators. The Catechism has not of course the authority of conciliary definitions or other primary symbols of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for, although decreed by the Council, it was only published a year after the Fathers had dispersed, and it consequently lacks a formal conciliary <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>. During the heated controversies <em>de auxiliis gratiae</em> between the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> and <a href="../cathen/10437a.htm">Molinists</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> refused to accept the authority of the Catechism as decisive. Yet it possesses high authority as an exposition of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>. It was composed by order of a council, issued and approved by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; its use has been prescribed by numerous <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> throughout the whole Church; Leo XIII, in a letter to the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (8 Sept., 1899), recommended the study of the Roman Catechism to all seminarians, and the reigning pontiff, <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, has signified his desire that preachers should expound it to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>.

<p>The earliest editions of the Roman Catechism are: "Romae apud Paulum Manutium", 1566; "Venetiis, apud Dominicum de Farris&ouml;, 1567; "Coloniae", 1567 (by Henricus Aquensis); "Parisuis, in aedibus. Jac. Kerver", 1568; "Venetiis, apud Aldum", 1575; Ingolstadt, 1577 (Sartorius). In 1596 appeared at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> "Cat. Romanus . . . quaestionibus distinctus, brevibusque exhortatiunculis studio Andreae Fabricii, Leodiensis". (This editor, A. Le Fevre, died in 1581. He probably made this division of the Roman Catechism into questions and answers in 1570). George Eder, in 1569, arranged the Catechism for the use of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. He distributed the main doctrines into sections and subsections, and added perspicuous tables of contents. This useful work bears the title: "Methodus Catechismi Catholici". The first known English translation is by Jeremy Donovan, a professor at <a href="../cathen/10087b.htm">Maynooth</a>, published by Richard Coyne, Capel Street, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, and by Keating &amp; Brown, London, and printed for the translator by W. Folds &amp; Son, Great Shand Street, 1829. An American edition appeared in the same year. Donovan's translation was reprinted at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> Press, in two volumes (1839); it is dedicated to Cardinal Fransoni, and signed: "Jeremias Donovan, sacerdos hibernus, cubicularius Gregorii XVI, P. M." There is another English translation by R.A. Buckley (London, 1852), which is more elegant than Donovan's and claims to be more correct but is spoiled by the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> notes of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> translator. The first German translation, by Paul Hoffaeus, is dated Dillingen, 1568.
