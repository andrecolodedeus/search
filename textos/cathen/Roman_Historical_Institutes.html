<h1>Roman Historical Institutes</h1>  

<p>Collegiate bodies established at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> or <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> for the purpose of historical research, notably in the <a href="../cathen/15276b.htm">Vatican</a> <a href="../cathen/01696a.htm">archives</a>.
<h2 id="section1">The earliest scientific uses of the Vatican Archives</h2>

<p>In purely business matters or those of a political or diplomatic nature, the Roman <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> have always relied on the material abundantly stored up in their archives. A glance at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> "Regesta" of the thirteenth century shows occasional reference to documents formerly kept in the archives, but which had been lost. In time these references multiply and point to a constant official intercourse between the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> and the keepers of the Apostolic archives. It is rare that such references disclose a purely scientific interest, and then only when foreign authorities inquire after documents that would facilitate domestic researches on given topics. Then, as now, it was the official <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the personnel of the archives to attend to all such matters. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the awakening critical investigation of the past led some scholars to resort to the rich treasures of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> archives, and they were always treated with the utmost courtesy. The most far-reaching and efficient use of the archives for historical purposes began with C&aelig;sar <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, later <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, and author of the well-known monumental work on <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>, undertaken at the instance of St. Philip Ned, "Annales ecclesiastici a Christo nato ad annum 1198", in twelve folio volumes (Rome, 1588-1593). Through this work, and in the several continuations of it by others, the world first learned of the great wealth of historical documents contained in the Roman archives, and especially in the archives of the Vatican. The extensive "Bullaria", or compilations of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> decrees, general and particular (see <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">BULLS AND BRIEFS</a>), are drawn in part from the archives of the recipients, but could never have reached their imposing array of volumes had not the Vatican furnished abundant material.

<p>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, ecclesiastical historians and the writers of the almost countless monographs (some of them very valuable) concerning local churches, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions, etc. were greatly aided by the officials of the archives, themselves often scholarly investigators. In this respect the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> archivist, <a href="../cathen/14565b.htm">Augustin Theiner</a> (1804-74) accomplished very far-reaching work, of great service to certain <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> countries or groups of countries, when he published, in many folio volumes, a multitude of documents relative to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and civil history of Northern, Eastern, and Southern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, also a documentary treatise in three folio volumes on the temporal dominion of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and its administration. In the same period, i.e. from about 1850 to 1875, several other investigators, chiefly German and Austrian, in one way or another secured admittance to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> archives. These events and other influences increased the desire of all scholars for the opening of this valuable repository of important historical documents. Although under <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> it became somewhat easier to obtain a permit for private research, the turbulent political conditions of his reign forbade anything like a general opening of the Vatican Archives.
<h2 id="section2">Opening of the Vatican Archives</h2>

<p>"We have nothing to fear from the publication of documents", exclaimed <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, when on 20 June, 1879, he appointed the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical historian</a>, <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Joseph Hergenr&ouml;ther</a>, "Cardinal Archivist of the Holy Roman Church" (Palmieri, "Introite ed Esiti di Papa Niccol&ograve; III", <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, pp. xiv, xv; Friedensburg, "Das kgl. Preussische Historische Institut in Rom", <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 1903, <em>passim</em>). By this act he opened to students the archives of the Vatican, more especially what are known as the secret archives, despite strong opposition from several quarters. It took until the beginning of 1881 to arrange all preliminaries, including the preparation of suitable quarters for the work, after which date the barriers were removed which, until then, with a few exceptions, had shut out all investigators. The use of these treasures was at length regularized by a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> (<em>regolamento</em>) of 1 May, 1884, whereby this important matter was finally removed from the province of discussion. In the meantime the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had addressed to the three <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, Pitra, De Luca, and <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a>, his now famous letter on historical studies (18 Aug., 1883).
<h2 id="section3">Scientific research in the Secret Archives</h2>

<p>Hitherto very little was known of the contents of this vast treasury; now its great wealth came to be widely appreciated &mdash; Briefs, <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>, petitions, department records, reports of <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a> and other reports, diaries, documentary collections, privileges, legal titles of the most miscellaneous kind, etc. Progress was at first rather slow, for no systematic use of the archives could be planned until the workers had familiarized themselves with the material at hand. The over-hasty treatment that, in the beginning, the thirteenth century material received, revealed quite clearly how much there was to learn before the archives could be used to the best advantage. Gradually, however, good order was introduced in all kinds of research work, in which task notable services were rendered by the historical institutes which from time to time were established in close relation to the Vatican Archives. Research work in these archives may be divided into individual and collective, or general and special. Individual researches are made by individual scholars, while collective work is conducted by several who have either united for that purpose, or belong permanently to some association. General research devotes itself to the larger outlines of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>, while special research seeks the solution of particular problems, more or less far-reaching in importance. Both methods may be combined, objectively and subjectively; an individual investigator may work at a general theme, while an association may take up the study of a restricted or specific problem, and vice versa. The results of Vatican historical study are to be found in periodicals, essays, and books, also disseminated in large historical collections devoted to other classes of historical material, and containing the results of other investigations, e.g. the "Monumenta Germani&aelig; Historica". A study of the published material exhibits long series of original documents, narratives based on copious documentary material, and occasionally narratives based on information obtained in the archives, but unaccompanied by the documents or by reference to them.
<h2 id="section4">Field of investigation</h2>

<p>While it is but natural that the study of documents should be chiefly done in the Vatican archives, most investigators also carry on work in the important collection of printed books known as the Vatican Library. In October, 1892, there was opened in connexion with the archives and the Library a consultation <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, the "Bibliotheca Leoniana", in order to facilitate research, historical and Biblical. Governments, academies, <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>, archives, and corporations contributed to it, and it has already reached very large proportions. The archives themselves are so organized that nearly every student of history may discover there something of special importance in his own province. The numerous other archives and manuscript-collections of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> are also open, as a rule, to the student; indeed, few workers limit themselves exclusively to Vatican materials. Moreover, studies begun in the Vatican are often supplemented by scientific excursions to other Italian cities, either on the student's homeward journey or during some vacation period; such excursions have at times resulted in surprising discoveries. An exhaustive examination of Italian archives and <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> leads occasionally to a larger view of the subject than was originally intended by the investigator, for whom in this way new questions of importance spring up, the definite solution of which becomes highly desirable. Experience, therefore, and the detailed study of the numerous repertories, indexes, and inventories of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, have made it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to organize permanently the scientific historical researches carried on in the interest of any given country. This means a saving of money and of labour; in this way also more substantial achievements can be hoped for than from purely individual research. Consequently, institutes for historical research were soon founded in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, somewhat on the plan of the earlier arch&aelig;ological <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. While the opening of such institutes is a <em>nobile offlcium</em> of any government, private associations have made serious <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> in the same direction and sustained with success the institutes they have called into life. The state institutes investigate all that pertains to national relations or intercourse (religion, politics, economics, <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, or art) with the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>, with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, or, for that matter, with <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Many of these institutes do not attempt to go further, and their field is certainly comprehensive and in itself admirable. Others devote themselves to similar researches, but do not neglect general questions of interest to universal history, profane or <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>, or to the history of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> culture. Of course, only the larger institutes, with many workers at their disposal, can satisfactorily undertake problems of this nature.


<h2 id="section5">Historical institutes at the Vatican Archives</h2>
<h3>England</h3>

<p>At the end of 1876 the Rev. Joseph Stevenson, who was employed by the English Public Record Office to obtain transcripts of documents of historical importance in the Vatican archives, resigned his appointment, and Sir Thomas Hardy, on <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning's</a> recommendation, appointed the late Mr. W. H. Bliss as his successor. Though for years Stevenson and Bliss conducted their researches alone, in the last decade other English investigators, chiefly younger men, had been detailed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the home Government to co-operate with Bliss and hasten the progress of his work. Bliss died very suddenly of pneumonia, at an advanced age, 8 March, 1909, and though his place has not yet been filled by the English Government, English investigators continue the work, under direction of the Record Office; they strictly confine themselves, however, to the search for English documents. Scientific use of this material was not called for, and was therefore not undertaken. Short r&eacute;sum&eacute;s were provided in English of the contents of the documents in question, so as to facilitate the widest possible use to those who had not sufficient mastery of Latin and Italian. So far there have appeared: "Calendars of Entries in the Papal Registers relating to Great Britain and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>:" <ul><li>I. "Papal Letters" (London, since 1892 seven volumes to date, the eighth in course of preparation); <li>II. "Petitions to the Pope" (1 vol.). The reports of these investigations are to be found in the "Annual Reports of the Deputy Keeper of the Public Records", the first one, covering 1877, 1878, and 1879, is found under the year 1880.</ul>

<p>In addition to the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> material, numerous extracts and transcripts of a political nature were made from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century documents, transmitted to the Record Office and partly used in the "Calendars of State Papers".
<h3>France</h3>

<p>The Ecole Fran&ccedil;aise de <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, originally one with that of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, employs almost constantly historical investigators at the Grande Archivio of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>; they devote themselves to the documents of the Angevin dynasty. This institute has an organ of its own, the "M&eacute;langes d'arch&eacute;ologie et d'histoire", in whose pages are found not only historical studies properly so called, but also papers on the history of arch&aelig;ology and of art. The institute has its home in the Palazzo Farnese, where its director lives, and where a rich <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> is housed. It was founded in 1873, and during the reign of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, long before the opening of the secret archives, inaugurated its great achievement, the editing of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> "Regesta" of the thirteenth century, a gigantic and yet unfinished task. Scholars of international reputation have figured among its directors; its present head is Monsignor Louis Duchesne, whose monumental work, the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, and numerous other productions, place him in the forefront of Church historians. The "Biblioth&egrave;que des Ecoles Fran&ccedil;aises d'Ath&egrave;nes etde Rome", is made up of lengthy monographs by pupils of the Ecole, treating of divers subjects connected with their studies in the Vatican archives and <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> "Regesta" of the thirteenth century, the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, and the "Liber Censuum" (Fabre-Duchesne) form a second series of historical publications to the credit of the French <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. A third series is made up of documents selected from the fourteenth-century <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> "Regesta", and is entitled "Lettres des papes d'Avignon se rapportant &agrave; la France". The slow progress of so many learned enterprises is a matter of general regret, nor can one always approve the methods employed, though no one can deny the very great utility of these scholarly studies and researches for the history of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and its international relations. The <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> of the French National Institute of St-Louis des Fran&ccedil;ais have recently undertaken a work closely related to that of the Ecole Fran&ccedil;aise, the publication in concise regesta-like form of all letters of the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. Gratifying progress is being made with the "Regesta" of <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>. The review known as the "Annales de St-Louis des Fran&ccedil;ais", whose contributions to <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> were noteworthy, has been discontinued. Other works of a learned historical nature have been published by the <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> of this institute, the results of their diligent researches in the Vatican archives.
<h3>German Catholic institutes</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> of the German national institute of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> di Campo Santo Teutonico were among the first to profit by the opening of the secret archives for the conduct of scientific research in the field of German <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>. Monsignor de Waal, director of the institute, founded the "R&ouml;mische Quartalschrift f&uuml;r Arch&auml;ologie und Kirchengeschichte" as a centre for historical research more modest and limited in scope, and it fulfils this purpose in a creditable manner. To the students of history at the Campo Santo is owing the founding, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, of the G&ouml;rres Society Historical Institute. This institute, established after long hesitation, sufficiently explained by the slender resources of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, is now a credit to its founders (besides regular reports, begun in 1890, on the work of this institute, and filed in the records of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, see Cardauns, "Die G&ouml;rres Gesellschaft, 1876-1901", Cologne, 1901, pp. 65-73). In 1900 a new department was added and placed under the guidance of Monsignor Wilpert, for the study of <a href="../cathen/03705a.htm">Christian arch&aelig;ology</a> and the history of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a>. The Roman labours of the G&ouml;rres Society Institute deal chiefly with nunciature reports, the administration records of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> since 1300, and the Acts of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. Other publications, more or less broad in scope, are published regularly in the "Historisches Jahrbuch", among its "Quellen und Forschungen", or in other organs of the G&ouml;rres Society. The twelve stout volumes in which this institute proposes to edit exhaustively the Acts and records of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, represent one of the most difficult and important tasks which could be set before a body of workers in the Vatican archives. The aforesaid investigation of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> administration and financial records, which the institute investigates in cooperation with the Austrian Leo Society, open up a chief source of information for the history of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.

<p>The results accomplished by this purely private association surpass greatly those of many governmental institutes. The G&ouml;rres Society Institute maintains at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> no <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of its own, but aids efficiently in the growth of the fine <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> at the Campo Santo Teutonico, near the Vatican. The Leo Society supports at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a trained investigator, who devotes his time to publications from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> treasury (<em>Camera</em>), records of the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. The present director of the G&ouml;rres Society Institute is Dr. Stephan Ehses.
<h3>Austria</h3>

<p>The Austrian institute (Instituto Austriaco di studi storici), established by Theodor von Sickel, and now directed by Professor von Pastor, has existed since 1883. It affords young historical workers the means of familiarizing themselves during a brief sojourn at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the rich <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> materials accumulated there, and in this way enables them to produce monographs of value. It cooperates in the publication of the nunciature reports, and contemplates the publication of the correspondence of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> and the ambassadors at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. Among the publications of this institute are Sickel's study on the "Privilegium Ottonianum"; his edition of the <a href="../cathen/09215c.htm">"Liber Diurnus"</a>; and his noteworthy "R&ouml;mische Berichte" (Roman reports). Several valuable studies by this institute have appeared in the "Mittheilungen des &ouml;sterreichischen Institutes f&uuml;r Geschichtsforschung," dealing with the work of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chancery, while Ottenthal's "Chancery Rules" and Tangl's "Chancery Regulations" are constantly referred to in every recent work on the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. The numerous historical commissions which were sent from <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (concerning which, see below) may be considered as auxiliaries of the Austrian Institute.
<h3>Prussia</h3>

<p>A short history of the founding of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> historical institute was published by Friedensburg (Berlin, Academy of Sciences). The project dates back to 1883, but it was not until May of 1888 that Konrad Schottm&uuml;ller succeeded in opening a <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Historical Bureau that began modestly enough, but soon developed into the actual <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Institute, reorganized (12 November, 1902) on a materially enlarged scale, and now the most important of all historical institutes at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, owing largely to the efforts of its present director, Professor Kehr. In addition to the general work of historical investigations, special departments are conducted for the history of art and for patristic and Biblical research. Besides its own publication," Quellen und Forschungen aus italienischen Archiven" the institute issues a series of German nunciature reports (eleven volumes since 1897). The Library of the Institute, besides extensive monographs on various subjects, has published the useful "Repertorium Germanicum", and, in co-operation with the Instituto Storico Italiano, the "Registrum chartarum Itali&aelig;", a series of independent volumes. These researches take in Italian, German, French, English, and Spanish archives; <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> are likewise visited occasionally. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the institute ranks, with that of the Palazzo Farnese, among the best historical <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.
<h3>Hungary</h3>

<p>The "Hungaricorum Historicorum Collegium Romanum", though no longer in existence, owed its inception in 1892 to the efforts of Monsignor Frakn&oacute;i, and published under his direction (since 1897) the "Monumenta Vaticana historiam regni Hungari&aelig; illustrantia", whose two series in ten folio volumes are a lasting tribute to the munificence of Frakn&oacute;i. Other noteworthy monographs based on Roman documents and illustrating the history of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> must be credited to this institute.
<h3>Belgium</h3>

<p>The "Institut historique Belge &agrave; <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>" was founded in December, 1904. The minister of state defined its purpose to be the searching of Italian archives, and especially those of the Vatican, for historical material bearing on <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and the publication of the results obtained. The project included a centre for individual <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> investigators as well as for students assisted by the State, where all might find an adequate <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> and facilities for securing historical data of every kind. The institute, it is hoped, will eventually become an "Ecole des hautes &eacute;tudes" for the study of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and profane history, classical philology, arch&aelig;ology, and the history of art. Its first director was Dom Ursmer Berli&egrave;re, of the Abbey of Maredsous (1904-1907); his successor is Dr. Gottfried Kurth, professor emeritus at the University of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>. The institute has published thus far two volumes of "Analecta Vaticano-Belgica": <ul><li>I, "Suppliques de Cl&eacute;ment VI" (1342-1352), by Berli&egrave;re; <li>II, "Lettres de Jean XXII" (1316-1334), vol. I (1316-1324), by Fayen.</ul>

<p>The following are in preparation: <ul><li>"Lettres de Jean XXII", vol. II, by Fayen; <li>"Suppliques d'Innocent VI" (1352-1362), by Berli&egrave;re; <li>"Lettres de Benoit XII" (1334-1342), by Fierens.</ul>

<p>Two other volumes are under way. By his pamphlet "De la cr&eacute;ation d'une &eacute;cole Belge &agrave; Rome" (Tournai, 1896), Professor Cauchie of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> contributed greatly to the founding of the institute.
<h3>Holland</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherland</a> institute grew out of various historical commissions, the last of which was established 20 May, 1904. Its two representatives, Dr. Brom and Dr. Orbaan, were appointed on 31 March, 1906, director and secretary respectively of the state institute founded on this <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, and of which they thus became the first members (Brom, "Nederlandsche gesehiedvorsching en Rome", 1903). This institute aims at a systematic investigation of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland's</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and political relations, and of her artistic, scientific, and <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> relations, with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> during the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries, a period of very great importance for <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. A yearly report of the institute and its <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> appears at <a href="../cathen/07108a.htm">The Hague</a> in "Verslagen omtrent's Rikjs onde archieven". Besides a number of essays and minor works, there appeared at <a href="../cathen/07108a.htm">The Hague</a>, during 1908, a work by Brom, "Archivalia in Italie"; part I, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, "Vaticaansch Archief". All historical material in Italian archives bearing on the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> will be concisely described in this series of volumes; the first part contains 2650 numbers, and is specially valuable because of the excellent conspectus it offers of the contents of the Vatican archives. A work by Orbaan, on <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> scholars and artists in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, is ready for the press (1910).
<h2 id="section6">Miscellaneous researches in the Vatican Archives</h2>

<p>The institutes above-mentioned offer a very incomplete <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the historical work done in the Vatican archives. Many <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, Austrians, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgians</a>, and others flock to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and spend much of their time in private investigations of their own. Most of these workers attach themselves to some institute and profit by its experience. Among Americans we may mention Professor Charles Homer Haskins, who familiarized himself with the treasures contained in the archives and <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, and made a report on the same for the "American Historical Review", reprinted in the "Catholic University Bulletin", Washington, 1897, pp. 177-196; Rev. P. de Roo, who laboured for several years on the "Regesta" of <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>; Heywood, who compiled the "Documenta selecta e tabulario Sanct&aelig; Sedis, insulas et terras anno 1492 repertas a Christophoro Columbo respicientia", which he published in phototype in 1892. Other American scholars have profited largely by the immemorial academic hospitality of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. Special mention should be made here of the studies of Luka Jelic and Conrad Eubel concerning early missionary enterprises, and of an essay by Shipley on "The Colonization of America" (Lucerne, 1899). For other valuable information see the tenth volume of the "Records of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia". The time would seem to be at hand for the foundation of an American <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> historical institute, which would take over the task of collecting and publishing in a systematic way the numerous important documents concerning the American Church preserved in many places at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, particularly in the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> archives. <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> has sent historical commissions to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> repeatedly, and for several years at a time. The names of Schmurlow, Br&uuml;ckner, Pierling, Forster, Wiersbowski, and others are sufficient reminders of the excellent work accomplished. From <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> came Dr. Murakami, to explore the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> and Vatican archives for a history of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missions to <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> (1549-1690). <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> is represented among the investigators by such names as Moltesen, Krarup, and Lindback; <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> by Storm, and Sweden by Tegn&eacute;r, Elof, Karlson, and others. Moritz Stern, Felix Vernet, and others obtained at the Vatican material for a history of the Hebrews. The Spanish Government was long officially represented by the famous Spanish historian, Ricardo de Hinojosa, while researches in Portuguese history are conducted by MacSwiney. <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> entered into this peaceful competition by the labours of Kirsch and Baumgarten in 1899, and since the close of the last century many <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> have visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for Vatican researches, both as <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> and on official missions. We need only mention the names of B&uuml;chi, Wirz, Bernoulli, Steffens, Reinhard, and St&uuml;ckelberg.

<p>In addition to these and many more names, we must mention the numerous religious who seek in the archives fresh material for general <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>, or the history of their order, e.g. the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>. The writer has observed at work in the archives during the last twenty-one years <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, Minor <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, Trinitarians, <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilians</a>, <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>, Lateran <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a>, <a href="../cathen/15262a.htm">Vallombrosans</a>, <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a>, <a href="../cathen/11244c.htm">Olivetans</a>, <a href="../cathen/14372c.htm">Silvestrines</a>, <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>, Augustinians, <a href="../cathen/10197b.htm">Mercedarians</a>, <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a>, and others. <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Women</a> have at times secured temporary admittance, though for intelligible reasons this privilege is now restricted. Since 1879 the archives have welcomed <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, Hebrews, believers and infidels, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, rich and poor, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of high social standing and plain citizens, of every nation and language. The writer is acquainted with nearly all the great archives of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and knows that none of them afford similar facilities to the historical student or extend him more courtesy. The number of visitors is at all times higher than to other archives, while the freedom allowed in the use of the material is the most far-reaching known; practically nothing is kept hidden.
<h2 id="section7">Results of Vatican research</h2>

<p>It is not easy to determine which branch of historical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> derives most benefit from Vatican research, nor is the question a simple one. Chronologically, there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that so far the most favoured period is that of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The sixteenth century comes next, much light being shed on it by the nunciature reports and the Acts of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. The seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries have hitherto been represented by few works, and these not very comprehensive. From the standpoint of subjects treated, Vatican research falls into three parts: <ul><li>(1) The study of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> relations of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with individual nations or peoples; <li>(2) Roman <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration in all its details; <li>(3) the influence exerted by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> on the civilized world, whether purely political or of a mixed political and religious nature. </ul>

<p>If we consider the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> period under the first of these subdivisions the results obtained are substantially as follows: <ul><li>(a) compilation of correct lists of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; <li>(b) investigation of the so-called <em>Servitia</em> (<em>communia et secreta</em>), i.e. of certain dues paid at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, among them <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> dues; <li>(c) completer lists of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, prelateships and churches directly subject to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; <li>(d) lists, as complete as possible, of all kinds of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> ordinances, processes decisions, constitutions, and decrees; <li>(e) study of the entire system of minor <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> in so far as affected by curial reservations; <li>(f) selection from the petition files of all requests growing out of the said system; <li>(g) reports of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> on the state of their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and consistorial processes; <li>(h) investigation into the influence of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, to determine how far the respective local authorities were influenced by the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>; <li>(i) inquiry into the taxes imposed on <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and Churches for purely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> purposes, and into the ways and means of collecting these taxes.</ul>

<p>For certain <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, ecclesiastical provinces, regions, or entire countries, all these data, together with other items of information, have in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> been gathered, and published, by <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> and by associations. They have also, in a general way, been made generally accessible by the publication, as a whole, of the respective <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> registers (see PAPAL REGISTERS), e.g. the "Regesta" publications of the French institute, and the cameral (papal fiscal) reports of the G&ouml;rres and Leo <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. <a href="../cathen/03637a.htm">"Chartularia"</a>, or collections of <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bulls</a> have been published not only for <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, Eastern and Western <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, but also for <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">Great Britain</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (<em>Repertorium Germanicum</em>), not to speak of other countries. Many a student of the Vatican archives has devoted all his time to a single subject, e.g. Armellini, "Le Chiese di Roma"; Storm, "Die Obligationen der norwegischen Pr&auml;laten von 1311-1523"; Samaran-Mollat, "La fiscalit&eacute; pontificale en France au 14<sup>me</sup> si&egrave;cle"; Berli&egrave;re, "Les 'Libri Obligationum et Solutionum' des archives vaticanes", for the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, Th&eacute;rouanne, and Tournai; Rieder, "R&ouml;mische Quellen zur Konstanzer Bisthumsgeschichte (1305-1378)".

<p>The work done in the second subdivision is of the greatest importance for questions of history, canon law, and general and <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> culture. The all-pervading activity of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> has been richly illustrated by various investigators, e.g. G&ouml;ller on the records of the "P&oelig;nitentiaria"; Kirsch and Baumgarten on the finances (officials, administration) of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a>; Baumgarten on the respective offices of the vice-chancellor and the "Bullatores", the residence-quarters of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>, its Cursores or messengers; Watzl, G&ouml;ller, and Sch&auml;fer on the finance bureau of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>; von Ottenthal on the secretaries and the "Chancery rules"; Tangl and Erler respectively on the "Chancery regulations" and the "Liber Cancellari&aelig;"; Kehr, Berli&egrave;re, and Rieder on the petition files (<em>libelli supplices</em>), etc. The student will find quite helpful illustration of these delicate labours in the remarkable editions of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> by Duchesne; the "Liber Censuum" by Duchesne-Fabre; the "Italia Pontificia" by Kehr; the "Hierarchia Catholica Medii &AElig;vi" by Eubel; the "Catalogue of Cardinals" by Cristofori; the "Acts of the Council of Trent", by Ehses, Merkle, and Buschbell, not to speak of numerous other valuable works. As to the third subdivision, i.e. the purely political, or politico-ecclesiastical activities of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, no clearly defined distinction can be made, either in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> or in more modern times, between these activities and the exercise of purely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority; their numerous manifestations may be studied in the publications briefly described above. Abundant information is to be found in the publications of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> "Regesta" and the "Camera" or treasury, records. We learn from them many curious items of profane history, e.g. the population of various kingdoms, grants of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to kings and rulers for political purposes, etc. The nunciature reports are rich in this information.

<p>In a general way the Vatican archives and these new historical Roman institutes have been particularly helpful towards a better <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the ecclesiastico-religious relations of individual <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, countries, and peoples with the head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and its central administration. So numerous have been the results of investigation published along these lines, that it has hitherto been impracticable to prepare an exhaustive bibliography of the works based on studies in the Vatican archives. Melampo and Ranuzzi, following in the footsteps of Meister, have recently published a very useful, but not at all exhaustive, list of all the books and essays of this kind which had appeared up to 1900: "Saggio bibliografico dei lavori eseguiti nell' Archivio Vaticano" (Rome, 1909). (See <a href="../cathen/15276b.htm">VATICAN</a>, sub-title <em>Archives</em>, <em>Library;</em> and <a href="../cathen/03048c.htm">BULLARIUM</a>.)
