<h1>Rome</h1>  

<p>The significance of Rome lies primarily in the fact that it is the city of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>, as the successor of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a>, is the <a href="../cathen/15403b.htm">Vicar of Christ</a> on earth and the visible head of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Rome is consequently the centre of unity in <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, the source of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> and the seat of the supreme authority which can bind by its enactments the faithful throughout the world. The Diocese of Rome is known as the "See of Peter", the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">"Apostolic See"</a>, the "Holy <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>" the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">"Holy See"</a> &#151; titles which indicate its unique position in <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> and suggest the origin of its preeminence. Rome, more than any other city, bears witness both to the past splendour of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> world and to the triumph of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. It is here that the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> can be traced from the earliest days, from the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> beginnings in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacombs</a> to the majestic ritual of <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. At every turn one comes upon places hallowed by the deaths of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, the lives of innumerable <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, the memories of wise and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pontiffs</a>. From Rome the bearers of the Gospel message went out to the peoples of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and eventually to the uttermost ends of the earth. To Rome, again, in every age countless <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> have thronged from all the nations, and especially from English-speaking countries. With religion the missionaries carried the best elements of ancient culture and civilization which Rome had preserved amid all the vicissitudes of barbaric invasion. To these treasures of antiquity have been added the productions of a nobler art inspired by higher ideals, that have filled Rome with masterpieces in <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architecture</a>, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>. These appeal indeed to every mind endowed with artistic perception; but their full meaning only the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> believer can appreciate, because he alone, in his deepest thought and feeling, is at one with the spirit that pulsates here in the heart of the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a>.

<p>Many details concerning Rome have been set forth in other articles of THE CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA.

<p>The present article will be divided: <ul> <li>Topography and Existing Conditions; <li>General History of the City; <li>Churches and other Monuments.</ul>
<h2 id="section1">Topography and existing conditions</h2>

<p>The City of Rome rises on the banks of the Tiber at a distance of from 16 to 19 miles from the mouth of that river, which makes a deep furrow in the plain which extends between the Alban hills, to the south; the hills of <a href="../cathen/11421a.htm">Palestrina</a> and <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tivoli</a>, and the Sabine hills, to the east: and the Umbrian hills and Monte Tolfa, to the north. The city stands in latitude 41&#176;54' N. and longitude 12&#176;30' E. of Greenwich. It occupies, on the left bank, not only the plain, but also the adjacent heights, namely, portions of the Parioli hills, of the Pincian, the Quirinal, the Viminal, the Esquiline (which are only the extremities of a mountain-mass of tufa extending to the Alban hills), the Capitoline, the C&aelig;lian, the Palatine, and the Aventine &#151; hills which are now isolated. On the right bank is the valley lying beneath Monte Mario the Vatican, and the Janiculan, the last-named of which has now become covered with houses and gardens. The Tiber, traversing the city, forms two sharp bends and an island (S. Bartolomeo), and within the city its banks are protected by the strong and lofty walls which were begun in 1875. The river is crossed by fourteen bridges, one of them being only provisional, while ten have been built since 1870. There is also a railroad drawbridge near St. Paul's. Navigation on the river is practicable only for vessels of light draught, which anchor at Ripa Grande, taking cargoes of oil and other commodities.

<p>For the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a>, the city is divided into 54 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (including 7 in the suburbs), administered partly by <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, partly by regular. The boundaries of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> have been radically changed by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, to meet new needs arising out of topographical changes. Each <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> has, besides its <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, one or two <a href="../cathen/12407a.htm">assistant priests</a>, a chief <a href="../cathen/13322a.htm">sacristan</a>, and an indeterminate number of <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> every year elect a chamberlain of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, whose position is purely honorary; every month they assemble for a conference to discuss cases in <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> and also the practical exigencies of the ministry. In each <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> there is a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> committee for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> works; each has its various confraternities, many of which have their own church and oratory. In the vast extent of country outside of Rome, along the main highways, there are <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> for the accommodation of the few settled inhabitants, and the labourers and shepherds who from October to July are engaged in the work of the open country. In former times most of these <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> had <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of their own, who also kept <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; nowadays, through the exertions of the Society for the Religious Aid of the Agro Romano (i.e. the country districts around Rome), <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are taken thither from Rome every <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> to say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>, catechize, and preach on the Gospel. The houses of male religious number about 160; of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> religious, 205, for the most part devoted to teaching, ministering to the sick in public and private <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, managing various houses of retreat etc. Besides the three patriarchal chapters (<em>see below, under</em> "Churches"), there are at Rome eleven collegiate chapters.



<p>In the patriarchal <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> there are confessors for all the principal languages. Some nations have their national churches (Germans, Anima and Campo Santo; French, S. Luigi and S. Claudio; Croats, S. Girolamo dei Schiavoni; <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgians</a>, S. Giuliano; Portuguese, S. Antonio; <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, S. Maria in Monserrato; to all which may be added the churches of the Oriental rites). Moreover, in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>, particularly the generalates, as well as in the various national colleges, it is possible for foreigners to fulfil their religious <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>. For English-speaking <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> (S. Clemente) and of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> (S. Isidoro), the English, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, and American Colleges, the new Church of S. Patrizio in the Via Ludovisi, that of S. Giorgio of the English Sisters in the Via S. Sebastianello, and particularly S. Silvestro in Capite (Pallottini) should be mentioned. In these churches, too, there are, regularly, sermons in English on <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast-day</a> afternoons, during <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> and <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a>, and on other occasions. Sometimes there are sermons in English in other churches also, notice being given beforehand by bills posted outside the churches and by advertisements in the papers. First Communions are mostly made in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches; many <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> place their daughters in seclusion during the period of immediate preparation, in some <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institution</a>. There are also two institutions for the preparation of boys for their First Communion, one of them without charge (Ponte Rotto). <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> is taught both in the day and night <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> which are dependent either on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, or on religious congregations or <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> associations. For those who attend the public elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> is provided on Sunday and <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast-day</a> afternoons. For intermediate and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> students suitable <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of religious instruction have been formed, connected with the language <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and the scholastic <em>ripetizioni</em>, so as to attract the young men. The confraternities, altogether 92 in number, are either professional (for members of certain professions or trades), or national, or for some charitable object (e.g., for charity to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>; S. Lucia del Gonfalone and others like it, for giving dowries to poor young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of good character; the Confraternit&agrave; della Morte, for burying those who die in the country districts, and various confraternities for escorting funerals, of which the principal one is that of the Sacconi; that of S. Giovanni Decollato, to assist <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>), or again they have some purely devotional aim, like the Confraternities of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/03711b.htm">Christian Doctrine</a>, of the various mysteries of religion, and of certain <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.

<p>For <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> instruction there are in the city, besides the various Italian and foreign colleges, three great <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>: the Gregorian, under the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; the Schools of the Roman Seminary, at S. Apollinare; the Collegio Angelico of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, formerly known as the Minerva. Several <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders also have <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of their own &#151; the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> at S. Anselmo, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> at S. Antonio, the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> at S. Alfonso, the Calced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> at the College of S. Alberto, the. Capuchina the Minor <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a>, the Augustinians, and others. (<em>See</em> <a href="../cathen/13131a.htm">ROMAN COLLEGES</a>.) For classical studies there are, besides the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of S. Apollinare, the Collegio Massimo, under the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, comprising also elementary and technical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; the Collegio Nazareno (Piarists), the gymnasium and intermediate <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of which take rank with those of the Government; the Instituto Angelo Mai (Barnabite). The <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a> have a flourishing technical institute (de Merode) with a boarding-house (<em>convitto</em>). There are eight colleges for youths under the direction of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> or religious. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the Society for the Protection of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Interests also maintain forty-six elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for the people mostly under the care of religious congregations. For the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of girls there are twenty-six institutions directed by Sisters, some of which also receive day-pupils. The <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> are nine in number, and some of them are connected with technical and industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesians</a>, too, have a similar institution, and there are two agricultural institutions. Hospices are provided for converts from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> and for Hebrew <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a>. Thirty other houses of refuge, for infants, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, old people, etc., are directed by religious men or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.

<p>As the capital of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Rome is the residence of the reigning house, the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, the tribunals, and the other civil and military officials of both the national Government and the provincial. For public instruction there are the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, two technical institutes, a commercial high school, five gymnasium-lyceums, eight technical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> institute for the preparation of secondary teachers, a national boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and other lay institutions, besides a military college. There are also several private <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for languages etc. &#151; the Vaticana, the Nazionale (formed out of the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of the Roman College, of the Arac&oelig;li Convent and other monastic <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> partially ruined), the Corsiniana (now the School of the Accademia dei Lincei), the Casanatense, the Angelica (formerly belonging to the Augustinians), the Vallicellana (Oratorians, founded by Cardinal <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>), the Militare Centrale, the Chigiana, and others. (For the academies see <a href="../cathen/01083b.htm">ROMAN ACADEMIES</a>.) Foreign nations maintain institutions for artistic, historical, or arch&aelig;ological study (America, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">Great Britain</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>). There are three <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> and meteorological observatories: the Vatican, the Capitol (Campidoglio), and the Roman College (<a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>), the last-named, situated on the Janiculan, has been suppressed. The museums and galleries worthy of mention are the Vatican (see <a href="../cathen/15276b.htm">VATICAN</a>), those of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and of profane antiquities at the Lateran (famous for the "Dancing Satyr"; the "Sophocles", one of the finest of portrait <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> in existence found at <a href="../cathen/14518c.htm">Terracina</a>; the "Neptune", the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sarcophagi with decorations in relief, and the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>). In the gallery at the Lateran there are <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="../cathen/04509a.htm">Crivelli</a>, <a href="../cathen/06688b.htm">Gozzoli</a>, <a href="../cathen/09278a.htm">Lippi</a>, Spagna, Francia, Palmezzano, <a href="../cathen/13485b.htm">Sassoferrato</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13687d.htm">Seitz</a>. The Capitoline Museum contains Roman prehistoric <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> and household furniture, reliefs from the Arch of <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a>, a head of Amalasunta, a half-length figure of the <a href="../cathen/04166a.htm">Emperor Commodus</a>, the epitaph of the infant prodigy Quintus Sulpicius Maximus, the Esquiline and the Capitoline Venuses, "Diana of the Ephesians", the Capitoline Wolf (Etruscan work of the fifth century <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), Marforius, the Dying Gladiator, busts of the emperors and other famous men of antiquity, and <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian's</a> "Lex regia"; the Gallery contains works by Spagna, Tintoretto, <a href="../cathen/03374c.htm">Caracci</a>, <a href="../cathen/10569b.htm">Caravaggio</a>, Guercino (St. Petronilla, the original of the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> in St. Peter's), <a href="../cathen/12771a.htm">Guido Reni</a>, <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a>, Van Dyke, <a href="../cathen/05102b.htm">Domenichino</a>, <a href="../cathen/03169b.htm">Paolo Veronese</a>, and other masters.

The Villa Giulia has a collection of Etruscan terracotta; the Museo Romano, objects recently excavated; the Museo Kircheriano has been enlarged into an ethnographical museum. The Borghese Gallery is in the villa of the same name. The National Gallery, in the Exposition Building (<em>Palazzo dell' Esposizione</em>), is formed out of the Corsini, Sciarra, and Torlonia collections, together with modern acquisitions. There are also various private collections in different parts of the city.

<p>The institutions of public charity are all consolidated in the Congregazione di Carit&agrave;, under the Communal Administration. There are twenty-seven public <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, the most important of which are: the Polyclinic, which is destined to absorb all the others; S. Spirito, to which is annexed the <a href="../cathen/08038b.htm">lunatic asylum</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">foundling hospital</a>; S. Salvatore, a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, in the Lateran; S. Giacomo; S. Antonio; the Consolazione; two military <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. There are also an institute for the blind, two clinics for diseases of the eye, twenty-five asylums for abandoned children, three lying-in <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and numerous private clinics for paying patients. The great public promenades are the Pincian, adjoining the Villa Borghese and now known as the Umberto Primo, where a zoological garden has recently been installed, and the Janiculum. Several private parks or gardens, as the Villa Pamphili, are also accessible to the public every day.

<p>The population of Rome in 1901 was 462,783. Of these 5000 were <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, 7000 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, 8200 of other <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> and no religion. In the census now (1910) being made an increase of more than 100,000 is expected. Rome is now the most salubrious of all the large cities of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, its mortality for 1907 being 18.8 per thousand, against 19.9 at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and 19.6 at <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>. The Press is represented by five agencies: there are 17 daily papers, two of them <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ("Osservatore Romano" and "Corriere d'Italia"); 8 periodicals are issued once or oftener in the week (5 catholic, 4 in English &#151; "Rome", "Roman Herald", "Roman Messenger", "Roman World"); 88 are issued more than once a month (7 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>); there are 101 monthlies (19 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>); 55 periodicals appear less frequently than once a month.
<h2 id="section2">General history of the city</h2>

<p>Arms and implements of the Pal&aelig;olithic Age, found in the near vicinity of Rome, testify to the presence of man here in those remote times. The most recent excavations have established that as early as the eighth century <font size=-2>B.C.</font> or, according to some, several centuries earlier, there was a group of human habitations on the Palatine Hill, a tufaceous ledge rising in the midst of marshy ground near the Tiber. (That river, it may be observed here, was known to the primitive peoples by the name of <em>Rumo</em>, "the River".) Thus is the traditional account of the origin of Rome substantially verified. At the same time, or very little later, a colony of Sabines was formed on the Quirinal, and on the Esquiline an Etruscan colony. Between the Palatine and the Quirinal rose the Capitoline, once covered by two sacred groves, afterwards occupied by the temple of Jupiter and the Rock. Within a small space, therefore, were established the advance guards of three distinct peoples of different characters; the Latins, shepherds; the Sabines, tillers of the soil; the Etruscans, already far advanced in civilization, and therefore in commerce and the industries. How these three villages became a city, with, first, the Latin influence preponderating, then the Sabine, then the Etruscan (the two Tarquins), is all enveloped in the obscurity of the history of the seven kings (753-509 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>). The same uncertainty prevails as to the conquests made at the expense of the surrounding peoples. it is unquestionable that all those conquests had to be made afresh after the expulsion of the kings.

<p>But the social organization of the new city during this period stands out clearly: There were three original tribes: the Ramnians (Latins), the Titians (Sabines), and the Luceres (Etruscans). Each tribe was divided into ten <em>curi&oelig;</em>, each <em>curia</em> into ten <em>gentes</em>; each <em>gens</em> into ten (or thirty) <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. Those who belonged to these, the most ancient, tribes were Patricians, and the chiefs of the three hundred <em>gentes</em> formed the Senate. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with surrounding peoples, new inhabitants occupied the remaining hills; thus, under Tullus Hostilius, the C&aelig;lian was assigned to the population of the razed Alba Longa (Albano); the Sabines, conquered by Ancus Martius, had the Aventine. Later on, the Viminal was occupied. The new inhabitants formed the Plebeians (<em>Plebs</em>), and their civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> were less than those of the older citizens. The internal history of Rome down to the Imperial Period is nothing but a struggle of plebeians against patricians for the acquisition of greater civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, and these struggles resulted in the civil, political, and juridical organization of Rome. The king was high-priest, judge, leader in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and head of the Government; the Senate and the Comitia of the People were convoked by him at his pleasure, and debated the measures proposed by him. Moreover, the kingly dignity was hereditary. Among the important public works in this earliest period were the drains, or sewers (<em>cloac&oelig;</em>), for draining the marshes around the Palatine, the work of the Etruscan Tarquinius Priscus; the city wall was built by Servius Tullius, who also organized the Plebeians, dividing them into thirty tribes; the Sublician Bridge was constructed to unite the Rome of that time with the Janiculan.

<p>During the splendid reign of Tarquinius Superbus, Rome was the mistress of Latium as far as Circeii and Signia. But, returning victorious from Ardea, the king found the gates of the city closed against him. Rome took to itself a republican form of government, with two consuls, who held office for only one year; only in times of difficulty was a dictator elected, to wield unlimited power. In the expulsion of Tarquinius Superbus some historians have seen a revolt of the Latin element against Etruscan domination. Besides <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and treaties with the Latins and other peoples, the principal events, down to the burning of Rome by the Gauls, were the institution of the tribunes of the people (<em>tribuni plebis</em>), the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the Twelve Tables, and the destruction of Veii. In 390 the Romans were defeated by the Gauls near the River Allia; a few days later the city was taken and set on fire, and after the Gauls had departed it was rebuilt without plan or rule. Cumillus, the dictator, reorganized the army and, after long resistance to the change, at last consented that one of the consuls should be a plebeian. Southern Etruria became subject to Rome, with the capture of <a href="../cathen/10750a.htm">Nepi and Sutri</a> in 386. The Appian Way and Aqueduct were constructed at this period. Very soon it was possible to think of conquering the whole peninsula. The principal stages of this conquest are formed by the three <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against the Samnites (victory of Suesaula 343); the victory of Bovianum, 304; those over the Etruscans and Umbrians, in 310 and 308; lastly the victory of Sentinum, in 295, over the combined Samnites, Etruscans, and Gauls. The Tarentine (282-272) and the First and Second Punic Wars (264-201) determined the conquest of the rest of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, with the adjacent islands, as well as the first invasion of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>.

<p>Soon after this, the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a> (Cynoscephal&aelig;, 197; Pydna, 168) and Greece (capture of <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, 146) were subdued, while the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Antiochus of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> (192-89) and against the Galatians (189) brought Roman supremacy into <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, In 146 Carthage was destroyed, and Africa reduced to subjection; between 149 and 133 the conquest of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> was completed. Everywhere Roman colonies sprang up. With conquest, the luxurious vices of the conquered peoples also came to Rome, and thus the contrast between patricians and plebeians was accentuated. To champion the cause of the plebeians there arose the brothers Tiberius and Calus Gracchus. The Servile Wars (132-171) and the Jugurthine War (111-105) revealed the utter corruption of Roman <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Marius and Sulla, both of whom had won glory in foreign <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, rallied to them the two opposing parties, Democratic and Aristocratic, respectively. Sulla firmly established his dictatorship with the victory of the Colline Gate (83), reorganized the administration, and enacted some good <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> to arrest the moral decay of the city. But the times were ripe for the oligarchy, which was to lead in the natural course of events to the monarchy. In the year 60, C&aelig;sar, Pompey, and Crassus formed the first Triumvirate. While C&aelig;sar conquered Gaul (58-50), and Crassus waged an unsuccessful <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the Parthians (54-53), Pompey succeeded in gaining supreme control of the capital. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between Pompey to whom the nobles adhered, and C&aelig;sar, who had the democracy with him, was inevitable. The battle of Pharsalia (48) decided the issue; in 45 C&aelig;sar was already thinking of establishing monarchical government; his assassination (44) could do no more than delay the movement towards monarchy. Another triumvirate was soon formed by Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian; Antony and Octavian disagreed, and at Actium (32) the issue was decided in <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Octavian's</a> favour. Roman power had meanwhile been consolidated and extended in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, and even as far as Pannonia, in <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, in Palestine, and in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Henceforward Roman history is no longer the history of the City of Rome, although it was only under <a href="../cathen/03328c.htm">Caracalla</a> (<font size=-2>A.D.</font> 211) that Roman citizenship was accorded to all free subjects of the empire.

<p>In the midst of these political vicissitudes the city was growing and being beautified with <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> and other buildings, public and private. On the Campus Martius and beyond the Tiber, at the foot of the Janiculan, new and populous quarters sprang up with theatres (those of Pompey and of Marcellus) and circuses (the Maximus and the Flaminius, 221 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>). The centre of political life was the Forum, which had been the market before the centre of buying and selling was transferred, in 388, to the Campus Martius (<em>Forum Holitorium</em>), leaving the old <em>Forum Romanum</em> to the business of the State. Here were the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> of Concord (366), Saturn (497), the D&icirc; Consentes, Castor and Pollux (484), the Basilica &AElig;milia (179), the Basilica Julia (45), the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> Hostilia (S. Adriano), the Rostra, etc. Scarcely had the empire been consolidated when <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> turned his attention to the embellishment of Rome, and succeeding emperors followed his example: brick-built Rome became marble Rome. After the sixth decade <font size=-2>B.C.</font> many Hebrews had settled at Rome, in the Trastevere quarter and that of the Porta Capena, and soon they became a financial power. They were incessantly making <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselytes</a>, especially among the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of the upper classes. The names of thirteen <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> are known as existing (though not all at the same time) at Rome during the Imperial Period. Thus was the way prepared for the Gospel, whereby Rome, already mistress of the world, was to be given a new sublimer and more lasting, title to that dominion &#151; the dominion over the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>.

<p>Even on the <a href="../cathen/15614b.htm">Day of Pentecost</a>, "Roman strangers" (<em>adven&oelig; Romani</em>, <a href="../bible/act002.htm#vrs10">Acts 2:10</a>) were present at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and they surely must have carried the good news to their fellow-citizens at Rome. Ancient tradition assigns to the year 42 the first coming of St. Peter to Rome, though, according to the pseudo-Clementine Epistles, St. Barnabas was the first to preach the Gospel in the Eternal City. Under Claudius (c. <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 50), the name of Christ had become such an occasion of discord among the Hebrews of Rome that the emperor drove them all out of the city, though they were not long in returning. About ten years later Paul also arrived, a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, and exercised a vigorous apostolate during his sojourn. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were numerous at that time, even at the imperial Court. The burning of the city &#151; by order of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, who wished to effect a thorough renovation &#151; was the pretext for the first official <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name. Moreover, it was very natural that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, which had been occasional, should in course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> have become general and systematic; hence it is unnecessary to transfer the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the Apostles' <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> from the year 67, assigned by tradition, to the year 64 (see <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">SAINT PETER</a>; <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">SAINT PAUL</a>). <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian's</a> reign took its victims both from among the opponents of absolutism and from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; among them some who were of very exalted rank &#151; Titus Flavius Clemens, Acilius Glabrio (Cemetery of Priscilla), and <a href="../cathen/06098b.htm">Flavia Domitilla</a>, a relative of the emperor. It must have been then, too, that St. John, according to a very ancient legend (<a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>), was brought to Rome.

<p>The reign of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> and <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Adrian</a> was the culminating point of the arts at Rome. The Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> attributed to this period are, with the exception of St. Ignatius's, somewhat <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. At the same time the heads of various <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> settled at Rome, notably Valentinus, Cerdon, and <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>; but it does not appear that they had any great following. Under <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus</a>, <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04166a.htm">Commodus</a>, several Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> are known &#151; <a href="../cathen/14477b.htm">Pope St. Telesphorus</a>, Sts. Lucius, Ptolem&aelig;us, <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> and companions, and the Senator Apollonius. Under <a href="../cathen/04166a.htm">Commodus</a>, thanks to Martia, his morganatic wife, the condition of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> improved. At the same time the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Rhodon, <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a>, and others flourished. But three new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> from the East brought serious trouble to the internal peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: that of Theodotus, the shoemaker of Byzantium; that of Noetus brought in by one Epigonus; and <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanism</a>. In the struggle against these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, particularly the last-named, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>, a disciple of St. Iren&aelig;us, bore a distinguished part but he, in his turn, incurred the censures of Popes <a href="../cathen/15756c.htm">Zephyrinus</a> and Callistus and became the leader of a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> party. But the controversies between <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> and Callistus were not confined to <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> questions, but also bore upon discipline, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> thinking proper to introduce certain restrictions. Another <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> transplanted to Rome at this period was that of the <a href="../cathen/05372a.htm">Elcesaites</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/13721a.htm">Septimius Severus</a> does not appear to have been very acute at Rome, where, before this time, many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of rank &#151; even of the imperial household &#151; had been <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. The long period of tranquillity, hardly interrupted by Maximinus (235-38), fostered the growth of Roman church organization; so much so that, under <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a>, after the first fury of the <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, the city numbered about 50,000 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. The last-named <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> produced many Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> &#151; Pope St. Fabian among the first &#151; and many <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a>, and the problem of reconciling the latter resulted in the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/15256b.htm">Valerian</a>, too, fell first upon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Rome. Under <a href="../cathen/02108b.htm">Aurelian</a> (271-76), the menace of an invasion of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> who had already advanced as far as <a href="../cathen/11738b.htm">Pesaro</a> compelled the emperor to restore and extend the walls of Rome. The <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> also had its victims in the city, although there are no trustworthy records of them; it did not last long, however, in the West. <a href="../cathen/10073b.htm">Maxentius</a> went so far as to restore to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> their cemeteries and other landed <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and, if we are to believe <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, ended by showing them favour, as a means of winning popularity. At this period several pretentious buildings were erected &#151; baths, a circus, a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a>, etc. In the fourth and fifth centuries the city began to be embellished with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> buildings, and the moribund art of antiquity thus received a new accession of vitality.

<p>Of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of this period, <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> alone disturbed the religious peace for a brief space; even <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianiam</a> failed to take root. The conflict between triumphant <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and dying <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Paganism</a> was more bitter. Symmachus, Pr&aelig;textatus, and Nicomachus were the most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and most powerful defenders of the ancient religion. At <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> kept watch. By the end of the fourth century the deserted <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> were becoming filled with cobwebs; pontiffs and vestals were demanding <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of the gods served as public ornaments; precious objects were seldom plundered, and until the year 526 not one temple was converted to the uses of <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">Christian worship</a>. In, 402 the necessity once more arose of fortifying Rome. The capital of the world, which had never beheld a hostile army since the days of Hannibal, in 408 withstood the double siege of Alaric. But the Senate, mainly at the instigation of a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> minority, treated with Alaric, deposed Honorius, and <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> a new emperor Attalus. Two years later, Alaric returned, succeeded in taking the city, and sacked it. It is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, however, that the destruction of Rome began then. Under Alaric, as in the Gothic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the sixth century, only so much was destroyed as military exigencies rendered inevitable. The intervention of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo the Great</a> saved the Eternal City from the fury of <a href="../cathen/02061b.htm">Attila</a>, but could not prevent the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a>, in 456, from sacking it without mercy for fifteen days: <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, gold, silver, bronze, brass &#151; whether the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the State, or of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or of private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> &#151; were taken and shipped to Carthage.

<p>Rome still called itself the capital of the empire, but since the second century it had seen the emperors only at rare and fleeting moments; even the kings of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> preferred <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> as a residence. <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>, nevertheless, made provision for the outward magnificence of the city, preserving its monuments so far as was possible. Pope St. Agapetus and the learned <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> entertained the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of creating at Rome a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of advanced Scripture studies, on the model of that which flourished at <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, but the Gothic invasion made shipwreck of this design. In that titanic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> Rome stood five sieges. In 536 Belisarius took it without striking a blow. Next year Vitiges besieged it, cutting the aqueducts, plundering the outlying villas, and even penetrating into the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>; the city would have been taken had not the garrison of Hadrian's <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> defended themselves with fragments of the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of heroes and gods which they found in that monument. Soon after the departure of <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Pope Vigilius</a> from Rome (November, 545), King Totila invested it and captured a fleet bearing supplies sent by Vigilius, who by that time had passed over to <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. In December, 546, the city was captured, through the treachery of the Isaurian soldiery, and once more sacked. Totila, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to set out for the south, forced the whole population of Rome to leave the city, so that it was left uninhabited; but they returned with Belisarius in 547. Two years later, another Isaurian treachery made Totila once more master of the city, which then for the last time saw the games of the circus. After the battle of Tagin&aelig; (552), Rome opened its gates to Narces and became Byzantine. The ancient Senate and the Roman nobility were extinct. There was a breathing-space of sixteen years, and then the Lombards drew near to Rome, pillaging and destroying the neighbouring regions. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> has described the lamentable condition of the city; the same saint did his best to remedy matters. The seventh century was disastrously marked by a violent assault on the Lateran made by Mauricius, the <em><a href="../cathen/03637a.htm">chartularius</a></em> of the Exarch of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> (640), by the exile of Pope St. Martin (653), and by the visit of the Emperor Constans I (663). The <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of St. Sergius, which had been ordered by Justinian II, was prevented by the native troops of the Exarchate.

<p>In the eighth century the Lombards, with Liutprand, were seized with the old <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of occupying all <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and Rome in particular. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, from <a href="../cathen/06787a.htm">Gregory II</a> on, saved the city and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> from Lombard domination by the power of their threats, until they were finally rescued by the aid of Pepin, when Rome and the peninsula came under <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> domination. Provision was made for the material well-being of the city by repairs on the walls and the aqueducts, and by the establishment of agricultural colonies (<em>domus cult&oelig;</em>) for the cultivation of the wide domains surrounding the city. But in Rome itself there were various factions &#151; favouring either the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> or the Lombards, or, later on, <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> or Nationalist &#151; and these factions often caused tumults, as, in particular, on the death of <a href="../cathen/11577a.htm">Paul I</a> (767) and at the beginning of <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Leo III's</a> pontificate (795). With the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>  (799) Rome became finally detached from the Empire of the East. Though the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was master of Rome, the power of the Sword was wielded by the imperial <em>missi</em>, and this arrangement came to be more clearly defined by the Constitution of Lothair (824). Thus the government was divided. In the ninth century the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had to defend Rome and Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. Gregoriopolis, the Leonine City, placed outside the walls for the defence of the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Basilica of St. Peter</a>, and sacked in 846, and Joannipolis, for the defence of <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">St. Paul's</a> were built by <a href="../cathen/06789b.htm">Gregory IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Leo IV</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a>. The latter two and <a href="../cathen/08425b.htm">John X</a> also gained splendid victories over these barbarians.

<p>The decline of the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> dynasty was not without its effect upon the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and upon Rome, which became a mere lordship of the great <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, especially those of Theodora and Marozia. When Hugh of Provence wished to marry Marozia, so as to become master of Rome, his son Alberic rebelled against him and was elected their chief by the Romans, with the title of Patrician (<em>Patricius</em>) and Consul. The temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> might then have come to an end, had not John, Alberic's son, reunited the two powers. But John's life and his conduct of the government necessitated the intervention of the <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Emperor Otto I</a> (963), who instituted the office of <em>pr&oelig;fectus urbis</em>, to represent the imperial authority. (This office became hereditary in the Vico <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>.) Order did not reign for long: Crescentius, leader of the anti-papal party, deposed and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. It was only for a few brief intervals that <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a> (980) and <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> (996-998-1002) were able to re-establish the imperial and pontifical authority. At the beginning of the eleventh century three <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the counts of Tusculum immediately succeeded each other, and the last of the three, <a href="../cathen/02429a.htm">Benedict IX</a>, led a life so <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> as made it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Henry III to intervene (1046). The <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Honorius II and the struggle between <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> and Henry IV exasperated party passions at Rome, and conspicuous in the struggle was another Crescentius, a member of the Imperialist Party. <a href="../cathen/07072b.htm">Robert Guiscard</a>, called to the rescue by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, sacked the city and burned a great part of it, with immense destruction of monuments and documents. The struggle was revived under Henry V, and Rome was repeatedly besieged by the imperial troops.

<p>Then followed the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of <a href="../cathen/01447a.htm">Pier Leone (Anacletus II)</a>, which had hardly been ended, in 1143, when Girolamo di Pierleone, counselled by <a href="../cathen/01747b.htm">Arnold of Brescia</a>, made Rome into a republic, modelled after the Lombard communes, under the rule of fifty-six senators. In vain did Lucius II attack the Capitol, attempting to drive out the usurpers. The commune was in opposition no less to the imperial than to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority. At first the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> thought to lean on the emperors, and thus <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a> induced <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a> to burn Arnold alive (1155). Still, just as in the preceding century, every <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of an emperor was accompanied by quarrels and fights between the Romans and the imperial soldiery. In 1188 a <em>modus vivendi</em> was established between the commune and <a href="../cathen/04018a.htm">Clement III</a>, the people recognizing the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> sovereignty and conceding to him the right of <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a>, the senators and military captains being <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to swear fealty to him. But the friction did not cease. <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> (1203) was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee from Rome, but, on the other hand, the friendly disposition of the mercantile middle class facilitated his return and secured to him some influence in the affairs of the communes, in which he obtained the appointment of a chief of the Senate, known as "the senator" (1207). The Senate, therefore, was reduced to the status of the Communal Council of Rome; the senator was the syndic, or mayor, and remained so until 1870. In the conflicts between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, on the one hand, and, on the other <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> and his heirs, the Senate was mostly Imperialist, cherishing some sort of desire for the ancient independence; at times, however, it was divided against itself (as in 1262, for Richard, brother of the King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, against Manfred, King of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>).

<p>In 1263 Charles of Anjou, returning from the conquest of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, caused himself to be elected senator for life;. but <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> him to be content with a term of ten years. <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a> forbade that any foreign prince should be elected senator, and in 1278 he himself held the office. The election was always to be subject to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> approval. However, these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> soon fell into desuetude. The absence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> from Rome had the most disastrous results for the city: <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a> prevailed; the powerful <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of <a href="../cathen/04125c.htm">Colonna</a>, Savelli, Orsini, Anguillara, and others lorded it with no one to gainsay them; the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> vicars were either stupid or weak; the monuments crumbled of themselves or were destroyed; sheep and cows were penned in the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran Basilica</a>; no new buildings arose, except the innumerable towers, or keeps, of which Brancaleone degli Andal&ograve;, the senator (1252-56) caused more than a hundred to be pulled down; the revival of art, so promising in the thirteenth century was abruptly cut off. The mad enterprise of Cola di Rieuzo only added to the general confusion. The population was reduced to about 17,000. The Schism of the West, with the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of King Ladislaus (1408 and 1460, siege and sack of Rome), kept the city from benefiting by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes'</a> return as quickly as it should. Noteworthy, however, is the understanding between <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a> and the Senate as to their respective <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> (1393). This <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/08019a.htm">Innocent VII</a> also made provision for the restoration of the city.

<p>With <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> the renascence of Rome began. <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> again was driven out by the Romans, and <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> had to punish the conspiracy of Stefano Porcari; but the patronage of letters by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and the new spirit of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanism</a> obliterated the memory of these longings for independence. Rome became the city of the arts and of letters, of luxury and of dissoluteness. The population, too, changed in character and dialect, which had before more nearly approached the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a>, but now showed the influence of immigration from <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, Umbria, and the Marches. The sack of 1527 was a judgment, and a salutary warning to begin that reformation of manners to which the Brothers of the Oratory of Divine Love (the nucleus of the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatine Order</a>) and, later, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a> devoted themselves. In the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> and Philip II (1556), the <a href="../cathen/04125c.htm">Colonna</a> for the last time displayed their insubordination to the Pontifical Government. Until 1799 Rome was at peace under the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, who vied with the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> in embellishing the city with churches, fountains, obelisks, palaces, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>. Unfortunately, this work of restoration was accompanied by the destruction of ancient and, still more, <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> monuments. An attempt was also made to improve the ground plan of Rome by straightening and widening the streets (Sixths IV, <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> &#151; the Corso, the Ripetta, the Babuino, Giulia, Paola, Sistina, and other streets). The artists who have successively left their imprint on the City are <a href="../cathen/02736a.htm">Bramante</a>, <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>, <a href="../cathen/15428a.htm">Vignola</a>, <a href="../cathen/12283b.htm">Giacomo della Porta</a>, Fontana, <a href="../cathen/09512b.htm">Maderna</a>, <a href="../cathen/02510b.htm">Bernini</a>, <a href="../cathen/02688d.htm">Borromini</a>, and, in the eighteenth century, Fuga. The most important popular risings of this period were those against <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, on account of the mischief done by the Barberini and against Cardinal Cascia, after the death of <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a>.

<p>The pontificate of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, illustrious for its works of public utility, ended with the proclamation of the Republic of Rome (10 February, 1798) and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> exile. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> was able to return, but after 1806 there was a French Government at Rome side by side with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a>, and in 1809 the city was incorporated in the empire. General Miollis, indeed, deserved well of Rome for the public works he caused to be executed (the Pincian), and the arch&aelig;ological excavations, which were vigorously and systematically continued in the succeeding pontificates, especially that of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>. Of the works of art carried away to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> only a part were restored after the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>.

<p>But the Revolutionary germ still remained planted at Rome, even though it gave no signs of activity either in 1820 or in 1830 and 1831. A few political <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murders</a> were the only indication of the fire that smouldered beneath the ashes. The election of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, hailed as the Liberal pontiff, electrified all Rome. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> saw his power slipping away; the assassination of <a href="../cathen/13204a.htm">Pellegrino Rossi</a> and the riots before the Quirinal (25 November, 1848) counselled his flight to <a href="../cathen/06333a.htm">Gaeta</a>. The Triumvirate was formed and, on 6 February, 1849, convoked the Constituent Assembly, which declared the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> power abolished. The mob abandoned itself to the massacre of defenceless <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the wrecking of churches and palaces. Oudinot's French troops restored the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> power (6 August, 1849), the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> retaining a few French regiments. Secret plotting went on, though at Rome none dared attempt anything (the Fausti trial). Only in 1867, when Garibaldi, the victor at Monterotondo, defeated at Mentana, invaded the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, was the revolt prepared that was to have burst while Enrico Cairoi was trying to enter the city; but the <em>coup de main</em> failed; the stores of arms and ammunition were discovered; the only serious occurrence was the explosion of a mine, which destroyed the Serristori Barracks in the Borgo. Not until 20 September, 1870, was Rome taken from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and made the actual capital of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>.
<h2 id="section3">Churches and other monuments</h2>

<p>The "Annuario Ecclesiastico" enumerates 358 public churches and <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> in Rome and its suburbs. Besides, there are the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, colleges, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and other institutions. Since 1870 many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> have been destroyed, but many new ones have arisen in the new quarters.

<p>The principal patriarchal <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> are <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm"><em>St. Peter's</em></a> (the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Vatican Basilica</a>), <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm"><em>St. John Lateran</em></a> (the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">Basilica</a> of Constantine), and <em>St. Mary Major</em> (the <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberian</a> <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">Basilica</a>).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11361c.htm">Liberian Basilica</a> dates from the fourth century, when it was called the Basilica Sicinini; in the fifth century, under <a href="../cathen/14032a.htm">Sixtus III</a>, it was adorned with interesting <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of Biblical subjects; <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugene III</a> added the portico, when the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> were restored and, to some extent, altered. On the two sides are two <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> with <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupolas</a>: that of <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>, containing the altar of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> and <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a>; the other, that of <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>, with the Madonna of St. Luke, which existed as early as the sixth century. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> caused it to be restored by Fuga (1743), who designed the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> which now almost shuts out the view of the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>. Beneath the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>, the <em>baldacchino</em> of which is supported by four porphyry columns, are the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Matthew and of the <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">Holy Crib (hence</a> the name, <em>S. Maria ad pr&oelig;sepe</em>). Here are buried <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, <a href="../cathen/04028a.htm">IX</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">X</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>. (<em>See also</em> <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">SAINT PAUL-OUTSIDE-THE-WALLS</a>.)

<p>Among the lesser <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> is <em>S. Croce in Gerusalemme (Basilica Sessoriana)</em>, founded, it is said, by St. Helena in the place called the Sessorium, restored by Lucius II (1144) and by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (1743). Here, in the tribune, is the fresco of <a href="../cathen/12103b.htm">Pinturicchio</a> representing the Finding of the Cross, and here are preserved the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the Cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the Title, one of the Thorns, the finger of St. Thomas, etc. The church is served by <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, however, has been converted into barracks.

<p><em>St. Lawrence-Outside-the-Walls</em>, another minor basilica, which stands in the Cemetery of S. Ciriaco, where the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was buried, was built under Constantine and, next to St. Peter's, was the most frequented sanctuary in Rome at the end of the fourth century (see Prudentius's description). <a href="../cathen/11603a.htm">Pelagius II</a> (578), <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> made thorough repairs in this basilica, the last-named adding frescoes by Fracassini, representing the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>. The frescoes of the atrium date from the thirteenth century. The <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> stands beneath a raised <a href="../cathen/01381e.htm">ambo</a>, behind which is the simple <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of the triumphal arch date from the time of <a href="../cathen/11603a.htm">Pelagius II</a>. Near this basilica is the Cemetery of Rome, constructed in 1837, and surpassed by few in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> for the sumptuousness of its monuments. Both the church and the cemetery are served by Capuchina.

<p><em>St. Sebastian-Outside-the-Walls</em>, near the cemetery <em>ad catacumbas</em> (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">CATACOMBS</a>), built in the fourth or fifth century and altered in 1612, contains <a href="../cathen/06564c.htm">Giorgini's</a> <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. The churches so far named are the "Seven Churches" usually visited by <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> and residents to gain the large <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> attached to them.

<p><em>S. Agnese fuori le Mura</em>, near the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> of the same name, was built, by Constantine, decorated by Pope Symmachus with <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>, in which that <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> portrait appears, and restored by Honorius II (portrait), by Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere (1479), and by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>. It is served by <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> of St. John Lateran. In one of the adjacent buildings <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, in 1856, fell with the flooring of a room, but without suffering any injury.

<p>Not far off is <em>S. Costanza</em>, the mausoleum of <a href="../cathen/04295a.htm">Constantine's</a> daughter, which was made into a church in 1256. <em>S. Giorgio in Velabro</em>, <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman's</a> diaconal title, takes its name from the ancient Velabrum, where it stands, and dates from the fourth century; it has a fine tabernacle, but the church is much damaged by damp. <em>S. Lorenzo in Damaso</em>, built by Pope Damasus (370), was, in the time of <a href="../cathen/02736a.htm">Bramante</a>, enclosed in the palace of the Cancelleria; it contains modern frescoes and the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of Annibale Caro and <a href="../cathen/13204a.htm">Pellegrino Rossi</a>. <em>S. Maria ad Martyres</em> (the Pantheon) is a grandiose circular building with a portico. It was built in 25 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> by Marcus Agrippa and has often been restored; in 662 Constantine II caused the bronze which covered its <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a> to be taken away; it contains the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>, <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Cardinal Consalvi</a> and Kings Victor Emmanuel II and Humbert I. <em>S. Maria in Cosmedin</em>, which stands on the foundations of a <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of Hercules and a granary, dates from the sixth century at latest; it was a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> and the seat of the Greek colony, and was restored by <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Adrian I</a>, <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01255a.htm">Cardinal Albani</a> (1718), and at last was remodelled in its original form. It has a noteworthy <a href="../cathen/01381e.htm">ambo</a> and tabernacle (c. 130), and its campanile, with seven intercolumnars, is the most graceful in Rome. This was the title of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Reginald Cardinal Pole</a>. <em>S.

Its <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> is occupied by a section of the Ministry of War. <em>S. Carlo al Corso</em>, the church of the Lombards, was built by the Lunghi for the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>, on the site of a little church dedicated to S. Niccolo del Tufo. The decorations of the <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> are by <a href="../cathen/02516a.htm">Pietro da Cortona</a>; there is a picture by <a href="../cathen/09636c.htm">Maratta</a> and a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Judith by Le Brun. The <a href="../cathen/13198a.htm">Rosminians</a> have officiated in this church for some years past. <em>S. Claudio dei Borgognoni</em> is served by the Congregation of the Most Holy Sacrament; it has Exposition all the year around.

<p><em>S. Clemente</em>, the church of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> (1643), and titular church of William Cardinal O'Connell, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, existed as early as the fourth century, dedicated to St. Clement, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. It is characterized by the two <a href="../cathen/01381e.htm">ambos</a> which project about half way down the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> and an atrium which is also the courtyard of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> which stands in front of the basilica. The <a href="../cathen/01381e.htm">ambos</a> date from <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a> (872); the altar and tabernacle, from Paschal II. The church was destroyed in the conflagration kindled by <a href="../cathen/07072b.htm">Robert Guiscard</a> (1084); its rebuilding was begun immediately, but the plan was adopted of raising somewhat the pavement of the old church, which was filled in with debris; the new church was also less spacious. At this period the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> were executed. In the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of st. Catherine are some frescoes attributed to <a href="../cathen/09768a.htm">Masaccio</a> (1428); in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of Cardinals Brusati and Roverella; in that of St. Cyril, who is buried in the basilica, modern frescoes. In 1858 the excavation of the old basilica was begun, through the efforts of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> prior, Mulhooly. The frescoes, seventh to eleventh century, are important; in them may be distinguished the first indications of a new birth of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a>, and particularly interesting are those relating to Sts. Cyril and Methodius. The original basilica was raised upon the remains of a still earlier building, in which, moreover, there was a <em>spel&oelig;um</em>, or grotto, of <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithras</a>; it is probable that this building was St. Clement's paternal home. <em>Santissima Concenzione</em>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, near the Piazza Barberini, was built by the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> Cardinal Barberini, twin brother of <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> (1624). <a href="../cathen/04491b.htm">Bl. Crispin of Viterbo</a> is buried here. The church is noted for a <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">St. Michael</a> by <a href="../cathen/12771a.htm">Guido Reni</a>, a St. Francis by <a href="../cathen/05102b.htm">Domenichino</a>, a St. Felix of Cantalico by Turchi, and other pictures by Sacchi and <a href="../cathen/02516a.htm">Pietro da Cortona</a>. Beneath the church is the <em>ossarium</em> of the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>. <em>Sts. Cosmas and Damian</em>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Tertiaries, is made up of two ancient buildings, the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> of Romulus, son of <a href="../cathen/10073b.htm">Maxentius</a>, and of the Sacra Urbs, which were given to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> and converted into a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> by <a href="../cathen/06031a.htm">Felix IV</a> (528), to whom are due the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> and the arch, retouched in the ninth and sixteenth centuries. <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> caused its pavement to be raised ten feet. In the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> are the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/06030b.htm">Felix II</a> and some objects belonging to the old church.

<p><em>St. Crisogono</em>, Trinitarians, dates at least as far back as the fifth century, and was restored by Cardinal Scipione Borghese (1623). It has a fine tabernacle and, in the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a>, <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> by Cavillini (1290). Excavations have recently been made under this church, which is associated with English history as having been the titular church of Cardinal Langton. <em>S. Cuore al Castro Pretorio</em>, <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesians</a>, a fine church built in 1887 by Vespegniani, is due to the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Don Bosco. Connected with it is a boarding-school of arts and industries. <em>S. Francesca Romana</em> (S. Maria Nova), <a href="../cathen/11244c.htm">Olivetans</a>, was erected by <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Leo IV</a> in place of S. Maria Antiqua, which was in danger of being injured by the ruins of the Palatine, on a portion of the ruined temple of Venus and Rome, where once stood a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> commemorating the fall of <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>. It was restored by <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> and under <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> are <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of 1161; in the confession, the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/06205c.htm">St. Frances of Rome</a> (1440).

Francesco a Ripa</em>, the provincialate of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> (1229), has pictures by the Cavaliere d'Arpino and by Sabiati (Annunciation), and the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Lodovico Albertoni, one of <a href="../cathen/02510b.htm">Bernini's</a> best works. <em>S. Francesco di Paola</em> belongs to the Minims, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> being now occupied by a technical institute.

<p><em>The Ges&ugrave;</em>, connected with the professed house and general's residence of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, is the work of <a href="../cathen/15428a.htm">Vignola</a> (1568-73), completed by <a href="../cathen/12283b.htm">Giacomo della Porta</a>, through the munificence of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. It became the model of the style known as "Jesuit". Its altar of St. Ignatius, who is buried there, has a silver <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> which is ordinarily covered by a picture <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/12330c.htm">Pozzo</a>; the globe and four columns are of lapis lazuli Opposite is the altar of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, where an arm of that saint is preserved, and a picture by <a href="../cathen/09636c.htm">Maratta</a>.

The Madonna della Strada is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in one of the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. In this church are the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of Cardinal <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> and Ven.

The <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of <a href="../cathen/11590a.htm">St. Paul of the Cross</a> is modern. Under the church are still to be seen thirteen interstices of the house of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> with other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. This was the titular church of Edward Cardinal Howard, afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06243a.htm">Frascati</a> (died 1892). <em>S.

Marcello</em>, <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a>, is believed to be built over the stable in which Pope St. Marcellus was compelled to serve. It was restored in 1519 by order of Giuliano de' Medici (<a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>), completed in 1708 by Carlo Fontana, and contains <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Pierin del Vaga and Federico Zuccaro. It was the titular church of <a href="../cathen/15578c.htm">Thomas Cardinal Weld</a>. <em>S. Maria in Ara C&oelig;li</em>, on the Capitol, once the general's residence of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> (beginning from 1250), is (1911) the titular church of Cardinal Falconio. It stands on the site of the ancient citadel of Rome and the temple of Juno Moneta, and is approached by a flight of 124 steps. The <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> is still of brick, and the church contains antique columns and capitals; in the Buffalini <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> are frescoes (Life of St. Bernardino) by <a href="../cathen/12103b.htm">Pinturicchio</a>, and on the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> is a Madonna attributed to st. Luke, where was formerly the Madonna of <a href="../cathen/06124b.htm">Foligno</a>. To the left a small building, known as the Cappella Santa di Sant' Elena (Holy Chapel of St. Helena), marks the spot where, according to a legend winch can be traced to the ninth century, the <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Emperor Augustus</a> saw the Blessed Virgin upon an altar of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> (<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>ara c&oelig;li</em>). To this legend something was contributed by Virgil's fourth eclogue, in which he speaks of the "nova progenies" descending from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and which was interpreted in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity as a prophecy of the coming of Christ (thus Constantine in the sermon "Ad sanctorum c&oelig;tum"). In the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> the "Santo Bambino", a little figure of olive wood from the Mount of Olives (sixteenth century) for which the Romans have a great devotion. The sepulchral monuments of this church are numerous and important, including those of Cardinal Louis d'Albert, with figures of St. Michael and St. Francis; Michelangelo Marchese di Saluzzo, by Dosio; Pietro de' Vincenti, by <a href="../cathen/13453c.htm">Sansovino</a>; <a href="../cathen/07459a.htm">Honorius IV</a> and others of the Savelli <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in the Savelli <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, which dates from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries; Cardinal Matthew of Acquasparta; Catherine, Queen of Bosnia (1478). The Crib, built every year in the second <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> on the left, is famous; at <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> and Epiphany children recite dialogues and little discourses near it.

<p><em>S. Maria in Traspontina</em>, in the Borgo, Calced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, was erected by <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> on the site of a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> that had been built there, in 1099, to drive away the demons which haunted the ashes of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>. The architect was Meo del Caprina; <a href="../cathen/02736a.htm">Bramante</a> and <a href="../cathen/02510b.htm">Bernini</a> modified the building. It is one of the most beautiful monuments of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, its <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> being the first of its kind built in Rome. It contains <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="../cathen/12103b.htm">Pinturicchio</a> &#151; the Adoration of the Shepherds, all the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of the Lady Chapel and the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Augustine, the frescoes of the vault, etc. <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> designed the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of the Chigi <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and there are <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="../cathen/03374c.htm">Caracci</a>, <a href="../cathen/10569b.htm">Caravaggio</a> and <a href="../cathen/12104b.htm">Sebastiano del Piombo</a> (the Birth of the Blessed Virgin). The sepulchral monuments are costly including those of Giovanni della Rovere, Cardinal Costa, Cardinal Podocatharo, Cardinal Girolamo Basso, by <a href="../cathen/13453c.htm">Sansovino</a>, and Cardinal Sforza, by the same <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>, Agostino Chigi, in the Chigi <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> after suggestions, and decorated, by <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>, and Cardinal Pallavicino. The <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> windows, the most beautiful in Rome, are by Guillaume de Marcilot (1509). <em>S. Maria del Priorato</em>, Knights of Malta, on the Aventine, was built in 939, when Alberic II gave his palace to St. Odo of Cluny. The present form of the church, however, is due to <a href="../cathen/12107b.htm">Piranesi</a> (1765). Some of the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the grand masters of the Order of Malta &#151; Caraffa, Caracciolo, and others &#151; are interesting. The adjoining residence commands a splendid panorama. <em>S. Maria del Rosario</em>, on Monte Mario, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. <em>S. Maria della Scala</em>, Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, built by Francesco da Volterra, is so called from an image of the Madonna found under the stairs of a neighbouring house, and contains <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Saraceni and Gerhard Honthorst. In the adjoining <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, a great part of which is occupied by the Guardie di Pubblica Sicurezza, the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> have a pharmacy where they make the "Acqua della Scala". <em>S. Maria della Vittoria</em>, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, was erected by <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> in memory of the victory of the Imperialists over the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> at Prague (1623), and contains pictures by <a href="../cathen/05102b.htm">Domenichino</a>, Guercino, and Serra (1884), also a famous group by <a href="../cathen/02510b.htm">Bernini</a>, of St. Teresa transfixed by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> standards captured at the siege of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1683). <em>S. Maria in Aquiro</em>, the ancient <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> <em>titulus Equitii</em>, was restored in 1590. It was formerly an asylum for the destitute; <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> gave it to the <a href="../cathen/14140a.htm">Somaschi</a> Brothers, who still have an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> there under the supervision of the municipality. <em>S. Maria in Campitelli</em> was built in 1665 to receive the image of S. Maria in Portica (now S. Galla) in thanksgiving for Rome's deliverance from the plague (1658). It contains a picture of <a href="../cathen/01538a.htm">St. Anne</a>, by <a href="../cathen/06564b.htm">Luca Giordano</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/11380b.htm">Cardinal Pacca</a>. It is served by the <a href="../cathen/04052b.htm">Clerics Regular of the Mother of God</a>.

<p><em>S. Maria in Vallicella</em> (the Chiesa Nuova, or "New Church"), <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians of St. Philip Neri</a>, is associated with the spiritual renewal of the City by the labours of St. Philip, who founded it. The frescoes of the vaulting and of the <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> are by <a href="../cathen/02516a.htm">Pietro da Cortona</a>, the three pictures of the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> by <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a>, and others by Scipione Gaetano, Cavaliere d'Arpino Maratta, <a href="../cathen/12771a.htm">Guido Reni</a> (St. Philip), Ronocelli, and <a href="../cathen/02303a.htm">Baroccio</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> is rich in votive offerings; in the adjoining house, until now almost entirely occupied by the Assize Court, is his cell, with <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> and souvenirs of him. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> (Vallicelliana) now belongs to the State. <em>S. Maria in Via</em>, <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a> is a fine church of the late <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> (1549). <em>S. Maria Maddalena</em>, Servants of the Sick (formerly their generalate), is now occupied by the elementary communal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Here the cell of St. Camillus of Lellis is preserved, with the crucifix which encouraged him to found his order. <em>S. Maria Sopra Minerva</em>, the only authentic <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> in Rome, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, who had their general staff and their higher <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the adjoining <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, now the Ministry of Instruction, as well as the Casanatense Library, now in the hands of the State. This was the titular church of the <a href="../cathen/07502c.htm">Cardinal of Norfolk</a>, Cardinal McCloskey, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of New York, and <a href="../cathen/14462b.htm">Cardinal Taschereau</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Quebec (see JOHN MCCLOSKEY; ELZ&Eacute;AR ALEXANDRE TASCHEREAU); its title is now (1911) held by Cardinal Farley, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of New York. The church stands on the ruins of a <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of Minerva, one of those built by Pompey. In the eighth century there was a Greek <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> here. In 1280 Fra Sisto and Fra Ristoro, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, began the new church by order of <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a>, and with the aid of the Caetani, Savelli, and Orsini. It was completed in 1453. The pillars of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> are clustered columns; the side <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> are in <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> or <a href="../cathen/02303b.htm">baroque style</a>. Beneath the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> rests the body of <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Annunziata has a confraternity, founded by Cardinal Torquemada, which every year distributes dowries to 400 poor young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and there is a picture by Antoniazzo Romano dealing with the subject. The Caraffa <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Thomas contains frescoes by <a href="../cathen/09278a.htm">Filippo Lippi</a> (1487-93); that of St. Dominic, pictures by Maratta; of the Rosary, by Venusti. There are also <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Baronio and others. The <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the Risen Christ is by <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>. Here also are the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of Giovanni Alberini (1490), <a href="../cathen/15218a.htm">Urban VII</a>, by Buonvicino, the Aldobrandini <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> by <a href="../cathen/12283b.htm">Giacomo della Porta</a>, <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>, by Sigorio and Casignola, Gulielmus Durandus, by Giovanni di Cosma (1296), Cardinal Domenico Capranica (1458), <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> and <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, by Baccio Bandienelli, Blessed Angelico, of <a href="../cathen/06070a.htm">Fiesole</a>, with an epitaph by <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>, and Cardinal Sch&ouml;nberg (1537).

<p><em>S. Martino ai Monti</em>, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, probably dates from the time of Constantine, when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Equitius built an oratory on his own land. Symmachus rebuilt it, dedicating it to St. Silvester and <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>, and then again to St. Martin, Pope. In 1559 it was given to the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, who in 1650 remodelled it. It is notable for its landscapes by <a href="../cathen/12322c.htm">Poussin</a>. Under the more modern church is the old <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Silvester, with remains of <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>, frescoes, etc. <em>Our Lady of the Sacred Heart of Jesus</em> (formerly <em>S. Giacomo degli Spagnuoli</em>), in the Piazza Navona, belongs to the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart, who have an apostolic school there. <em>S. Onofrio</em> on the Janiculum, <a href="../cathen/07345a.htm">Hieronymites</a>, was built in 1439 by the de Cupis <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and Nicol&ograve; da Forca Palena. The frescoes of the portico are by <a href="../cathen/05102b.htm">Domenichino</a>, three scenes from the life of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>; within are frescoes by <a href="../cathen/11738a.htm">Baldassare Peruzzi</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of <a href="../cathen/10270b.htm">Cardinal Mezzofanti</a> and the poet <a href="../cathen/14463d.htm">Tasso</a>, who died in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, where his cell contains a small museum of objects that belonged to him. <em>S. Pancrazio fuori le Mura</em> was built by Pope Symmachus (c. 504) near the C&oelig;meterium Calepodii; in 1849 it was wrecked by the Garibaldians; the government caused it to be freshly decorated. Near <em>S. Pancrazio degli Scolopii</em> is the generalate of the <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarists</a> (<em>Scolopii</em>). <em>S. Paolo alle Tre Fontane</em> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a>, who have put the surrounding land under cultivation. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> contains three churches. The oldest, <em>SS. Vincenzo e Anastasio</em>, founded by Honorius I, came into the hands of Greek <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> restored and assigned it, with the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>. There is a fine <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> adjacent to this church, the earliest example of its kind. <em>S. Maria Scala C&oelig;li</em>, ninth century, was rebuilt in 1590 by <a href="../cathen/12283b.htm">Giacomo della Porta</a>, and contains a <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> by Francesco Zucca. <em>S. Paolo alle Tre Fontana</em> was built by the same <a href="../cathen/12283b.htm">Giacomo della Porta</a> (1599) on the three springs which appeared, as the legend says, on the three places successively touched by the head of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, who was beheaded here. The springs, however, existed before <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> as the Aqu&aelig; Salvi&aelig;, and in 1869 some ancient <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> pavements were dug up here. <em>S. Pietro in Montorio</em>, <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>, was in earlier days known as S. Maria in Castro Aureo, and had connected with it a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which passed into the hands of various orders until, in 1472, it was given to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> for the training of subjects for the foreign missions. Ferdinand the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> had the church and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> rebuilt, and they were dedicated to St. Peter, following a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> which had gained acceptance owing to a somewhat unfortunate conjecture hazarded by Maffeo Vegio, and which is even yet keenly debated. The rose-window of the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> is very fine and there are frescoes and other <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="../cathen/12104b.htm">Sebastiano del Piombo</a> (the Flagellation), <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a>, <a href="../cathen/15504a.htm">Daniele da Volterra</a>, Baluren. (the Entombment), and others; <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael's</a> Transfiguration is on the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>, and there is a beautiful balustrade. Here, too, are the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of Cardinals Fabiano and Antonio del Monte (Ammannati), and of Giuliano, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12633c.htm">Ragusa</a> (Dosio). In the courtyard of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, on the spot where St. Peter is supposed by some to have been crucified, stands <a href="../cathen/02736a.htm">Bramante's</a> <em>tempietto</em> the most graceful work of that genius. A splendid view of Rome may be had from the piazza in front of the church. It was the titular church of <a href="../cathen/04564a.htm">Paul Cardinal Cullen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>.

<p><em>S. Pietro in Vincoli</em>, <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> of St. John Lateran, existed as the <em>titulus Apostolorum</em> as early as 431. <a href="../cathen/14032a.htm">Sixtus III</a> made alterations in the church with funds given him by the Empress Eudoxia, who also presented the <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> chain of St. Peter together with his Roman chain. These <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> had been <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> here long before <a href="../cathen/14032a.htm">Sixtus III</a>, but the title, <em>a vinculis S. Petri</em>, occurs for the first time only in 530. Filings from the chains were given as <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> &#151; like those taken to <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> by Bishop Achilles in 419. The chains themselves are kept in a precious <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> attributed to <a href="../cathen/12216a.htm">Pollaiulo</a>. The church was restored by <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> and <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>. Its twenty monolithic columns are antique, and it contains pictures by Guercino and <a href="../cathen/05102b.htm">Domenichino</a> (The Deliverance of St. Peter) a <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> (St. Sebastian) of about the year 680, and the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>, with the celebrated <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Moses, and of <a href="../cathen/11060b.htm">Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa</a>, with a portrait in relief. In the adjoining <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> the <em>scuola di applicazione</em> of the Engineers is established. <em>S. Prassede</em>, <a href="../cathen/15262a.htm">Vallombrosans</a>, was built by Paschal II (822) at some distance from the older S. Prassede which, then in ruins, was restored by <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> and <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>. Its twenty-two antique columns are still standing, and there are interesting <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of the ninth century (the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Zeno and the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a>) and the thirteenth century (the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a>). In the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> are antique sarcophagi with the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of Sts. Praxedes, Pudentiana, and others, and Paschal caused the bones of 2300 (?) <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, brought by him from the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>, to be laid in an enclosed cemetery. There are pictures by <a href="../cathen/06572a.htm">Giulio Romano</a>, Federico Zuccaro, and the Cavaliere d'Arpino. <em>Santi Quaranta in Trastevere</em> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. <em>Santi Quattro Coronati</em>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, was the <em>Titulus &AElig;milian&oelig;</em> as early as the fourth century, and is dedicated to four soldiers (<em>cornicularii</em>) who were <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> on the Via Labicana, with whom were afterwards associated five <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, stonecutters of Pannonia. Honorius built a vast basilica, which, however, Paschal II reduced to the proportions of what had been the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>. There are remains of the older basilica in the two atria and, in the church, frescoes by Giovanni Manozzi and a <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a> by Capponi (1493). Annexed to this church is the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Corporation of Stonecutters, with pictures of the thirteenth century. The Augustinian Sisters have a refuge for young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> adjoining the church. <em>S. Sabina all' Aventino</em>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, built under <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">Clement I</a> by the Illyrian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Petrus (424), is remarkable for a half-door decorated with wood-carving of the fifth century, while its columns of Parian marble were taken from the temple of Diana on the Aventine. In the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> and above the door are <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>, and the picture by <a href="../cathen/13485b.htm">Sassoferrato</a> (the Madonna of the Rosary) is famous. In the adjoining <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, formerly the Savelli palace, are shown the cells of St. Dominic and <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a>.

<p><em>S. Salvatore della Scala Santa</em>, <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a>, contains, according to the legend, the stairs of <a href="../cathen/12404a.htm">Pilate's pr&aelig;torium</a>, which were bathed with the Blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but of which there is no mention earlier than 845. By these stairs, which were restored by <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a> and by Cosmas II, <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> ascend on their knees (<em>ginocchioni</em>) to the Cappella Sancta Sanctorum, in which the most famous <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the pontifical palace of the Lateran are preserved (see <a href="../cathen/13505a.htm">SCALA SANCTA</a>). There is a ninth-century <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> picture and a very ancient picture of the Saviour, on cedarwood, believed to have been made not by human hands. <em>S. Silvestro in Capite</em>, Pallottini (see <a href="../cathen/12107a.htm">PIOUS SOCIETY OF MISSIONS</a>), built by <a href="../cathen/11577a.htm">Paul I</a> (761) in his paternal home, was given to some Greek <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and subsequently passed into the possession of various orders. It was restored by Domenico de Rossi in 1681, and has a <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> by Rinaldo. This is, in a sense, the national church of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Its <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> has now become the Postal Department. <em>S.

Giuseppe a Capo le Case</em> with its <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Andrea Sacchi (St. Teresa) and <a href="../cathen/05102b.htm">Domenichino</a> (St. Joseph), has a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite Sisters</a> which is now used as a museum of the industrial arts. <em>S. Giuseppe dei Falegnami</em> is built upon the ancient Tullian Dungeon, where, according to tradition, St. Peter was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>.

<p><em>S. Lorenzo in Lucina</em> preserves the gridiron on which <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. It is believed that here was the house of the matron, Lucina, so often mentioned in the Acts of Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; this house was transformed by <a href="../cathen/14032a.htm">Sixtus III</a> into a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> which was repeatedly restored. It has a fine campanile, a picture by <a href="../cathen/12771a.htm">Guido Reni</a> (The Crucifixion), and the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/12322c.htm">Poussin</a>. <em>S.

Marco</em>, enclosed within the Palazzo di Venezia, is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of that name (336). The Rogation procession (25 April), instituted by <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo the Great</a>, used to set out from this church. It was restored in the ninth century, in the fifteenth century, and by <a href="../cathen/12614d.htm">Cardinal Quirini</a> in 1727. In the tribune are <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of the time of <a href="../cathen/06789b.htm">Gregory IV</a>; there are also pictures by Palma il Giovane and <a href="../cathen/10169c.htm">Melozzo da Forli</a>; two ciboria, in the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>, one of the twelfth century, the other by <a href="../cathen/16063c.htm">Mino da Fiesole</a>; the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of <a href="../cathen/11738b.htm">Pesaro</a>, by <a href="../cathen/03298b.htm">Canova</a>, and of Cardinal Gregorio Barbarigo. <em>S. Maria degli Angeli</em> was built by <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a> at the command of <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, within the baths of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>. The church was given to the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>. Here are to be seen many of the original designs for the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> now in St. Peter's; also Houdon's famous <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> and Cardinal Serbelloni. The adjoining <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> now contains the Museo Nazionale delle Terme.

<p><em>S. Maria della Pace</em>, the titular church of Michael Cardinal Logue, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, commemorates the peace concluded in 1482 between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. It was built for <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> by <a href="../cathen/02516a.htm">Pietro da Cortona</a>, who added a beautiful semicircular portico in front. In the Chigi <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> are the famous Sibyls of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>; there are also frescoes by <a href="../cathen/11738a.htm">Peruzzi</a>. The adjoining <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (Canons Regular of the Lateran) contains a courtyard by <a href="../cathen/02736a.htm">Bramante</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the St. Paul's Association of the Clergy of Rome. <em>S. Maria in Campo Marzio</em> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Sisters. <em>S. Maria di Loreto</em>, an octagonal church with a <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a>, is the work of Antonio da Sangallo il Giovane (1507), and has a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of St. Susanna by <a href="../cathen/05206b.htm">Duquesnoy</a>. The Churches of <em>S. Maria de' Miracoli</em> and <em>S. Maria di Monte Santo</em> were built in 1662 by Cardinal Gastaldo, and form the termination of three streets &#151; the Ripetta, the Corso Umberto and the Babuino &#151; which lead from the Piazza del Popolo. <em>S. Maria dell' Orto</em> (1489) is the fruit-vendors' church. <em>S. Maria in Trivio</em>, in the Piazza di Trevi, has a beautiful <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of the fifteenth century. <em>S. Maria in Lata</em>, a very ancient <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a>, stood near the Arch of Diocletian, but was destroyed in 1485; its present subterranean form is due to <a href="../cathen/02516a.htm">Pietro da Cortona</a>. Here, according to the legend, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and St. Mark were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, and here are the remains of the <em>S&oelig;pta Julia</em> and of the ancient basilica, with some frescoes. <em>Santi Martina e Luca</em>, in the Forum, occupies the site of the Secretarium Senatus; it existed before the seventh century and contained the body of <a href="../cathen/09730a.htm">St. Martina</a> the Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>; in 1640 the new church was built above the old by <a href="../cathen/02516a.htm">Pietro da Cortona</a> (who made a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/09730a.htm">St. Martina</a>), and was dedicated to St. Luke, being the church of the Academy of St. Luke. <em>Santi Nereo e Achilleo</em>, on the Appian Way, a very ancient church, contains <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of the time of <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Leo III</a> and an <a href="../cathen/01381e.htm">ambo</a> of the thirteenth century. <em>S. Nicola in Carcere</em> stands on the ruins of the three <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> of Pietas, Juno Sospita, and Spes. <em>Santissimo Nome di Maria</em>, in Trajan's Forum, was built to commemorate the deliverance of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> (1683). One Church of <em>SS. Pietro e Marcellino</em> stands in the Via Merulana; the other is outside the walls, on the Labicana, near the mausoleum of St. Helena. <em>S. Prisca</em>, on the Aventine, occupies the site of the temple of Diana Aventina. The legend has it that Priscilla, the wife of <a href="../cathen/01661a.htm">Aquila</a>, mentioned in the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> as entertaining St. Peter, lived here.

<p><em>S. Pudenziana</em>, again, is associated with memories of St. Peter: it was the mansion of the senator, Pudens, whose daughters, Pudentiana and Praxedes, gave it to <a href="../cathen/12126b.htm">St. Pius I</a>, and from that time it became a church. Since the time of Siricius (384) it has had the form of a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a>, and its <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> has been adorned with the most beautiful <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> in Rome. It was restored in 1598, and a <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> was added with frescoes by Roncalli. At the altar of St. Peter is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> the wooden table which St. Peter used for the celebration of the Eucharist. There is a marble group of Christ giving the keys to St. Peter, by <a href="../cathen/12283b.htm">Giacomo della Porta</a>. The title of S. Pudenziana was borne by <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Nicholas Cardinal Wiseman</a>, first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>. <em>S. Saba</em>, on the Aventine, existed in the time of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, whose mother retired to a spot near by. To her were dedicated some ancient frescoes recently brought to light. That it was even then the abode of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> is indicated by the name <em>cella</em> and by an ancient burial-place of an earlier date (c. 649). Here a community of Greek <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> was installed until the ninth century. After that it passed to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, and then to the German College, which still possesses it. <em>S. Salvatore in Lauro</em>, the church of the Sodality of the Piceni, earlier than the thirteenth century, was restored in 1450 and in 1591. It has a fine <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of Maddalena Orsini and of <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> (transferred hither from St. Peter's), the work of Isaia da Pisa. <em>S. Sisto Vecchio</em>, earlier than the sixth century, has a fine campanile and frescoes of the fifteenth century. Here was the first house of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> in Rome. The title was borne by <a href="../cathen/08788b.htm">Cardinal Langham</a>*, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> (see <a href="../cathen/08788b.htm">SIMON LANGHAM</a>). <em>S. Spirito in Sassia</em> is so called because in this quarter (the Borgo) an Anglo-Saxon colony led by King Ina, was established, with a church called S. Maria in Saxia. In 1201 <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> built a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">foundling institute</a> which was entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> of the Holy Ghost. <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> removed the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> had the present church built by Antonio da Sangallo il Giovane (1544); but the campanile dates from <a href="../cathen/03187a.htm">Callistus III</a>. The residence of the superior (Palazzo del Commendatore dello Spedale) is adjacent to the church, but about half of it has been pulled down for the construction of the Victor Emmanuel Bridge. <em>S. Stefano Rotondo</em>, built by <a href="../cathen/14002a.htm">Pope Simplicius</a> on the foundations of an ancient building consisting of three, concentric circles divided by two rings of twenty columns in all, is decorated with frescoes by Pomarancio and Tempesta. It was the titular church of <a href="../cathen/02372a.htm">Cardinal Beaton</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of St. Andrews, and now belongs to the German College. <em>S. Susanna</em>, dedicated to the Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of that name, dates back to the fourth century. In its restoration by <a href="../cathen/09513a.htm">Maderno</a> (1600) the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of 796 perished, and it was decorated with frescoes by Croce. It was the titular church of <a href="../cathen/14366a.htm">Cardinal Moran</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a>. <em>S. Teodoro</em>, at the foot of the Palatine, also stands on a circular structure, an ancient <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a>. It has a <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> of the time of <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Adrian I</a>. <em>Santissima Trinit&agrave; dei Monti</em> is said to have been built through the munificence of Charles VIII of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Its great flight of stairs, leading from the Piazza di Spagna, was built by order of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>. It contains fine pictures of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/11737b.htm">Perugino</a>, also by <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>, Pierin del Vaga, <a href="../cathen/15322a.htm">Veit</a>, <a href="../cathen/15504a.htm">Daniele da Volterra</a> (Taking down from the Cross). The church belongs to the Ladies of the Sacred Heart who have an institution (1827) in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of which is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> the <em>Ter Admirabilis</em> (Thrice Admirable) Madonna. Of the churches outside the City special mention should be made of the sanctuary of the <em>Madonna del Divino Amore</em> (of the Divine Love) on the Via Ardeatina, near an old castle of the Orsini, which is visited by a great concourse of people ou Whit-Monday.

Moreover there are eight <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> churches intended for propaganda work, each having one or two halls, known as <em>sale cristiane</em>, connected with it while five others are principally for the benefit of foreigners, and the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> have decided to build one more. The Orthodox Russians, too, have a church, where the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Kronstadt officiates. The Hebrews have a large new <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> and an oratory, besides a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of religious learning and various benevolent organizations.
<h3>Non-religious buildings</h3>

<p>The Palace of the Cancelleria, by <a href="../cathen/02736a.htm">Bramante</a>; the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> of <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> now occupied by the Italian Parliament; the Quirinal Palace, the king's residence, built by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> and enlarged by <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> and <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> formerly resided, and the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclaves</a> were held; the Palazzo di Giustizia, built by Calderari entirely of travertine; the Bank of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (Koch) and the Palazzo Buoncompagni, the residence of the queen-mother; the Palazzo Braschi (offices of the Ministry of Internal Affairs), Palazzi Capitolini (<a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>), Palazzo del Consulta (Ministry of Foreign Affairs), Villa Medici (<a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a>), Palazzo Venezia (Austrian Embassy), built by <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a>, Palazzo Corsini (Accademia dei Lincei), Palazzo Farnese (<a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>), now the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and occupied by the French Embassy. Among the private palaces are the Altieri (<a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a>), Barberini (<a href="../cathen/02510b.htm">Bernini</a>), Borghese (<a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>), Caetani (Ammannati), Pamfili, Esedra, Giraud (<a href="../cathen/02736a.htm">Bramante</a> &#151; now belonging to the Torlonia <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>), Massimo, Odescalchi, Farnesina (Sangallo), and Ruspoli. The chief private villas are the Doria Pamfili and the Massimo (frescoes by <a href="../cathen/11362a.htm">Overbeck</a>). Of all the public monuments we need mention only that recently inaugurated to the memory of Victor Emmanuel II at the back of the Capitoline Hill, consisting of a gilded equestrian <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, with a semicircular <a href="../cathen/04128c.htm">colonnade</a> behind it. The principal fountains are: the Acqua Paola, on the Janiculum (<a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>); the Piazza S. Pietro fountain, the Tartarughe (<a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>), the Fontana del Tritone (<a href="../cathen/02510b.htm">Bernini</a>), and, most magnificent of all, the Trevi (<a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a>, Nicol&agrave; Salvi).
<h3>Principal ancient edifices and monuments</h3>

<p>The Flavian Amphitheatre, or <a href="../cathen/04101b.htm">Colosseum</a>, begun by <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a>. Much of its material, particularly on the south side, has been pilfered, this destructive practice having been effectively stopped only in the eighteenth century. The Arch of Constantine was erected in 312 to commemorate the victory over <a href="../cathen/10073b.htm">Maxentius</a>, the decorations being, in part, taken from the Arch of Trajan. That of <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a>, on the Flaminian Way (Corso), was removed by <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>; its decorations are preserved in the Capitol. That of <a href="../cathen/13721a.htm">Septimius Severus</a> (203) is richly decorated with <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> and <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-reliefs</a>; that of Titus, commemorating his victory over the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, has the celebrated <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-relief</a> representing objects taken from the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple of Jerusalem</a>; that of Drusus (<a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>?) is near the Porta S. Sebastiano. The Arch of Dolabella (<font size=-2>A.D.</font> 10) is surmounted by three conduits taken from a branch of the Aqua Claudia. The Arch of <a href="../cathen/06366a.htm">Gallienus</a> dates from <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 262. The secular <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> are the &AElig;milian, or Fulvian (167 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), the Julian (54 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), the Basilica of Constantine (<font size=-2>A.D.</font> 306-10), and the Ulpian, on the Forum of Trajan, with which a <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was once connected.

<p>For <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> see <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">ROMAN CATACOMBS</a>. The most important <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> of the Hebrews are those of Vigna Randanini, on the Appian Way.

<p>The Circuses are: that of <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, now the Piazza Navona; the Flaminian (the Palazzo Mattei); the Circus Maximus, the oldest of all, erected in the Murcian Valley, between the Palatine and the Aventine, where, even in the days of Romulus, races and other public amusements used to be held (as on the occasion of the Rape of the Sabines); that of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, near St. Peter's, where the Apostle was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a>; that of <a href="../cathen/10073b.htm">Maxentius</a> outside the city, near the Via Appia. Trajan's Column on the forum of the same name, with a spiral design of the emperor's warlike exploits, is 100 Roman feet (about 97 English feet) in height, erected by the senate and people <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 113. That of <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a>, with reliefs showing the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with the Marcomanni, Quadi, Sarmati, etc. (172-75), is interesting for its representation of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> rainfall which, as early as <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian's</a> time, was attributed to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> soldiers. This column bears a bronze <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, as <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan's</a> is <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of St. Peter (<a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>, 1589). That of Phocas was erected in 608 by the <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a> Smaragdus. The Roman Forum was originally the swampy valley between the Palatine, Capitoline, and Esquiline, which became a market and a meeting-place for the transaction of public business. Soon it was surrounded with shops and public buildings &#151; <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> Hostilia, the Rostra, or platform for public speakers, and various <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>. Other forums were those of <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>, of Peace, of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, the Julian, and <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan's</a>, in the same neighbourhood.

<p>The Mausoleum of Augustus, between the Corso and the Via Ripetta, is now a concert hall. The Mausoleum of Hadrian (Castle of S. Angelo) was used as a fortress by <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> and Romans as early as the sixth century; in the tenth and following centuries it often served as a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> or compulsory, for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>; <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a>, <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> were the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> who did most to restore and transform it. The Tomb of C&aelig;cilia Metella, on the Via Appia, still fairly well preserved, was a stronghold of the Caetani in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and from them passed to the Savelli and the <a href="../cathen/04125c.htm">Colonna</a>. The Pyramid of Caius C&aelig;stius (time of <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>) is more than 120 feet in height. The <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Eurysaces, outside the Porta Maggiore, has interesting <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-reliefs</a> showing the various operations of baking bread. That of the Scipios, near the Gate of St. Sebastian, was discovered in 1780, with the sarcophagus of Scipio Barbatus, consul in 298 which is now in the Vatican Museum. The Appian Way was lined with numbers of sepulchral monuments; among these mention may be made here of the <em>columbaria</em>, or grottoes where a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> or an association was wont to deposit in niches the cinerary urns of its members. The most important of these are in the Vigna Codini and near S. Giovanni in Oleo.

<p>With <a href="../cathen/13721a.htm">Septimius Severus</a> a new <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> period was inaugurated, which was continued by <a href="../cathen/07206b.htm">Heliogabalus</a> and <a href="../cathen/13743a.htm">Alexander Severus</a>. The house of <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>, that of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, the hippodrome, the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, the house of Livia, the <em>p&oelig;dagogium</em>, or quarters of the imperial pages (where the celebrated drawing of a certain Alexamenos adoring a crucified ass was discovered)&mdash;all these are still clearly distinguishable. There were also a <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of the Great Mother (205 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), one of Jupiter Victor (295 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>&mdash;commemorating the victory of Sentinum), and one of Apollo, surrounded by a great portico in the enclosure of which now stands the Church of S. Sebastiano in Palladio. In the substructures of the palace of Caligula was discovered some years ago the ancient basilica of S. Maria Antiqua, probably <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the fourth century, in which frescoes of the eighth and ninth centuries (including a portrait of Pope St. Zacharias, then living) were found. It is evident at certain points, where the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> have been broken, that two other layers of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> lie beneath. Other <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> are those of <a href="../cathen/04206a.htm">Concordia</a>, three columns of which are still standing in the Roman Forum, built in 388 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> for the peace between the Patricians and the Plebeians, and in which the Senate often assembled; of the Deus Rediculus, outside the city, near the Appian Way, on the spot where Hannibal, alarmed by a vision, resolved to retire without besieging Rome; of Castor and Pollux, built in 484 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> to commemorate the victory of Lake Regillus, over the Latins, and restored in 117 (three columns remaining); of Faustina and Antoninus (S. Lorenzo in Miranda); of Fortuna Virilis (second century <font size=-2>B. C.;</font> now the Church of St. <a href="../cathen/09763a.htm">Mary of Egypt</a>); of Julius C&aelig;sar, erected by <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> in the Forum, on the spot where C&aelig;sar's body was burned; of Jupiter Capitolinus, now the German Embassy; of Mars Ultor (the Avenger) erected in the Forum of Augustus to fulfil his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> made at the battle of <a href="../cathen/12007c.htm">Philippi</a>, where he avenged the assassination of C&aelig;sar; of Minerva Medica, which is, indeed, rather a nymph&aelig;um, or reservoir for distributing the water supply; of Neptune, with its stone piazza, now the Exchange; of Peace, built by <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> after his victory over the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; of Romulus (the son of <a href="../cathen/10073b.htm">Maxentius</a>) which now, like Sacr&aelig; Urbis temple (of the Holy City), forms part of Santi Cosmo e Damiano; of Saturn, in the Forum. The two <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> of Venus and Rome have their <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apses</a> touching each other, and were surrounded by a common peristyle, a plan designed by the <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Emperor Hadrian</a> himself; to the temple of Vesta, below the Palatine, is annexed the house of the Vestals; the small round temple of the Mater Matuba, in the Forum Boarium, has been commonly called Vesta's.

<p>Characteristic of Rome are the lofty brick towers generally square with few windows, winch may still be seen here and there throughout the city. They were built, for the most part, in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and are monuments of the discord between the most powerful <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of Rome. The most important of them are: the Torre Anguillara in Trastevere, adjoining the palace of the Anguillara <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, reconstructed and used as a <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> museum; the two Capocci towers, in the Via Giovanni Lanza; that of the Conti, once the largest and strongest, built by Riccardo, brother of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>; that of the Scimmia, or of the Frangipani, near S. Antonio dei Portoghesi surmounted by a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the Madonna; the Torre Millina, in the Via dell' Anima; the Torre Sanguigna. The Torre delle Milizie has been <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> called "Nero's Tower", that emperor being supposed to have watched from it the burning of Rome; it was built, however, under <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, by his sons Piero and Alessio, partisans of the senator Pandolfo, who opposed the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> brother Riccardo.
