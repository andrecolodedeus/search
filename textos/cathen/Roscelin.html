<h1>Roscelin</h1>  

<p>Roscelin, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Compi&egrave;gne, was teaching as early as 1087. He had contact with <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a>, <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08257a.htm">Ivo of Chartres</a>. Brought before a council at <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a> (1093), where he was accused of <a href="../cathen/15061b.htm">Tritheism</a>, he denied the doctrines attributed to him, but this was done through fear of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, for later he returned to his early theories. He was successively in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and finally returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Of his writings there exists only a letter addressed to <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a>. Haur&eacute;au brings forward his name in connection with a text: "Sententia de universalibus secundum magistrum R." ("Notices et extr. de quelques manuscr. lat.", V, Paris, 1892, 224) but this is a conjecture. On the other hand we have as evidences of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> texts of <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a>, <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a>, and an anonymous epigram. His share in the history of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and especially the value of his <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a> have been exaggerated, his celebrity being far more due to his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/15061b.htm">Tritheism</a>. This article will study him from both points of view.
<h2 id="section1">Roscelin's nominalism, or "sententia vocum"</h2>

<p>According to <a href="../cathen/11358b.htm">Otto of Freisingen</a> Roscelin "primus nostris temporibus sententiam vocum instituit" ("Gesta Frederici imp". in "Mon. Germ. Hist.: Script., XX, 376), but the chronicler of the "Historia Francia" (cf. Bouquet, "Rec. des hist. des Gaules et de la France", XII, Paris, 1781, 3, b, c) mentions before him a "magister Johannes", whose <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> is much discussed and who has not yet been definitively identified. What constitutes the sententia vocum"? To judge of it we have besides the texts mentioned above which bear directly on Roscelin an exposition of the treatise "De generibus et speciebus (thirteenth cent.), wrongly attributed to <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> by Victor Cousin. The "sententia vocum" was one of the anti-Realist solutions of the problem of <a href="../cathen/15182a.htm">universals</a> accepted by the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Resuming Porphyry's alternative (mox de generibus et speciebus illud quidem sive subsistent sive in nudis intellectibus posita sint) the first <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> regarded genera and species (substance, corporeity, animality, humanity) either as things or as having no existence (see NOMINALISM), and applying to this alternative a terminology of <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a>, they derived thence either res (things) or voces (words). To the <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalists</a> <a href="../cathen/15182a.htm">universals</a> were voces, which means: (1) above all that <a href="../cathen/15182a.htm">universals</a> are not "res", that is that only the individual exists: nam cum habeat eorum sententia nihil esse praeter individuum . . ." (De gener. et spec., 524). <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a> was essentially anti-Realist. (2) that <a href="../cathen/15182a.htm">universals</a> are merely words, "flatus vocis", e.g., the word "homo", divisible into syllables, consonants, and vowels. "Fuit autem, nemini magistri nostri Roscellini tam insana sententia ut nullam rem partibus constare vellet, sed sicut solis vocibus species, ita et partes ascridebat (Abelard, "Liber divisionum, ed. Cousin, 471). "Alius ergo consistit in vocibus, licet haec opinio cum Roscelino suo fere omnino evanuerit (<a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a>, Metalog., II, 17). The universal is reduced to an emission of sound (flatus vocis), in conformity with <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius's</a> definition: Nihil enim aliud est prolatio (vocis) quam aeris plectro linguae percussio . Roscelin's universal corresponds to what is now called the "universale in voce" in opposition to "universale in re" and "universale in intellectu".

<p>But this theory of Roscelin's had no connection with the abstract concept of genus and species. He did not touch on this question. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that he did not deny the existence or possibility of these concepts, and he was therefore not a nominalist in the fashion of Taine or in the sense in which <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a> is at present understood. That is why, in reference to the modern sense of the word, we have called it a pseudo-Nominalism. <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a>, speaking of "nominalis secta" (Metalog., II, 10) gives it quite another meaning. So Roscelin's rudimentary, even childish, solution does not compromise the value of universal concepts and may called a stage in the development of moderate Realism.

<p>Roscelin was also taken to task by <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> and <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> for the less clear <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> which he gave of the whole and of composite substance. According to <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> he maintained that colour does not exist independently of the horse which serves as its support and that the wisdom of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not outside of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is wise (De fide trinit., 2). He denies to the whole, such as house, man, real existence of its parts. The word alone had parts, "ita divinam paginam pervertit, ut eo loco quo Dominus partem piscis assi comedisse partem hujus vocis, quae est piscis assi, non partem rei intelligere cogatur (Cousin, P. Abaelardi opera, II. 151). Roscelin was not without his supporters; among them was his contemporary Raimbert of <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a>, and what the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> H&eacute;riman relates of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> agrees with the statements of the master of Compi&egrave;gne. Universal substances, says H&eacute;riman, are but a breath, which means eos de sapientium numero merito esse exsufflandos". He merely comments on the saying of Anselm characterized by the same jesting tone: a spiritualium quaestionum disputatione sunt exsufflandi" (P.L., 256a), and says that to understand the windy loquacity of Raimbert of <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a> one has but to breathe into his hand (manuque ori admota exsufflans "Mon. Germ. Hist.", XIV, 275).
<h2 id="section2">Tritheism of Roscelin</h2>

<p>Roscelin considered the three Divine Persons as three independent beings, like three <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; if usage permitted, he added, it might truly be said that there are three <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Gods</a>. Otherwise, he continued, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a> and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">God the Holy Ghost</a> would have become incarnate with <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">God the Son</a>. To retain the appearance of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> he admitted that the three Divine Persons had but one will and power [Audio . . . quod Roscelinus clericus dicit in tres personas esse tres res ab invicem separatas, sicut sunt tres angeli, ita tamen ut una sit voluntas et potestas aut Patrem et Spiritum sanctum esse incarnatum; et tres deos vere posse dici si usus admitteret (letter of <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> to Foulques)]. This characteristic <a href="../cathen/15061b.htm">Tritheism</a>, which <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> and <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> agreed in refuting even after its author's conversion, seems an indisputable application of Roscelin's anti-Realism. He argues that if the three Divine Persons form but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> all three have become incarnate, which is inadmissible. There are therefore three Divine substances, three <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Gods</a>, as there are three <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, because each substance constitutes an individual, which is the fundamental assertion of anti-Realism. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> are closely linked with those of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>.
