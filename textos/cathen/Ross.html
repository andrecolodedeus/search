<h1>Ross</h1>  

<p>(ROSSENSIS).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. This <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was founded by St. Fachtna, and the place-name was variously known as Roscairbre and Rosailithir (Ross of the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>). St. Fachtna founded the School of Ross as well as the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>; and his death occurred about 590, on 14 August, on which day his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated. The succession of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was uninterrupted till after the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> period. King John in 1207 granted the cantred of Rosailithir to David Roche, regardless of the claims of the native chief, the O'Driscoll, but the episcopal manors were left undisturbed. In 1306, the value of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <em>mensa</em> was 26 marks, while the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was valued at 3 marks; and the tribal revenue of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was but 45 pounds sterling. The number of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> was 29, divided into 3 divisions; and there was a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, Carrigilihy (<em>de fonte vivo</em>); also a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Priory at St. Mary's, Ross. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> acquired a foundation at Sherkin Island from the O'Driscolls in 1460. Owing to various causes the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was not in a flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> in the fourteenth century, and the Wars of the Roses contributed to the unfortunate state of affairs which prevailed in the second half of the fifteenth century. Blessed Thady MacCarthy was appointed Bishop in 1482, but was forcibly deprived of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1488. However he was translated to the united Sees of <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a> and Cloyne in 1490; was again a victim of political intrigues, and died a glorious confessor at <a href="../cathen/08258a.htm">Ivrea</a> in 1492, being <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> in 1895. In 1517 the revenue of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was but 60 marks. At that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the chapter was complete with 12 canons and 4 vicars, and there were 27 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, including three around Berehaven. Thomas O'Herlihy assisted at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, and ruled from 1562 till his death on 11 March, 1580. It was not until 1581 that Queen Elizabeth ventured to appoint a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> under whom, in 1584, the Sees of <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a> and Cloyne were annexed to Ross. However, in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> arrangement Ross continued independent, and Owen MacEgan died a confessor in January, 1602-3. In 1625 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (de Torres) was a <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, who ruled his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> through a <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. In 1647 the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> and tower of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> were levelled by the <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritans</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (MacEgan) was basely hanged by Lord Broghill, on 10 April, 1650. At length, in 1693, Bishop Sleyne of <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a> was given Ross <em><a href="../cathen/07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em>, and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> continued under his successors till 1748, when it was united to Cloyne under Bishop O'Brien. From 1748 Ross was administered by the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/04072a.htm">Cloyne</a>, but it regained its autonomy under Bishop Crotty, and in 1857 Bishop O'Hea was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to Ross. During the episcopate of Dr. O'Hea (the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population was then 65,000) the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> was transferred to Skibbereen, and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was materially improved under his fostering care. His successor, William Fitzgerald (1877-97) also labored <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a>. The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the Most Rev. Denis Kelly, was born near Nenagh, Co. Tipperary, in 1852, and was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Ennis and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He was appointed president of the Killaloe Diocesan College in 1890, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 9 May, 1897. Bishop Kelly has acted on several Royal commissions, and has recently (1911) been named one of the two commissioners for the projected Home Rule finance. In 1901 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population was 46,694, and there were eleven <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> &mdash; two of which were mensal&mdash;served by 28 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The latest returns give the number of churches as 22, and there are three Convents of Mercy, respectively, at Skibbereen, Clonakilty, and Rosscarbery. There is no chapter, but there are two vicars forane.
