<h1>Rule of Saint Augustine</h1>  

<p>The title, <em>Rule of Saint Augustine</em>, has been applied to each of the following documents: <ul><li>Letter 211 addressed to a community of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; <li>Sermons 355 and 356 entitled "De vit&acirc; et moribus clericorum suorum"; <li>a portion of the Rule drawn up for clerks or <em>Consortia monachorum</em>; <li>a Rule known as <em>Regula secunda</em>; and <li>another Rule called: "De vit&acirc; eremitic&acirc; ad sororem liber." </ul> The last is a treatise on <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">eremitical</a> life by Blessed &AElig;lred, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Rievaulx, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, who died in 1166 and as the two preceding rules are of unknown authorship, it follows that none but Letter 211 and Sermons 355 and 356 were written by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>. Letter 211 is addressed to <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> that had been governed by the sister of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, and in which his cousin and niece lived. His object in writing it was merely to quiet troubles, incident to the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of a new superior, and meanwhile he took occasion to expatiate upon some of the virtues and practices essential to the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. He dwells upon charity, poverty, obedience, detachment from the world, the apportionment of labour, the mutual <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of superiors and inferiors, fraternal charity, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in common, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and abstinence proportionate to the strength of the individual, care of the sick, silence, reading during meals, etc. In his two sermons "De vit&acirc; et moribus clericorum suorum" Augustine seeks to dispel the suspicions harboured by the faithful of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> against the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> leading a monastic life with him in his episcopal residence. The perusal of these sermons discloses the fact that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> observed strict poverty and conformed to the example of the Apostles and early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> by using their money in common. This was called the Apostolic Rule. St. Augustine, however, dilated upon the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> and its <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> on other occasions. Aurelius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, was greatly disturbed by the conduct of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who indulged in idleness under pretext of contemplation, and at his request .htm-->St. Augustine published a treatise entitled "De opere monarchorum" wherein he proves by the authority of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> the example of the Apostles, and even the exigencies of life, that the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to devote himself to serious labour. In several of his letters and sermons is found a useful complement to his teaching on the monastic life and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> it imposes. These are easy of access to <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> edition, where the accompanying table may be consulted under the words: <em>monachi, monachae, monasterism, monastica vita, sanctimoniales.</em>

<p>The letter written by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> at <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> (423), for the purpose of restoring harmony in their community, deals with the reform of certain phases of monasticism as it is understood by him. This document, to be sure, contains no such clear, minute prescriptions as are found in the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Benedictine Rule</a>, because no complete rule was ever written prior to the time of St. Benedict; nevertheless, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> is a law-giver and his letter if to be read weekly, that the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> may guard against or repent any infringement of it. He considers poverty the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, but attaches no less importance to fraternal charity, which consists in living in peace and concord. The superior, in particular, is recommended to practise this virtue although not, of course, to the extreme of omitting to chastise the guilty. However, .htm-->St. Augustine leaves her free to determine the nature and duration of the punishment imposed, in some cases it being her privilege even to expel <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> that have become incorrigible.

<p>The superior shares the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of her office with certain members of her community, one of whom has charge of the sick, another of the cellar, another of the wardrobe, while still another is the guardian of the books which she is authorized to distribute among the sisters. The <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> make their habits which consist of a dress, a <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a> and a veil. <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a>, in common, occupies an important place in their life, being said in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> at stated hours and according to the prescribed forms, and comprising <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, psalms and readings. Certain <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are simply recited while others, especially indicated, are chanted, but as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> enters into no minute details, it is to be supposed that each <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> conformed to the liturgy of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in which it is situated. Those sisters desiring to lead a more contemplative life are allowed to follow special devotions in private. The section of the rule that applies to eating, although severe in some respects, is by no means observance and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> tempers it most discreetly. Fasting and abstinence are recommended only in proportion to the physical strength of the individual, and when the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> speaks of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> he specifies such as are unable to wait the evening or ninth hour meal may eat at noon. The <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> partake of very frugal fare and, in all probability, abstain from meat. However, the sick and infirm are objects of the most tender care and solicitude, and certain concessions are made in favour of those who, before entering religion, led a life of luxury. During meals some instructive matter to be read aloud to the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. Although the Rule of St. Augustine contains but few <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>, it dwells at great length upon religious virtues and the ascetic life, this being characteristic of all primitive rules. In his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> 355 and 356 the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> discourses on the monastic observance of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty. Before making their profession the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> divest themselves of all their goods, their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> being responsible for supplying their wants, and whatever they may earn or receive is turned over to a common fund, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> having right of possession.



<p>In his treatise, "De opere monarchorum", he inculcates the necessity of labour, without, however, subjecting it to any rule, the gaining of one's livelihood rendering it indispensable. Monks of couse, devoted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ministry observe, <em>ipso facto</em>, the precept of labour, from which observance the infirm are legitimately dispensed. These, then, are the most important monastic prescriptions found in the rule of and writings of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>.
<h2>Monastic life of St. Augustine</h2>

<p>Augustine was a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>; this fact stands out unmistakably in the reading of his life and works. Although a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to combine the practices of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> with the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his office, and his episcopal house in Hippo was for himself and some of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, a veritable <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Several of his friends and disciples elevated to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a> imitated his example, among them Alypius at <a href="../cathen/14553b.htm">Tagaste</a>, Possidius at <a href="../cathen/03148c.htm">Calama</a>, Profuturus and Fortunatus at <a href="../cathen/04295a.htm">Cirta</a> Evodius at Uzalis, and Boniface at Carthage. There were still other <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who were <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and who exercised the ministry outside of the episcopal cities. All <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> did not live in these episcopal <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; the majority were <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> whose communities, although under the authority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, were entirety distinct from those of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. There were religious who lived in complete isolation, belonging to no community and having no legitimate superiors; indeed, some wandered aimlessly about, at the risk of giving disedification by their vagabondage. The fanatics known as <em><a href="../cathen/01223a.htm">Circumcelliones</a></em> were recruited from the ranks of these wandering <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> often censured their way of living.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> was, for a long time, a matter of dispute between the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Hermits of St. Augustine</a>, each of these two <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> claiming him exclusively as its own. It was not so much the establishing of an historical fact as the settling of a claim of precedence that caused the trouble, and as both sides could not in the right, the quarrel would have continued indefinitely had not the <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Pope Sixtus IV</a> put an end by his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Summum Silentium" (1484). The silence was imposed, however, was not perpetual, and the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were resumed between the Canons and the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">Hermits</a> but all to no avail. Pierre de Saint-Trond, Prior of the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> of St. Martin of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, tells the story of these quarrels in the Preface to his "Examen Testamenti S. Augustini" (Louvain, 1564). Gabriel Pennot, Nicolas Desnos and Le Large uphold the thesis of the Canons; Gandolfo, <a href="../cathen/09436c.htm">Lupus</a>, Giles of the Presentation, and <a href="../cathen/11103a.htm">Noris</a> sustain that of the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">Hermits</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> withhold their opinion. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> followed the monastic or <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> as it was known to his contemporaries and neither he nor they even thought of establishing among those who had embraced it any distinction whatever as to congregations or orders. This <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was conceived in a subsequent epoch, hence .htm-->St. Augustine cannot be said to have belonged to any particular order. He made <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of Roman Africa, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and he helped to increase their numbers, while they, in turn, revered him as their father, but they cannot be classed as members of any special monastic <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>.
<h2>St. Augustine's influence on monachism</h2>

<p>When we consider <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> great prestige, it is easy to understand why his writings should have so influenced the development of Western monachism. His Letter 211 was read and re-read by St. Benedict, who borrowed several important texts from it for insertion in his own rule. St. Benedict's chapter on the labour of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> is manifestly inspired by the treatise "De opere monachorum", that has done so much towards furnishing an accurate statement of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> commonly accepted in <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. The teaching concerning religious poverty is clearly formulated in the sermons "De vit&acirc; et moribus clericoreun suorum" and the authorship of these two works is sufficient to earn for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> the title of <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and religious. The influence of Augustine, however, was nowhere stronger than in southern Gaul in the fifth and sixth centuries. L&eacute;rins and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of that <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> were familiar with Augustine's monastic writings, which, together with those of Cassianus, were the mine from which the principal elements of their rules were drawn. St. Caesarius, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Arles, the great organizer of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> in that section chose a some of the most interesting articles of his rule for <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, and in his rule for <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> quoted at length from Letter 211. Sts. Augustine and Caesarius were animated by the same spirit which passed from the <a href="../cathen/03135b.htm">Archbishop of Arles</a> to St. Aurelian, one of his successors, and, like him, a monastic Iawgiver. Augustine's influence also extended to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women's</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, where the Rule of Caesarius was adopted either wholly or in part, as, for example, at Sainte-Croix of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, Juxamontier of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>, and Chamali&egrave;res near Clermont.

<p>But it was not always enough merely to adopt the teachings of Augustine and to quote him; the author of the <em>regula Tarnatensis</em> (an unknown <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the Rhone valley) introduced into his work the entire text of the letter addressed to the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, having previously adapted it to a community of men by making slight modifications. This adaptation was surely made in other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the sixth or seventh centuries, and in his "Codex regularum" <a href="../cathen/02467a.htm">St. Benedict of Aniane</a> published a text similarly modified.

<p>For want of exact information we cannot say in which <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> this was done, and whether they were numerous. Letter 211, which has thus become the Rule of St. Augustine, certainly constituted a part of the collections known under the general name of "Rules of the Fathers" and used by the founders of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> as a basis for the practices of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. It does not seem to have been adopted by the regular communities of canons or of clerks which began to be organized in the eighth and ninth centuries. The rule given them by <a href="../cathen/03729b.htm">St. Chrodegang</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> (742-766), is almost entirely drawn from that of St. Benedict, and no more decided traces of Augustinian influence are to be found in it than in the decisions of the Council of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> (817), which may be considered the real constitutions of the canons Regular. For this influence we must await the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> or canonical communities established in the eleventh century for the effective counteracting of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a>.

<p>The Council of Lateran (1059) and another council held at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> four years later approved for the members of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> the strict community life of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> Age, such as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> had caused to be practised in his episcopal house and had taught in his two sermons heretofore cited. The first communities of canons adopted these sermons as their basis of organization. This reform movement spread rapidly throughout Latin <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and brought about the foundation of the regular chapters so numerous and prosperous during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Monasteries of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> or of canonesses were formed on the same plan, but not according to the rules laid down in the sermons "De vit&acirc; et moribus clericorum." The letter to virgins was adopted almost immediately and became the rule of the canons and canonesses; hence it was the religious code of the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>, of the houses of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a>, and of canonesses either gathered into congregations or isolated, of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Friars Preachers</a>, of the Trinitarians and of the Order of Mercy, both for the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of captives, of hospitaller communities, both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, dedicated to the care of the sick in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and of some <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military orders</a>.
