<h1>Rule of St. Benedict</h1>  

<p><a href="../images/02436aax.jpg"><img alt="Image" align=right src="../images/02436aat.jpg"></a>

<p>This work holds the first place among monastic legislative codes, and was by far the most important factor in the organization and spread of monasticism in the West. For its general character and also its illustration of St. Benedict's own life, see the article <a href="../cathen/02467b.htm">SAINT BENEDICT</a>. Here, however, it is treated in more detail, under the following heads: <blockquote><p><a href="../cathen/02436a.htm#I">I. The Text of the Rule;</a> <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm#II"><br>II. Analysis of the Rule;</a> <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm#III"><br>III. Practical Working of the Rule.</a></p></blockquote>

<h2 id="i">The text of the rule</h2>

<p>The exact time and place at which St. Benedict wrote his Rule are not known, nor can it be determined whether the Rule, as we now possess it, was composed as a single whole or whether it gradually took shape in response to the needs of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. Somewhere about 530 however, may be taken as a likely date, and <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> as a more probable place than <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a>, for the Rule certainly reflects St. Benedict's matured monastic and spiritual wisdom. The earliest chronicler says that when <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> was destroyed by the Lombards in 581, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> fled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, carrying with them, among other treasures, a copy of the Rule "which the holy Father had composed"; and in the middle of the eighth century there was in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> a copy believed to be St. Benedict's autograph. It has been assumed by many scholars that this was the copy brought from <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>; but though this is likely enough, it is not a <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>. Be that as it may, this <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the Rule was presented by Pope Zachary to <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> in the middle of the eighth century, a short time after the restoration of that <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> found it there when he visited <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> towards the end of the century, and at his request a most careful transcript of it was made for him, as an exemplar of the text to be disseminated throughout the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of his empire. Several copies of the Rule were made from it, one of which survives to this day; for there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the present Codex 914 of the St. Gall Library was copied directly from <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> copy for the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">Abbey</a> of <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a>. An exact diplomatic reprint (not in facsimile) of this codex was published at <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> in 1900, so that the text of this <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, certainly the best individual text of the Rule in existence, can be studied without difficulty. Various other <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> go back to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, or to its original at <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, which was destroyed by fire in 896, and thus the text of the so-called autograph may be restored by approved critical methods with quite unusual <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, and could we be certain that it really was the autograph, there would be no more to say.

<p>But as already pointed out, it is not quite certain that it was St. Benedict's autograph, and the case is complicated by the circumstance that there is in the field another type of text, represented by the oldest known <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, the Oxford Hatton <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> 42, and by other very early authorities, which certainly was the text most widely diffused in the seventh and eighth centuries. Whether this text was St. Benedict's first recension and the "autograph" his later revision, or whether the former is but a corrupted form of the latter, is a question which is still under debate, though the majority of critics lean towards the second alternative. In either case, however, the text of the "autograph" is the one to be adopted. The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, from the tenth century onwards, and the ordinary printed editions, give mixed texts, made up out of the two earliest types. Thus the text in current use is critically a bad one, but very few of the readings make any substantial difference.

<p>The Rule was written in the <em>Lingua Vulgaris</em> or Low Latin vernacular of the time, and contains much syntax and orthography not in conformance with the classical models. There is as yet no edition of the Rule that satisfies the requirements of modern criticism, though one is in process of preparation for the <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> "Corpus" of Latin Ecclesiastical writers. A sufficiently good manual edition was published by Dom Edmund Schmidt. of Metten, at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> in 1892, presenting in substance the text of St. Gall <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, with the Low Latin element eliminated.

<p>The number of commentators on the rule is legion. <a href="../cathen/03189a.htm">Calmet</a> gives a list of over a hundred and thirty such writers, and <a href="../cathen/14463c.htm">Ziegelbauer</a> gives a similar list. The earliest commentary, in point of date, is that which has been variously ascribed to Paul Warnefrid (a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> about 780-799), Hildemar, Ruthard of Hirsau, and others. Hildemar, a Gallic <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, brought to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> by Angelbert, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, reformed the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06019a.htm">Sts. Faustinus and Jovita</a> at <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a> and died in 840. Mart&eacute;ne, who considered this commentary to be the best ever produced, maintained that Hildemar was its real author, but modern critics attribute it to Paul Warnefrid. Amongst other commentators the following deserve mention: <a href="../cathen/07351a.htm">St. Hildegard</a> (d. 1178), the foundress and first <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Mount <a href="../cathen/13229a.htm">St. Rupert</a>, near Bingen on the Rhine, who held that St. Benedict's prohibition of flesh-meat did not include that of birds; Bernard, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, formerly of L&eacute;rins and afterwards a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> (d. 1282); Turrecremata (Torquemada) a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> (1468); <a href="../cathen/15062a.htm">Trithemius</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Sponheim (1516); Perez, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a> and Superior-General of the congregation of Valladolid; Haeften, Prior of Afflighem (1648); Stengel, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Anhausen (1663); M&eacute;ge (1691) and Mart&eacute;ne (1739) <a href="../cathen/10069b.htm">Maurists</a>; <a href="../cathen/03189a.htm">Calmet</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Senones (1757); and <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> (1707), who discusses at length several portions of the Rule in his Prefaces to the different volumes of the "Acta Sanctorum O.S.B."



<p>It is impossible to gauge the comparative value of these and other commentaries, because the different authors treat the Rule from different points of view. That of <a href="../cathen/03189a.htm">Calmet</a> is perhaps the most literal and exhaustive on many important points; those of Mart&eacute;ne and Haeften are mines of information regarding monastic tradition: Perez and M&eacute;ge are practical and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, though the latter has been considered lax in many of the views maintained; that of Turrecremata is useful as treating the Rule from the standpoint of <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>; and others give mystical interpretations of its contents. It may be pointed out that in studying the Rule as a practical code of monastic legislation, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to facilitate uniformity of observance, each congregation of the order has its own constitutions, approved by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, by which are regulated many of the matters of detail not touched upon by the Rule itself.

<p>Before proceeding to analyze St. Benedict's Rule and to discuss its leading characteristics, something must be said about the monasticism that preceded his times, and out of which his system grew, in order that some <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> may be gained as to how much of the Rule was borrowed from his precursors and how much was due to his own initiative. Such considerations are important because there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whatever that the introduction and propagation of St. Benedict's Rule was the turning-point which changed the whole trend of monasticism in the West.

<p>The earliest forms of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> monachism were characterized by their extreme austerity and by their more or less <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">eremetical</a> nature. In <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the followers of St. Anthony were purely <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">eremetical</a>, whilst those who followed the Rule of <a href="../cathen/11381a.htm">St. Pachomius</a>, though they more nearly approached the cenobitical ideal, were yet without that element of stability insisted upon by St. Benedict, viz: the "common life" and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> spirit. Under the Antonian system the austerities of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were left entirely to their own discretion; under the Pachomian, though there was an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> rule of limited severity, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were free to add to it what other ascetical practices they chose. And in both, the prevailing <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was that they were spiritual athletes, and as such they rivaled each other in austerity. Syrian and strictly Oriental monasticism need not be considered here, as it had no direct influence on that of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. When <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> (fourth century) organized Greek monasticism, he set himself against the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">eremetical</a> life and insisted upon a community life, with meals, work, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, all in common. With him the practice of austerity, unlike that of the Egyptians, was to be subject to control of the superior, for he considered that to wear out the body by austerities so as to make it unfit for work, was a misconception of the Scriptural precept of penance and <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>. His <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the monastic life was the result of the contact of primitive <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, as existing in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and the East, with <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> culture and modes of thought.

<p>Monasticism came into Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, as also in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, it was chiefly Antonian in character, though both the rules of St. Basil and <a href="../cathen/11381a.htm">St. Pachomius</a> were translated into Latin and doubtless made their influence felt. As far as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, each <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> had practically its own rule, and we have examples of this irresponsible form of monastic life in the community St. Benedict was called from his cave to govern, and in the <em>Gyrovagi</em> and <em>Sarabitae</em> whom he mentions in terms of condemnation in the first chapter of his Rule. A <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that the pervading spirit of Italian monachism was <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> lies in the fact that when St. Benedict determined to forsake the world and become a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, he adopted, almost as a matter of course, the life of a solitary in a cave. His familiarity with the rules and other documents bearing upon the life of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> is shown by his legislating for the daily reading of the "Conferences" of Cassian, and by his recommendation (c. 73) of the "Institutes" and "Lives" of the Fathers and the <a href="../cathen/02322a.htm">Rule of St. Basil</a>.

<p>When, therefore, St. Benedict came to write his own Rule for the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> he had founded, he embodied in it the result of his own mature experience and observation. He had himself lived the life of a solitary after the most extreme <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> pattern, and in his first communities he had no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> thoroughly tested the prevailing type of monastic rule. Being fully cognizant, therefore, of the unsuitability of much in the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> systems to the times and circumstances in which he lived, he now struck out on a new line, and instead of attempting to revivify the old forms of asceticism, he consolidated the cenobitical life, emphasized the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> spirit, and discouraged all private venture in austerities. His Rule thus consists of a carefully considered combination of old and new <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>; rivalry in austerity was eliminated, and there was to be henceforth a sinking of the individual in the community. In adapting a system essentially Eastern, to Western conditions, St. Benedict gave it coherence, stability, and organization, and the verdict of history is unanimous in applauding the results of such adaptation.

<h2 id="ii">Analysis of the rule</h2>

<p>Of the seventy-three chapters comprising the Rule, nine treat of the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, thirteen regulate the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, twenty-nine are concerned with <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> and the penal code, ten refer to the internal administration of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and the remaining twelve consist of miscellaneous regulations.

<p>The Rule opens with a prologue or hortatory preface, in which St. Benedict sets forth the main principles of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, viz.: the renunciation of one's own will and the taking up of arms under the banner of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. He proposes to establish a "school" in which the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">science of salvation</a> shall be taught, so that by persevering in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> till death his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> may "deserve to become partakers of <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Christ's kingdom</a>".

<ul><li>In Chapter 1 are defined the four principle kinds of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>: (1) Cenobites, those living in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> under an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>; (2) <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">Anchorites</a>, or <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a>, living a solitary life after long probation in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>; (3) <a href="../cathen/13468b.htm">Sarabites</a>, living by twos and threes together, without any fixed rule or lawfully constituted superior; and (4) Gyrovagi, a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> vagrants, whose lives spent in wandering from one <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to another, only served to bring discredit on the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> profession. It is for the first of these classes, as the most stable kind, that the Rule is written.
<li>Chapter 2 describes the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> qualifications of an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and forbids him to make distinction of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> except for particular merit, warning him at the same time that he will be answerable for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> committed to his care.
<li>Chapter 3 ordains the calling of the brethren to council upon all affairs of importance to the community. <li>Chapter 4 summarizes the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life under seventy-two <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>, which are called "instruments of good works" and are mainly <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptural</a> either in letter or in spirit. <li>Chapter 5 prescribes prompt, cheerful, and absolute obedience to the superior in all things lawful, which obedience is called the first degree of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. <li>Chapter 6 deals with <a href="../cathen/13790a.htm">silence</a>, recommending moderation in the use of speech, but by no means prohibiting profitable or <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> conversation. <li>Chapter 7 treats of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is divided into twelve degrees or steps in the ladder that leads to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. They are: (1) fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; (2) repression of self-will; (3) submission of the will to superiors; (4) obedience in hard and difficult matters; (5) confession of faults; (6) acknowledgment of one's own worthlessness; (7) preference of others to self; (8) avoidance of singularity; (9) speaking only in due season; (10) stifling of unseemly laughter; (11) repression of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; (12) exterior <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>.
<li>Chapters 9-19 are occupied with the regulation of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, the <em>opus Dei</em> to which "nothing is to be preferred", or <a href="../cathen/07500b.htm">Canonical Hours</a>, seven of the day and one of the night. Detailed arrangements are made as to the number of Psalms, etc., to be recited in winter and summer, on Sundays, weekdays, Holy Days, and at other times. <li>Chapter 19 emphasizes the reverence due to the <a href="../cathen/12396a.htm">presence of God</a>. <li>Chapter 20 directs that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in common be short. <li>Chapter 21 provides for the appointment of <a href="../cathen/04659a.htm">deans</a> over every ten <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and prescribes the manner in which they are to be chosen. <li>Chapter 22 regulates all matters relating to the dormitory, as, for example, that each <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> is to have a separate bed and is to sleep in his habit, so as to be ready to rise without delay, and that a light shall burn in the dormitory throughout the night. <li>Chapter 23-30 deal with offences against the Rule and a graduated scale of penalties is provided: first, private admonition; next, public reproof; then separation from the brethren at meals and elsewhere; then scourging; and finally expulsion; though this last is not to be resorted to until every effort to reclaim the offender has failed. And even in this last case, the outcast must be received again, should he so desire, but after the third expulsion all return is finally barred. <li>Chapter 31 and 32 order the appointment of a cellarer and other officials, to take charge of the various goods of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, which are to be treated with as much care as the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">vessels of the altar</a>. <li>Chapter 33 forbids the private possession of anything without the leave of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, who is, however, bound to supply all necessaries. <li>Chapter 34 prescribes a just distribution of such things. <li>Chapter 35 arranges for the service in the kitchen by all <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in turn. <li>Chapter 36 and 37 order due care for the sick, the old, and the young. They are to have certain <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> from the strict Rule, chiefly in the matter of food. <li>Chapter 38 prescribes reading aloud during meals, which <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> is to be performed by such of the brethren, week by week, as can do so with edification to the rest. Signs are to be used for whatever may be wanted at meals, so that no voice shall interrupt that of the reader. The reader is to have his meal with the servers after the rest have finished, but he is allowed a little food beforehand in order to lessen the fatigue of reading. <li>Chapter 39 and 40 regulate the quantity and quality of the food. Two meals a day are allowed and two dishes of cooked food at each. A pound of bread also and a hemina (probably about half a pint) of wine for each <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. Flesh-meat is prohibited except for the sick and the weak, and it is always within the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot's</a> power to increase the daily allowance when he sees fit. <li>Chapter 41 prescribes the hours of the meals, which are to vary according to the time of year. <li>Chapter 42 enjoins the reading of the "Conferences" of Cassian or some other edifying book in the evening before <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Compline</a> and orders that after <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Compline</a> the strictest <a href="../cathen/13790a.htm">silence</a> shall be observed until the following morning.
<li>Chapters 43-46 relate to minor faults, such as coming late to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> or meals, and impose various penalties for such transgressions. <li>Chapter 47 enjoins on the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of calling the brethren to the "world of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" in choir, and of appointing those who are to <a href="../cathen/09304a.htm">chant</a> or read. <li>Chapter 48 emphasizes the importance of manual labour and arranges <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> to be devoted to it daily. This varies according to the season, but is apparently never less than about five hours a day. The times at which the lesser of the "day-hours" (Prime, <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">Terce</a>, <a href="../cathen/13747c.htm">Sext</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11097a.htm">None</a>) are to be recited control the hours of labour somewhat, and the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> is instructed not only to see that all work, but also that the employments of each are suited to their respective capacities. <li>Chapter 49 treats of the observance of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, and recommends some <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> self-denial for that season, with the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot's</a> sanction. <li>Chapters 50 and 51 contain rules for <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who are working in the fields or traveling. They are directed to join in spirit, as far as possible, with their brethren in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at the regular hours of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. <li>Chapter 52 commands that the <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratory</a> be used for purposes of devotion only. <li>Chapter 53 is concerned with the treatment of guests, who are to be received "as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself". This <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/07475c.htm">hospitality</a> is a feature which has in all ages been characteristic of the order. The guests are to be met with due courtesy by the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> or his deputy, and during their stay they are to be under the special protection of a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> appointed for the purpose, but they are not to associate with the rest of the community except by special permission. <li>Chapter 54 forbids the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to receive letters or gifts without the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot's</a> leave. <li>Chapter 55 regulates the clothing of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. It is to be sufficient in both quantity and quality and to be suited to the climate and locality, according to the discretion of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, but at the same time it must be as plain and cheap as is consistent with due economy. Each <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> is to have a change of garments, to allow for washing, and when traveling shall be supplied with clothes of rather better quality. The old habits are to be put aside for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>.
<li>Chapter 56 directs that the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> shall take his meals with the guests. <li>Chapter 57 enjoins <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> on the craftsmen of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and if their work is for sale, it shall be rather below than above the current trade price. <li>Chapter 58 lays down rules for the admission of new members, which is not to be made too easy. These matters have since been regulated by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but in the main St. Benedict's outline is adhered to. The <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulant</a> first spends a short time as a guest; then he is admitted to the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, where under the care of a novice-master, his <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">vocation</a> is severely tested; during this time he is always free to depart. If after twelve month' probation, he still persevere, he may be admitted to the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of Stability, <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">Conversion of Life</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">Obedience</a>, by which he binds himself for life to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of his profession. <li>Chapter 59 allows the admission of boys to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> under certain conditions. <li>Chapter 60 regulates the position of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who may desire to join the community. They are charged with setting an example of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> to all, and can only exercise their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions by permission of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. <li>Chapter 61 provides for the reception of strange <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> as guests, and for their admission if desirous of joining the community. <li>Chapter 62 lays down that precedence in the community shall be determined by the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of admission, merit of life, or the appointment of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. <li>Chapter 64 orders that the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> be elected by his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and that he be chosen for his charity, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and discretion. <li>Chapter 65 allows the appointment of a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a>, if need be, but warns such a one that he is to be entirely subject to the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and may be admonished, <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, or expelled for misconduct. <li>Chapter 66 provides for the appointment of a <a href="../cathen/12284b.htm">porter</a>, and recommends that each <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> should be, if possible, self-contained, so as to avoid the need of intercourse with the outer world. <li>Chapter 67 gives instruction as to the behavior of a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> who is sent on a journey. <li>Chapter 68 orders that all shall cheerfully attempt to do whatever is commanded them, however hard it may seem. <li>Chapter 69 forbids the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to defend one another. <li>Chapter 70 prohibits them from striking one another. <li>Chapter 71 encourages the brethren to be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> not only to the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and his officials, but also to one another. <li>Chapter 72 is a brief exhortation to <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and fraternal charity <li>Chapter 73 is an epilogue declaring that this Rule is not offered as an ideal of perfection, but merely as a means towards godliness and is intended chiefly for beginners in the spiritual life.</ul>
<h3>Characteristics of the Rule</h3>

<p>In considering the leading characteristics of this Holy Rule, the first that must strike the reader is its wonderful discretion and moderation, its extreme reasonableness, and its keen insight into the capabilities as well as the weaknesses of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Here are no excesses, no extraordinary asceticism, no narrow-mindedness, but rather a series of sober regulations based on sound common-sense. We see these qualities displayed in the deliberate elimination of austerities and in the concessions made with regard to what the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> would have looked upon as luxuries. A few comparisons between the customs of these latter and the prescriptions of St. Benedict's Rule will serve to bring out more clearly the extent of his changes in this direction.

<p>With regard to food, the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> ascetics reduced it to a minimum, many of them eating only twice or thrice a week, whilst Cassian describes a meal consisting of parched vetches with salt and oil, three olives, two prunes, and a fig, as a "sumptuous repast" (Coll. vii, 1). St. Benedict, on the other hand, though he restricts the use of flesh-meat to the sick, orders a pound of bread daily and two dishes of cooked food at each meal, of which there were two in summer and one in winter. And he concedes also an allowance of wine, though admitting that it should not properly be the drink of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> (Chapter 40). As to clothing, St. Benedict's provision that habits were to fit, to be sufficiently warm, and not too old, was in great contrast to the poverty of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, whose clothes, Abbot Pambo laid down, should be so poor that if left on the road no one would be tempted to take them (Apophthegmata, in P.G. LXV, 369). In the matter of sleep, whereas the solitaries of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> regarded diminution as one of their most valued forms of austerity, St. Benedict ordered from six to eight hours of unbroken sleep a day, with the addition of a siesta in summer. The <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, moreover, often slept on the bare ground, with stones or mats for pillows, and often merely sitting or merely reclining, as directed in the Pachomian Rule, whilst Abbot John was unable to mention without shame the finding of a blanket in a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit's</a> cell (Cassian, Coll. xix, 6). St. Benedict, however, allowed not only a blanket but also a coverlet, a mattress, and a pillow to each <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. This comparative liberality with regard to the necessaries of life, though plain and meagre perhaps, if tested by modern notions of comfort, was far greater than amongst the Italian poor of the sixth century or even amongst many of the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> peasantry at the present day. St. Benedict's aim seems to have been to keep the bodies of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in a healthy condition by means of proper clothing, sufficient food, and ample sleep, so that they might thereby be more fit for the due performance of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> and be freed from all that distracting rivalry in asceticism which has already been mentioned. There was, however, no desire to lower the ideal or to minimize the self-sacrifice that the adoption of the monastic life entailed, but rather the intention of bringing it into line with the altered circumstances of Western environment, which necessarily differed much from those of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and the East. The wisdom and skill with which he did this is evident in every page of the Rule, so much so that <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> was able to call it "an epitome of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, a learned and mysterious abridgement of all the doctrines of the Gospel, all the institutions of the Fathers, and all the Counsels of Perfection".

<p>St. Benedict perceived the necessity for a permanent and uniform rule of government in place of the arbitrary and variable choice of models furnished by the lives and maxims of the Fathers of the Desert. And so we have the characteristic of collectivism, exhibited in his insistence on the common life, as opposed to the <a href="../cathen/07761a.htm">individualism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. One of the objects he had in view in writing his Rule was the extirpation of the <a href="../cathen/13468b.htm">Sarabites</a> and Gyrovagi, whom he so strongly condemns in his first chapter and of whose <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> lives he had probably had painful experience during his early days at <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a>. To further this aim he introduced the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of Stability, which becomes the guarantee of success and permanence. It is only another example of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that pervaded the entire Rule, by means of which the members of the community are bound together by a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> tie, and each takes upon himself the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of persevering in his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> until death, unless sent elsewhere by his superiors. It secures to the community as a whole, and to every member of it individually, a share in all the fruits that may arise from the labours of each <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, and it gives to each of them that strength and vitality which necessarily result from being one of a united <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, all bound in a similar way and all pursuing the same end. Thus, whatever the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> does, he does it not as an independent individual but as part of a larger organization, and the community itself thus becomes one united whole rather than a mere agglomeration of independent members. The <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of Conversion of Life indicates the personal striving after perfection that must be the aim of every <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. All the legislation of the Rule, the constant repression of self, the conforming of one's every action to a definite standard, and the continuance of this form of life to the end of one's days, is directed towards "putting off the old man and putting on the new", and thereby accomplishing the <em>conversio morum</em> which is inseparable from a life-long perseverance in the maxims of the Rule. The practice of obedience is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> feature in St. Benedict's <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, if not indeed its very essence. Not only is a special chapter of the Rule devoted to it, but it is repeatedly referred to as a guiding principle in the life of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>; so essentials it that it is the subject of a special <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> in every religious institute, <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> or otherwise. In St. Benedict's eyes it is one of the positive works to which the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> binds himself, for he calls it <em>labor obedientiae</em> (Prologue). It is to be cheerful, unquestioning, and prompt; to the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> chiefly, who is to be obeyed as holding the place of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and also to all the brethren according to the dictates of fraternal charity, as being "the path that leads to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (Chapter 71). It is likewise extended to hard and even impossible things, the latter being at least attempted in all <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. In connexion with the question of obedience there is the further question as to the system of government embodied in the Rule. The life of the community centres round the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> as the father of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Much latitude with regard to details is left to "discretion and judgement", but this power, so far from being absolute or unlimited, is safeguarded by the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> laid upon him of consulting the brethren - either the seniors only or else the entire community - upon all matters affecting their welfare. And on the other hand, wherever there seems to be a certain amount of liberty left to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> themselves, this, in turn, is protected against indiscretion by the repeated insistence on the necessity for the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot's</a> sanction and approval. The <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of Poverty and Chastity, though not explicitly mentioned by St. Benedict, as in the rules of other orders, are yet implied so clearly as to form an indisputable and essential part of the life for which he legislates. Thus by means of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and the practice of the various virtues <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to their proper observance, it will be seen that St. Benedict's Rule contains not merely a series of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> regulating the external details of monastic life, but also all the principles of perfection according to the Evangelical Counsels.

<p>With regard to the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> or binding power of the Rule, we must distinguish between the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> or <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> and the counsels. By the former would be meant those <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which either command or prohibit in an absolute manner, and by the latter those that are merely recommendations. It is generally held by commentators that the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the Rule bind only under the penalty of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the counsels not even under that. Really grave transgressions against the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, on the other hand, would fall under the category of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. It must be remembered, however, that in all these matters the principles of <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, canon law, the decisions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the regulations of the Constitutions of the different congregations must be taken into consideration in judging of any particular case.

<h2 id="iii">Practical working of the rule</h2>

<p>No higher testimony as to the inherent excellencies of the Rule can be adduced than the results it has achieved in Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and elsewhere; and no more striking quality is exhibited by it than by its adaptability to the ever-changing requirements of time and place since St. Benedict's days. Its enduring character is the highest testimony to its wisdom. For fourteen centuries it has been the guiding light of a numerous <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of religious, men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and it is a living code at the present day, just as it was a thousand years ago. Though modified and adapted, from time to time, to suit the peculiar necessities and conditions of various ages and countries, by reason of its wonderful elasticity its principles still remain the same, and it has formed the fundamental basis of a great variety of other religious bodies. It has merited the encomiums of councils, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, and commentators, and its vitality is as vigorous at the present time as it was in the ages of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Though it was no part of St. Benedict's design that his spiritual descendants should make a figure in the world as authors or statesmen, as preservers of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> literature, as pioneers of civilization, as revivers of agriculture, or as builders of castles and <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>, yet circumstances brought them into all these spheres. His sole <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was the moral and spiritual training of his disciples, and yet in carrying this out he made the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of useful workers, a real refuge for <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, and a solid bulwark of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (Dudden, Gregory the Great, II, ix). The Rule, instead of restricting the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> to one particular form of work, makes it possible for him to do almost any kind of work, and that in a manner spiritualized and elevated above the labour of merely secular craftsmen. In this lies one of the secrets of its success.

<p>The results of the fulfilment of the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the Rule are abundantly apparent in history. That of manual labour, for instance, which St. Benedict laid down as absolutely essential for his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, produced many of the <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> triumphs which are the glory of the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a>. Many <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> (especially in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>), <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, and churches, scattered up and down the countries of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, were the work of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> builders and architects. The cultivation of the soil, encouraged by St. Benedict, was another form of labour to which his followers gave themselves without reserve and with conspicuous success, do that many regions have owed much of their agricultural prosperity to the skillful husbandry of the sons of St. Benedict. The hours ordered by the Rule to be devoted daily to systematic reading and study, have given to the world many of the foremost scholars and writers, so that the term "Benedictine erudition" has been for long centuries a byword indicative of the learning and laborious research fostered in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. The regulations regarding the reception and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of children, moreover, were the germ from which sprang up a great number of famous <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> which flourished in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>.

<p>It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that as communities became rich and consequently less dependent upon their own labours for support, the primitive fervour for the Rule diminished, and for this reason charges of corruption and absolute departure from monastic ideals have been made against <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. But, although it is impossible to deny that the many reforms that were initiated seem to give colour to this view, it cannot be admitted that the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Institute, as a whole, ever became really degenerate or fell away seriously from the ideal established by its legislator. Individual failures there certainly were, as well as mitigations of rule, from time to time, but the loss of fervour in one particular <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> no more compromises all the other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the same country than the faults of one individual <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> reflect necessarily upon the rest of the community to which he belongs. So, whilst admitting that the rigour of the Rule has varied at different times and in different places, we must, on the other hand, remember that modern historical research has entirely exonerated the monastic body as a whole from the charge of a general departure from the principles of the Rule and a widespread corruption of either ideal or practice. Circumstances have often rendered mitigations <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> but they have always been introduced as such and not as new or better interpretations of the Rule itself. The fact that the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> still glory in their Rule, guard it with jealousy, and point to it as the exemplar according to which they are endeavouring to model their lives, is in itself the strongest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that they are still imbued with its spirit, though recognizing its latitude of application and its adaptability to various conditions.
