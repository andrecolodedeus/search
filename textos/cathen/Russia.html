<h1>Russia</h1>  

<h2>Geography</h2>

<p>Russia (<em>Rossiiskaia Imperiia; Russkoe Gosudarstvo</em>) comprises the greater part of Eastern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and a third of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>; its area is one-sixth of the land surface of the globe. In the reign of Alexander II the total area of the empire was 8,689,945 sq. miles, of which only 2,156,000 were in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The greatest length of Russia from east to west is 6666 miles, and its greatest breadth is 2666 miles; it lies between 35&ordm; 45' and 79&ordm; N. lat., and 17&ordm; 40' and 191&ordm; E. long. (i.e., 169 W. long.). The boundaries of Russia are: on the north, the Arctic Ocean; on the west, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, the Baltic Sea, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a>, and Rumania; on the south, the Black Sea, <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkey</a>, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, the Caspian Sea; Afghanistan, and <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>; on the east, the Pacific Ocean. Russia forms a vast, compact territory, the area of its islands being only 107,262 sq. miles, which was greatly reduced by the cession of the southern part of Sakhalin to <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. Geographers usually divide Russia into <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> and <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> Russia, regarding the natural boundary to be the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, the Don, and the Volga; this division is based neither on natural nor on political grounds. The Ural Mountains form a chain of wooded highlands, which may be compared to the central axis of the empire rather than to a dividing barrier; moreover there is no natural boundary line between the southern extremity of these mountains and the Caspian Sea. The division between <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> and <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> Russia can best be established ethnologically, and this method is frequently used in Russian geographies.
<h2>Seas</h2>

<p>The coasts of Russia are washed by many seas; the Arctic Ocean, the White Sea, the Bay of Tcheskaya, the Bay of Kara, the Gulf of Obi, the Baltic Sea, the Gulfs of Bothnia, <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a>, and Riga, the Black Sea, the Sea of Azof, the Caspian Sea, the Pacific Ocean, Behring Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Sea of <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. But Russia is not destined to become a great maritime power, because for the most part the seas of Russia are in regions where navigation is impossible in winter; for periods of six months in the Arctic Ocean, and from fifteen days to one month at some points in the Black Sea. And the future of Russia as a maritime power is moreover obstructed by political difficulties; the way from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean is closed by the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles; the way from the Baltic to the Atlantic is closed by Sweden, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. The Arctic Ocean washes the extreme northern coasts of Russia, sterile, uninhabited regions, over which there hangs a winter of nine months, paralyzing the activities of life. The ice, whether fixed or floating, blocks the way of ships; these ply however in the White Sea, which is free of ice for three months of the year, and the waters of which form the Gulfs of Mezen, the Dwina, Onega, and Kandalak, the latter being the most frequented. There are but few islands in this immense extent of ice; the more important ones are the islands of Kolguet, Vaigatch, Nova Zembla, New Siberia, and the islands of Solovka, on one of which is a famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> founded in the fifteenth century by St. Sabbatius and the Blessed Germanus. Among the most important peninsulas may be cited that of Kola or Russian Lapland. Russia shares the possession of the Baltic Sea with Sweden, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, and its waters have been the highway of Russian commerce since the time of Peter the Great, although their shores are rugged and reefs numerous. The Gulfs of Bothnia, <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a> and Riga are frozen for several months of the year, while the Gulf of Livadia is frozen for six weeks, although it sometimes remains free of ice through the whole year. Notwithstanding these natural obstacles, Russian commerce has been developed on the Baltic, the shortest route for the exportation of Russian products to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> countries and America. The Baltic Sea is studded with islands, of which the following belong to Russia: the numerous Aland group, eighty of which are inhabited; the Islands of Dago, Oesel, Mohn, Wornes, and Kotlin; on the last is built the formidable fortress of Kronstadt.
<h2>Climate</h2>

<p>In <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia the climate is severe, both in winter and summer, the rains are scanty, and the temperature is not as mild as in Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The coasts of the Baltic and the shores of the Vistula have a climate similar to that of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia presents graduated variations of climate between 40&ordm; and 70&ordm; N. lat., and also from east to west. At Nova Zembla the lowest winter temperature is 16&ordm; F., while at the south of the Crimea it rises to 56.3&ordm; in summer. The isothermal lines of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia are not coincident with the parallels of latitude, but diverge towards the southeast. There are places situated on the same parallel presenting considerable differences in mean temperature, e.g. Libau, 49.1&ordm;; <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, 39.2&ordm;; Kazan, 37.4&ordm;; Yekaterinburg, 32.9&ordm;. In the valley of the Rion in the Caucasus, cotton and sugar-cane are grown, while the tundras of the Kola Peninsula are sparsely covered with moss. In Western Russia, the cold of winter is never greater than 31&ordm; below zero, while the heat of summer is never in excess of 86&ordm;; but in Eastern Russia the thermometer falls to 40&ordm; below zero in winter, and rises to 109&ordm; in summer. <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia may be divided into four climatic zones: the cold zone, which includes the coasts of the Arctic Ocean and their adjacent islands, and extends beyond the Arctic Circle; its winter lasts nine months, and its summer three; the cold-temperate zone, from the Arctic Circle to 61&ordm; N. lat.; its winter Lasts six months, and each of the other seasons two months; the temperate zone, extending from 61&ordm; to 48&ordm; N. lat.; each season lasts three months, the winter being longer towards the north, and summer longer towards the south; the warm zone, between 48&ordm; N. lat. and the southern frontier of Russia; the summer lasts six months, and the other three seasons two months each. <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia is not unhealthy, although in the cold zone scurvy is frequent, and near the Gulf of Finland ailments of the throat and the respiratory organs; <em>plica polonica</em> infects the marshy regions of <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a> and Russian <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>; and there is the so-called Crimean fever in the neighbourhood of the Sivash and in a region on the coast of the Black Sea.



<p>The climate of the Caucasus is not of a uniform character; it belongs in the north to the cold-temperate zone, and in Transcaucasia to the warm zone. In the north, summer lasts six months, and the other seasons two months each. In Transcaucasia the summer lasts nine months, and the other three months of the year are like spring. Nevertheless the irregularity of the mountain system of the Caucasus produces differences of temperature in places separated by short distances. On the coast of the Black Sea between Batum and Sukhum, the temperature seldom falls below 32&ordm;; in January the temperature rises as high as 43&ordm;. Western Transcaucasia receives warm and humid winds, while the eastern part is exposed to dry winds from the north-east.

<p>The part of <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a> that borders on the Arctic Ocean lies entirely within the cold zone; the winter lasts nine months, and the summer is like the beginning of spring in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia. The portion of <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a> between the Arctic Circle and 60&ordm; N. lat. has a winter that lasts six months; the region below the parallel of 60&ordm; N. lat. has a winter a little longer than the summer. In proportion to the distance from the Ural Mountains the climate of Western Siberia experiences greater extremes of temperature, the winter and the heat of summer becoming more severe; and the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of Eastern Siberia in relation to the Pacific Ocean. The greatest variations of temperature in Eastern Siberia are observed at Irkutsk, Yakutsk, and Verkhoyansk, where the thermometer registers at times 59.6&ordm; below zero in winter, and 49.46&ordm; in summer. In midwinter the northern extremity of <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a> resembles the polar regions; during several days the sun does not rise, and the vast plain of snow is lit up by the Aurora Borealis, while at times the region of the <em>tundras</em> is swept by violent snowstorms. The climate of <a href="../cathen/15095a.htm">Turkestan</a> is similar to Siberia. Those regions are far from the sea, and have cold winters and very warm summers, a sky that is always clear, a dry atmosphere, and strong northerly and north-easterly winds. The north winds develop violent snowstorms. The summer is unbearable; in the shade, the thermometer rises to 104&ordm;, and even to 117.5&ordm;, while the ground becomes heated to 158&ordm;.

<p>The mean yearly rainfall is estimated at from 8 to 24 inches. In general, those parts of Russia that are exposed to the North, and are covered with snow during the winter, abound in forests that preserve the humidity, in which they have an advantage over the southern part of the country. In the former, the rains are not violent, but are lasting, and moisten the earth to a considerable depth; in the South they are resolved into severe tempests, which pour down great quantities of water that are dispersed in torrents and rivers, and do not sink deep into the ground. The greatest rainfall of Russia is around the Baltic Sea (20 to 28 inches); and the least is in the Caucasus (4 to 8 inches). The advantages of the western over the eastern part of Russia are due to its greater proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, the vapours of which are carried over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> into Russia. The mean rainfall of Western Russia is calculated at 18.3 inches; that of the north-east, 15 inches; that of the east, from 12 to 15 inches; and that of the south is still less. The months of greatest rainfall are June, July, and August. The yearly rainfall at St. Petersburg is 20 inches, there being rain on 150 days of the year. The number of days upon which rain falls diminishes considerably towards the East and South.
<h2>Mineral riches</h2>

<p>The mineral riches of Russia consist principally of salt, coal, and iron. Salt is found in the mineral state in the Governments of Orenburg, Astrakhan, Kharkoff, and Yekaterinoslaff; and as a sediment, deposited by salt waters, in the Government of Astrakhan, and in the Crimean lakes of Sakskoe, Sasyk, and Sivash. The river basin that most abounds in coal is that of the Donetz; it is 233 miles in length, and 100 in breadth, and produces every known species of fossil coal. This basin also furnishes great quantities of peat, naphtha, gold, silver, platinum, copper, tin, mercury, iron, emeralds, topazes, rubies, sapphires, amethysts, porphyry, marble, granite, graphite, asphalt, and phosphorus. The Central Ural Mountains yield malachite and jasper. There are abundant petroleum springs in the Caucasus Mountains, especially in the vicinity of Baku. In the Kolivan Mountains, which is a ramification of the Altai system, deposits of malachite are found.
<h2>Ethnography and statistics of population</h2>

<p>The ethnographical history of primitive Russia is obscure. There is record of the Anti, a people who in the fourth century inhabited the regions about the mouths of the Danube and Don, but their name is lost after that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. Constantine Porphyrogenitus and the Russian chroniclers refer to twelve tribes, collected under the general name of Russians; they are the Slovenes, Krivitches, Dregovitches, Drevilans, Polians, Duliebys, Buzhans, Tivercys, Ulitches, Radimitches, Viatics, and the Sieverians. The political cradle of Russia is the region of Kieff, where the Varangian princes formed the first Russian state. The invasions of the Tatars exercised a great influence upon the Russians; but it is a mistake to say that the Russians disappeared entirely before the Tatars and that, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the regions evacuated by the Tatars were peopled by Little Russians from Galicia. The population of Russia has steadily increased in numbers during the last two centuries, its rapid development being partly due to the birth-rate, and partly to the conquest of vast foreign territories. In 1724 Russia had a population of 14,000,000, which had increased to 36,000,000 in 1793, to 69,000,000 in 1851, and to 128,967,694 in 1897. The census of 1897 was the first official census of Russia. Its data, however, are only relatively correct, partly on account of the great extension of the Russian Empire, partly on account of the continuous emigration within the frontiers of that country, partly because of the lack of information concerning some of the centres of population in <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a>, and partly because of the resistance of some tribes to submit to the control of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> civilization. In view of the enormous excess of births over deaths, the progressive increase of the population is calculated to be 2,000,000 each year. In 1904, basing the calculation on the statistics of births, the population of Russia was 146,000,000; in 1908, 154,000,000; and in 1910, 158,000,000. The greatest increase in the population is given by the region of New Russia, that of the Baltic, and the Province of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>. In general, the number of births in Russia is calculated at 48 per 1000, and that of the deaths at 34 per 1000. Compared with other <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> states, Russia is very thinly peopled, except in a few regions; for the whole empire, it is 17.325 per sq. mile; for <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia 65; for <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, 214; and for Siberia, 1.35. The government in which the population appears to be most dense is that of Piotrkow, where the corresponding figures are 295 inhabitants per sq. mile; after which follow in order the Governments of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> (187), Podolia (184.5), and Kieff (180). In the Government of Archangel, there are 2.25 inhabitants per sq. mile, and in Yakutsk .225.

<p>The great mass of the population consists of peasants; they form 84 per cent of the population of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia, a percentage greatly in excess of that of <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumania</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, nations that are essentially agricultural. The nobles and their servants constitute 1.5 per cent of the population; the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, 0.5 per cent; the citizens or merchants, 0.6 per cent; the burgesses (<em>mieshanstvo</em>), 10.6 per cent. The proportion of working men shows a notable increase: from 1885 to 1897 the increase in the mining centres was 91 per cent, and in the manufacturing centres 73 per cent; the population of the cities also is continually increasing. Some of these cities, as Kazan, Astrakhan, Tiflis, and Bakhtchisarai, are semi-Asiatic in character, as are also the cities of <a href="../cathen/15095a.htm">Turkestan</a>. The cities of ancient Livonia, e.g., Riga and Reval, have the appearance of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> German towns. The villages of Great Russia have a commercial character, and stretch along the principal roads and waterways. On the other hand the villages of Little Russia are agricultural in character. The White Russian villages are noticeable for the small number of houses they contain. With relation to sex, according to the statistics of 1905, the population of Russia has 103.2 <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> for each 100 men. In the villages, the corresponding proportion of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> is 106.1; in the cities, it is 85.9. In 13 out of 50 of the governments of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia, the number of men is greater than that of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; in 3 the numbers are equal, and in 34 the number of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> is in excess of that of the men; in 12 governments the proportion is 100 men to 110 <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.

<p>With regard to religion, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in various <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> is the religion of the great majority of the people. There are 123,000,000 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (84.3 per cent of the entire population). The majority are of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, which has 102,600,000 adherents (69.9 per cent of the population, the corresponding figures for <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia being 91,000,000 (75 per cent). Consequently among the Russians Orthodox and Russian are synonymous terms. Since the Ukase of 17 April, 1905, which proclaimed freedom of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, Russian <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> has lost 1,000,000 of followers, through conversions to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Russia number 13,000,000 (8.9 per cent); the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, 7,200,000 (4.9 per cent); other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>, 1,400,000 (1 per cent); <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, 15,900,000 (10 per cent); <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, 700,000 (0.4 per cent). <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Pagans</a>, to the number of 300,000, are to be found, not only in <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a>, but also in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia (Kalmucks and Samogitians). The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are chiefly in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, where, according to the census of 1897, they constituted 74.8 per cent of the population. On the other hand, one-half of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who are scattered over the earth are in Russia, the number of them in that country being estimated at from 6,000,000 to 7,000,000, all concentrated within the boundaries of fifteen governments.

<p>From the standpoint of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, Russia does not occupy even a secondary position in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia the percentage of those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to read and write is 22.9. The regions in which there are the least numbers of the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> are as follows: Esthonia (79 per cent); Livonia (77.7 per cent); Courland (70.9 per cent); the cities of St. Petersburg (55.1 per cent) and <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> (40.2 per cent), and <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> (41 per cent).

<p>Emigration, as a rule, takes place only within the boundaries of the empire. From the most remote times, the inhabitants of Novgorod founded colonies as far away as the shores of the White Sea and the Ural Mountains. Emigration to Siberia began in 1582; the first colonists of that country were the exiles, the Cossacks, fishermen, and prospectors in search of gold; and this emigration was considerably increased after the liberation of the serfs in 1861. In 1891 the Siberian Railway Company undertook the colonization of <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a>, and by opportune measures gave a great impulse to Siberian immigration. In 1889 the number of Russian emigrants to that region was between 25,000 and 40,000; in 1900 it had increased to 220,000. These emigrants, who came from Central Russia and from Little Russia, spread at first over Western Siberia, and then over Central Siberia; but later they went farther and farther towards the extreme east, a movement to which the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> put a stop, but which was again taken up with greater activity when that <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> ended. In 1906, 200,790 emigrants passed through Cheliabinsk to <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a>, and 400,000 in 1907. A part of the emigration is directed towards the southeast of <a href="../cathen/15095a.htm">Turkestan</a>. The first colonists arrived in the Province of Semiryetchensk in 1848, and in the Province of Sir-Daria in 1876. Emigration beyond the frontiers of Russia is very limited, amounting in numbers at the present time to from 75,000 to 100,000, who for the greater part pass through the ports of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a> and <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>. From 1891 to 1906, out of every 1000 Russian emigrants, 900 went to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, and the majority of the others to <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentine Republic</a>.

<p>The population of Russia is very much divided linguistically, it being calculated that a hundred languages are spoken within the empire, of which forty-two are in use in the city of Tiflis alone. Russian is the official language of eighty-nine governments and provinces, but it is the predominant language in only forty-one of them. Among the dialects, Great Russian is the one that is most extensively used. The tongues of the Mongolian tribes that are subject to Russia are little developed, and are generally without a literature. The population of Russia presents a great variety of races, united by a political rule, by the community of the Russian language, and to a great extent by the Orthodox religion; it is characterized also by a great preponderance of the rural over the urban population, and by the presence of a high percentage of peoples or tribes with little culture of their own, and little aptitude for the assimilation of the culture of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>.
<h2>Special ethnography</h2>

<p>Ethnographically the population of the Russian Empire is divided into two races, the Caucasian, which predominates, and the Mongolian. Of the total population 121,000,000, or 82.6 per cent, are Caucasians; while the Mongolian races in all Russia constitute 17 per cent of the whole population. Russians, properly so-called, constitute 87.7 per cent of the population in Western Siberia, 80 per cent in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia, 53.9 per cent in eastern Siberia, 8.9 per cent in central <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, 6.7 per cent in the region of the Vistula, and 0.2 per cent in <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a>. Notwithstanding the difference in types, the Russians constitute a single people, ethnographically divided into three classes, Great Russians, Little Russians, and White Russians. These three ethnographical branches are differentiated from each other by <a href="../cathen/04770a.htm">dialectical</a> differences, domestic traditions and customs, character, and historical tradition. It is difficult to determine the zones of the three branches, or the numbers of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> of which they consist. According to the census of 1897, there were 55,667,469 Great Russians (<em>Velikorussi</em>), 22,380,350 Little Russians (<em>Malorussi</em>), and 5,885,547 White Russians (<em>Bielorussi</em>). At present, there are 65,000,000 Great Russians. They occupy the central and northern parts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia, their centres of population extending from the White Sea to the Caspian Sea and the Sea of Azoff, and are to be found also in <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a> and in the Caucasus. They have <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to Little Russia in considerable numbers; at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Kharkoff was inhabited almost entirely by Little Russians, but in 1897 Great Russians constituted 58 per cent of the population, and the Little Russians only 25 per cent. The Great Russians are active and energetic, and have great aptitude for commerce and work in general. They are regarded as the essentially Russian race, which has not only preserved its known ethnical characteristics under difficult conditions, but has assimilated with itself other races, especially of the Finnish stock. Their language is the predominant tongue of the Russian Empire. The small commerce of the cities is in their hands, as is also the commerce of the wines and fruit that come from Bessarabia, the Crimea and the Don, and the fish from the Black Sea and the Ural River.

<p>The Little Russians inhabit the south of Russia and the basin of the middle and lower course of the Dnieper, and constitute 26.6 per cent of the total population of the empire. Their greatest masses are to be found in the Governments of Pultowa (93 per cent), Tchernigoff (85.6 per cent), Podolia (80.9 per cent), Kharkoff (80.6 per cent), Stavropol (80 per cent), Kieff (79.2 per cent), Volhynia (70.1 per cent), and Yekaterinoslaff (68.9 per cent). The Little Russians are an agricultural people, and remain in their native districts. Their emigrations extend only to the steppes of New Russia, and to the territories of the Don and of the Kuban rivers. Of recent times they have furnished a large contingent to the agricultural colonization of <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a>. From the standpoint of culture that of the Great Russians is superior to that of the Little Russians, although the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> level of Little Russia was much higher than that of Great Russia during the Polish domination. The musical and poetical talents of this people are very much developed and their popular literature abounds in beautiful songs. The difference between Great and Little Russians is not only anthropological, but is also one of temperament and character, the Little Russians protesting that they are not Muscovites; and to emphasize their antipathy for the other race, in the nineteenth century they attempted to give a literary development to their dialect.

<p>The White Russians inhabit the forest and marsh region that is comprised between the Rivers D&uuml;na, Dnieper, Pripet, and Bug. They represent 7 per cent of the total population, and are scattered through the Governments of <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>, Vitebsk, Grodno, Kovno, <a href="../cathen/10333a.htm">Minsk</a>, <a href="../cathen/10428a.htm">Mohileff</a>, Suwalki, and Yelisavetpol. Both physically and intellectually they are less developed Great and Little Russians. According to the Russians, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> inferiority of that people is due to the despotism of Polish masters, under which they lived for several centuries to the loss of their nobility, which became Polish, and to the <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Accordingly, the White Russians are poor, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a>. There is a great admixture of Polish and Lithuanian terms in their dialect. At the present time, however, national sentiment is awakening in the White Russians, who publish newspapers in their own language, and aspire to better their <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> conditions.

<p>Ethnographically, the Caucasians are Great and Little Russians. They are a race of warrior-merchants and agriculturists, who developed the characteristic traits of their social and domestic life in struggles with the Tatars and <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. According to the statistics of 1905, there were 3,370,000 Cossacks in all Russia, or 2.3 per cent of the population of the empire. Those of the Don are Great Russians. They are famous for their military qualities in general, and in particular for the part that they took in the liberation of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> from Polish occupation in 1612, in the conquest of <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of 1812. At present they devote themselves to agriculture, raising cattle, commerce, and military service, and they enjoy many exemptions and privileges. The Cossacks of the Urals are noted for their religious fanaticism. Those of the Kuban and of the Black Sea are of Little Russian origin. They are called Cossacks of "the Line", because, after the Russian conquest of the Caucasus, they built a line of fortified villages on the shores of the Kuban, to defend their new possessions against incursions of the so-called mountaineers of the Caucasus, the Tcherkesy, Tchetchency, Abkhazy, Osetiny, and Lezginy. In their life they have preserved the Little Russian customs and traditions.

<p>Besides the Russian, properly so-called, there are a great many other races that belong politically to Russia. Among the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> races within the Russian frontiers, the most numerous are the Poles, of whom there are 12,000,000, and who chiefly inhabit the region of the Vistula. The <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> and <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a> have <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to the region of New Russia since 1752, forming colonies of peasants. The <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a> allowed themselves to be easily russianized; but the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> showed reluctance to this, and still preserve their national character. The Lithuanians live along the Vilia River and the lower course of the Niemen, at the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> frontier. Their number is given as 3,500,000. They come in succession under Russian, Polish, <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finnish</a>, and Jewish influence. They are fervent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and their <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> conditions are prosperous. Their national sentiment, depressed for several centuries, has awakened in recent times, and nationalist Lithuanians seek to throw off Russian and Polish influence and to form a national literature. Related to the Lithuanians are the Letts (<em>Latyshi</em>); they are a hard-working race and have a high moral standard. Their religion is chiefly <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>; a few of them are of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>.

<p>To the Germanic race belong the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> and Swedes. The Germans of Russia live on the Baltic Sea and on the western frontier, while colonies of them are to be found in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia and in the region of the Volga. In the Baltic region they constitute the higher classes of the population, being for the most part merchants and artisans. They own the greater portion of the land, because, after the imperial manifesto of 19 February, 1861, they freed their serfs (Letts and Esthonians), but did not divide their lands among them. There are over 100,000 of them in this region; in that of the Vistula, there are German colonists, some of whom descend from those who were called by the Polish nobility to occupy the free lands. At the present time, the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> are devoted chiefly to industry, and have established a great many factories, especially at Lodz. There are German colonies on the steppes, which, having the authorization of the Government and special privileges, are prosperous, but which oppose effective resistance to all attempts to russianize them. The Swedes, about 400,000 in number, are concentrated in <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a>, especially in the Governments of Nyland (45 per cent) and Vasa (28.8 per cent). They constitute the aristocratic and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> classes of <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a>; but their political and literary influence, which was considerable, tends to diminish before the development of <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finnish</a> national sentiment.

<p>The Romanic races are represented by about 1,000,000 Moldavians, and by the Wallachians, who inhabit Bessarabia and the western part of the Government of Kherson. They are all of the Orthodox religion, and as a rule are employed in wine production and gardening. They resemble the Little Russians both physically and morally. The Iranian races are represented by about 1,000,000 <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, part of whom inhabit the Little Caucasus; the rest are scattered about the Various cities of the Caucasus and in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia. They are famous for the beauty of their type and for their patriarchal habits. Families are to be found among them numbering as many as fifty <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, who are ruled by the eldest of them. They devote themselves to agriculture and commerce, for the latter of which pursuits they have a special aptitude. They are <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, and reject the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (Armenian-Gregorians), being under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of a <em>katolicos</em> who resides at Etchmiadzin. They have the greatest attachment to their language and the traditions of their mother-country. Among those who live in the Caucasus, there is a considerable literary culture. Several thousands of them are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.

<p>On the shores of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azoff there are several colonies of Greeks who devote themselves to agriculture, and especially to the production of tobacco. There are Greek colonies also in the chief centres of population of Russia, especially at Odessa and St. Petersburg.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are a scattered population, principally in the Governments of Western and Southern Russia. Their presence in Russia is due to emigrations of German <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and they still preserve their dialect of Hebrew German, which is the language of their Press. As elsewhere, they evince the greatest aptitude for commercial matters and the commerce and industry of Western Russia is in their hands. The severe <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> that limit the civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in Russia have concentrated the members of that race in the cities, and the number of workmen and of artisans among them is very great, making their struggle for existence very difficult. Large fortunes are to be found among the Russian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but their masses constitute a proletariat that on various occasions has been the victim of cruel massacres. Among these Russian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> there is the greatest devotion to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish religion</a> and the greatest racial brotherhood. The Government admits only a limited number of them to the establishments of higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>; nevertheless, in the large cities, there is a great number of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who exercise the liberal professions, and especially that of medicine. The number of those who devote themselves to industrial pursuits increases each year.

<p>The Finns inhabit the regions of the Baltic Sea, the Volga, and the Ural Mountains. The Finns, properly so-called, who inhabit Finland are 2,500,000 in number. For several centuries they were under the domination of <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, by which country they were barred from western civilization. They are famous for their honesty, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of their country and traditions (they are <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>), their high <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> level (there are scarcely any illiterate among them), the status of their <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> (the University of Helsingfors has six hundred <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> students, and the Parliament of Helsingfors has twenty-two <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> members), and their tenacity of character, by which they have transformed the poor soil of <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a>. The progress of the Finns during the last fifty years has been considerable, but in 1910 the Government suppressed the liberty and autonomy of <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a>, and possibly thereby has placed a barrier to the development of <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finnish</a> culture. The Korely, who live to the north of Lakes Ladoga and Onega, and of whom there are 210,000, are Baltic Finns; there are also small groups of them between Lake Ilmen and the Volga. They have been more amenable to russianization, and have embraced the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The Esthonians occupy the southern part of the plain of the Baltic. There are 1,300,000 of them, who constitute a class of poor peasants, among whom remain many traditions and customs of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>. They are mostly <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>.

<p>The Finns of the Volga comprise the Tcheremisy, the Mordva, and the Tchuvashi. The first, to the number of 400,000, live on the banks of the Volga, in the Governments of Kazan and of Vyatka. They were <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by the Russian missionaries, but they remain <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> at heart, and in their customs. They devote themselves to agriculture, the chase, lumber commerce, and fishing. Their villages are small, having each not more than thirty houses. They are poor but honest, theft being regarded among them as a grave offence. The Tchuvashi are 800,000 in number; they live on the right bank of the Volga, and their chief centres of population are in the Governments of Kazan, Orenburg, Simbirsk, and Saratoff. Although they are Finns, they have adopted Russian customs, and tend more and more to become russianized. From the eighteenth century the Russian missionaries have attempted to convert them to <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, and have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> a great number of them; but the Tchuvashi preserve a basis of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> that is revealed in their rite and in their creed. Agriculture is their favourite pursuit, but they devote themselves also to the culture of bees, and they supply the markets of St. Petersburg with poultry and eggs.

<p>Other less important races are mentioned by Russian geographers. The total number of the various nationalities that constitute the Russian Empire is about one hundred. Their multiplicity, which transforms Russia into a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> ethnographical museum, is an obstacle in the way of civilization, to the dissemination of instruction, and to the stability of the representative system.
<h2>Administrative divisions</h2>

<p>For the purposes of administration Russia is divided into six great territorial regions: <ul><li>(1) <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia, properly so-called; <li>(2) the Governments of the Vistula (Privislanskila gubernii); <li>(3) the Grand duchy of <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a>; <li>(4) the Caucasus; <li>(5) Siberia; <li>(6) Central <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>.</ul>

<p>These territories are divided into governments (<em>gubernii</em>) and provinces (<em>oblasti</em>). The governments are ruled with <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> that are called "Statutes of the Governments" (<em>Polozhenie o guberniiazh</em>); the provinces, besides the general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> have special <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> that are made <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> by the great number of non-Russians and of the non-Orthodox who inhabit those regions. The governments are divided into districts called <em>uiezdy</em>, and the provinces into districts called <em>okrugi</em>. The number of these districts, both in the governments and provinces, varies from four to fifteen. The districts are divided into <em>volosti, selskiia obshestva</em>, etc. The <em>okrugi</em> are divided into military, judicial, scholastic, postal, etc. In <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia there are seven <em>gradonatchalstva</em>, i.e., cities that have administrations independent of the governments and provinces in which they are situated: these are St. Petersburg, <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, Odessa, Rostoff-on-the-Don, Sebastopol, Kertch-Yenikale, and Nikolaieff. Kronstadt constitutes a separate military government.

<p><a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia contains fifty-nine governments and two provinces. The governments of the Vistula, consisting of the territory of the former Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> that was annexed to Russia (<em>carstvo polskoe</em>), belong to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia. They enjoyed a certain autonomy until the revolution of 1863 led the Russian Government to suppress all their privileges and to employ every means for their russianization. After the liberal edicts of 1905 it was hoped that autonomy would be restored to the Russian Poles; but these hopes are far from being realized. The Grand duchy of <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a>, which was united to Russia in 1809 as an integral part of the empire, enjoyed a special autonomy that gave an admirable development to the culture and prosperity of that land. The Finns had a code of special <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> a diet, senate, bank, <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a>, and postal service. After 1905 there was universal suffrage, and the new chamber of deputies admitted <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> also to its membership. In 1910, however, the <em>Duma</em> approved a bill relating to <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a>, which, if carried into effect, would bring Finnish autonomy to an end. Finland is divided into eight governments. In the Caucasus, where the Russian population is in a minority, besides the various governments, there are provinces where special <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> are in force. Siberia is divided into governments and provinces. Among the latter the Island of Sakhalin, with an area of 14,836 sq. miles, has a population of 17,900. The southern portion of this island, however, was ceded to <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> by the treaty of <a href="../cathen/12296a.htm">Portsmouth</a>, 16-29 August, 1905. The governments and provinces of <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a> are eight in number. <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> Russia has provinces (<em>oblasti</em>) only, because the Russians constitute only a small minority of the population.
<h2>Agriculture, and condition of the peasants</h2>

<p>Russia is a great agricultural nation; three-quarters of its population derive their support from the soil, which furnishes the most important resources of the country. The statistics concerning agriculture date from 1877-78, and were collected by the Central Committee of Statistics. More precise information was gathered by the same committee in 1886-88, and in 1905. According to the latest of these statistics, there were in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia, exclusive of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, 1,067,019,596 acres of cultivated land, besides 17,609,124 acres in the Kalmuck steppes, and 19,133,296 in the steppes of the Kirghiz. The cultivated lands are divided into three classes: <ul><li>(1) private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> (274,685,426 acres); <li>(2) lands granted by the government to the peasants or <em>nadiel'nyja zemli</em> (374,672,484 acres); <li>(3) lands belonging to the treasury, the churches, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, cities, and institutions (417,661,685).</ul>

<p>A comparison of these statistics with those of 1877 shows that in 1905 the lands owned by the nobles had diminished in area by 53,851,008 acres, and those of foreign subjects by 341,679 acres. On the other hand the landed <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the peasants had increased by 20,051,428 acres, and that of the other social classes had increased proportionately. In Siberia all the land, except the southern part of the Government of Tomsk which belongs to the imperial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, is the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the Government, for as yet only a small portion has been granted to public and private institutions.

<p>The state lands of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia are distributed very irregularly. In the Governments of Archangel, Olonetz, and Vologda, the State owns from 83 to 90 per cent of the land; in the region of Tchernozom, 5 per cent, and in the Governments of Pultowa, Bessarabia, and in Esthonia less than 1 per cent. The lands granted to the peasants occupy more than half of the Governments of Orenburg, Vyatka, Ufa, Kazan, Penza, Voronezh, Samara, the Province of the Don, Vladimir, Ryazan, Kursk, <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, Kaluga, Kharkoff, Tchernigoff, and Pultowa. Of the lands that are private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, 52 per cent belong to the nobility, 24 per cent to the peasants, 16 per cent to the merchants, and the remainder is divided among other classes. The possessions of the nobility are chiefly in the Baltic region, <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a>, and the Governments of <a href="../cathen/10333a.htm">Minsk</a>, Perm, Podolia, and Kieff. In the period between 1860 and 1905 the rural <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the nobility, which had reached 213,300,000 acres, was reduced to 143,100,000 acres. The great landowners, possessing more than 2700 acres each, are chiefly in the eastern governments and in those of the Baltic. The arable lands of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> occupy an area of 30,312,168 acres of which 44.56 per cent belong to private owners, 45.58 per cent to the peasants through government concessions, 4.02 per cent to the cities, and 5.84 per cent to the churches and other institutions. The land belonging to the churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the whole of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia, including <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, is estimated at 0.6 per cent of all the arable land of that division of the empire.

<p>There are 591,788 rural villages in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia, with a total population of 81,050,300, of whom 84.5 per cent are peasants. According to statistics, 38.8 per cent of the total surface is forest; 26.2 per cent is arabic land; 19.1 per cent is land not available for cultivation; and 15.9 per cent is prairies and pasture lands. The lands unavailable for cultivation are the salt steppes, the marshes, and the <em>tundras</em>. In Finland these lands occupy 35.6 per cent of the country, and the proportion is still greater in <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a> and Turkestan, where the arable land is only 2 per cent.

<p>The "extensive" and the "intensive" systems of cultivation are variously applied in Russia, according to the region. In the governments of Northern Russia (Archangel, Olonetz, Vologda, Novgorod, and in parts of Yaroslaff, Kostroma, Vyatka, and Perm) the system called <em>podsietchnaja</em> obtains, consisting in stripping and uprooting the forests, planting wheat on their sites for intervals of from three to nine years, and then allowing the forests to grow up again when the fertility of the soil has been exhausted. In the Governments of Kherson, Yekaterinoslaff, Taurida, Stavropol, Orenburg, the Province of the Urals, and the Province of the Don Cossacks is practised the method called <em>zalezhnaia</em> (Fr. <em>jach&egrave;re</em>). This consists in cultivating the land while its productive power endures; then it is transformed into pasture, and its cultivation is not resumed for an interval of ten, twelve, or fifteen years, as occasion may require. The intensive method of agriculture obtains in the central governments of Russia, in the zone of Tchernozom, and in other governments. A field is divided into three sections; in the first, winter grain (rye, corn) is sown; in the second, a crop of summer grain is put in (wheat, barley, oats); and in the third, grass for pasture is allowed to grow; each year the crop of each section is changed for one of the other two, thus allowing each section to rest once in three years. In the regions of the Vistula and the Baltic and in the south-western part of <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a> the intensive system of agriculture obtains; no portion of the land remains untilled, but the peasants sow seed and plant vegetables in alternate years, so as not to exhaust the productiveness of the soil. In several regions, especially in the Caucasus, in Daghestan, Transcaucasia, and Turkestan, a remedy is found for the aridity of the soil in irrigation by means of canals. In other regions of a marshy character the work of draining the swamps is carried on, at times by the Government, and at times by private parties. In Podlachia alone, from 1874 to 1892, there were reclaimed 6,210,000 acres of swamp lands. The same kind of work was accomplished in Siberia.

<p>Russia is a great cereal-producing country. According to the statistics of 1908, in 73 governments (63 in Russian <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, 1 in Transcaucasia, 4 in <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a>, and 5 in Central <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>), out of 327,642,983 acres of land, 56.2 per cent were devoted to the culture of cereals, 3.2 per cent to the culture of the potato, 13.9 per cent to the oat crop, and 26.7 per cent to artificial meadow lands. In 1908 the grain crop amounted to 48,000,000 tons; the potato crop yielded 29,000,000 tons; oats, 13,000,000 tons, and hay from artificial meadows, 47,000,000 tons. The governments that are the most productive of cereals are those of Bessarabia, Kherson, Taurida, Yekaterinoslaff, and the Province of the Don Cossacks. As a cereal-producing country, Russia is the second in the world, the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> being the first. The development of potato culture, which was introduced into Russia in 1767, is notable. The grain that Russia produces is not only sufficient to supply the home market, but also constitutes one of the chief exports. The amount of it that is exported amounts on an average to 15,000,000 tons a year. It should be noticed, however, that in proportion to the area of the empire, the grain production of Russia is not high: <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, the combined area of which countries is only one-third of that of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia, produce together more grain than is produced in all Russia.

<p>There are abundant crops of other staples, also, that Russia produces; these are the flax crop, which yields 500,000 tons a year, produced in several of the governments of the north-east, north-west, and south; hemp, 400,000 tons; cotton, raised in Transcaucasia and Turkestan, especially in the Province of Ferghana, annual yield more than 170,000 tons. Tobacco was introduced into Russia in the seventeenth century; its use was prohibited by severe <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> but was allowed from the time of Peter the Great; it is cultivated in the Governments of Tchernigoff, Pultowa, Samara, Saratoff, Taurida, Bessarabia, Kuban, etc. Its annual yield is about 100,000 tons, while the lands that are devoted to its cultivation cover an area of 1,755,000 acres. The principal tobacco factories are at St. Petersburg, <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, Riga, Kieff, and Odessa. The culture of beets, introduced into Russia about the beginning of the nineteenth century, has been greatly developed during the last thirty years, there being now devoted to it an aggregate area of 1,485,000 acres, the greater portion of which is in the Governments of Kieff and Podolia, the annual crop amounting to 10,000 tons. Wine is not extensively produced in Russia, and is of inferior quality. The best vineyards are in the Crimea, in Kakhetia, and in the Province of the Don Cossacks. There are 729,000 acres devoted to vine culture, and the yearly product amounts to not more than 88 million gallons. The Government seeks to encourage the home production of wine by very high <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> on foreign wines. The culture of vegetables and fruit is not greatly developed; market gardens thrive in the neighbourhood of the large cities, especially in the District of Rostoff, and in the Governments of Saratoff and Samara. The production of fruit is abundant in Transcaucasia and the Crimea.

<p>According to the statistics of 1908 there were in Russia 140,656,000 head of cattle, namely, 28,723,000 horses, 42,031,000 horned cattle, 57,466,000 sheep and goats, and 12,436,000 hogs. The horned cattle are scattered over the whole of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia: the cattle of <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a> are of a better class, on account of the abundance of forests. There are numerous breeds of horses in Russia, and special establishments are devoted to the improvement of these breeds in the Province of the Don Cossacks and the Governments of Voronezh, Kherson, Tamboff, Pultowa, and Kharkoff. The annual product from the sheep is calculated at 120,000,000 roubles (1 rouble=52 cents U. S. A.). The best wool is produced by the flocks of the Governments of Novgorod and Voronezh, of the Volga, the Vistula, the Baltic, the Caucasus, and Turkestan. The raising of hogs is especially pursued in the Governments of <a href="../cathen/10333a.htm">Minsk</a> and Volhynia. The chicken industry flourishes in Western and Central Russia; fowls and eggs are exported and yield an annual income of more than 70,000,000 roubles, of which 61,000,000 are for eggs. The yearly production of honey is nearly 26,000 tons, and wax 5000 tons, yielding an aggregate income of from 15,000,000 to 20,000,000 roubles. The culture of the silk-worm is being developed, chiefly in the Governments of Bessarabia, Kherson, and Taurida, and in <a href="../cathen/15095a.htm">Turkestan</a> and the Caucasus. The yearly production of silk amounts to about 1000 tons.

<p>The condition of the peasants, although greatly improved, is far from being prosperous, and the agrarian question is one of the gravest with which Russian statesmen have to deal. Prior to 1861, or since 1592 according to some authorities, 1649 according to others, the peasants were legally reduced to servitude (<em>kriepostnoe pravo</em>). They were under serfdom to the landowners, were attached to the soil, and were not allowed to change their place of residence or dispose freely of their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>; they were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to cultivate the lands of their employers and pay a tax to the State. The <em>pomieshshiki</em>, or landowners, became so many little tsars, and the peasants were reduced to the condition of slaves. As a consequence there occurred the revolts of the peasants, in the seventeenth century, under Stenko Razin, and in the eighteenth century, under Pugatcheff. During the reign of Catherine II a Russian author, Radishsheff, in his "Voyage from St. Petersburg to <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>", suggested the necessity of freeing the peasants from their servitude; the book was held to be dangerous, and its author was exiled to Siberia. Paul I in 1797 alleviated the condition of the peasants by decreeing that they should work only three days on the lands of their employers. Alexander I attempted in vain to free them: his humanitarian efforts were thwarted by the opposition of the nobles. Nicholas I entertained the same purpose, but notwithstanding his absolutism was unable to realize it; he <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> various <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> however (1826, 1835, 1839, 1845, 1846, 1847, and 1848), by which the right of the peasants and of their communities (<em>mir</em>) to acquire real estate was recognized; but these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were not executed, and the <em>pomieshshiki</em> pretended to be uninformed of them.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> revolution of 1848 and the Crimean War brought an awakening of Liberal <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> in Russia, and Alexander II, as one of the first measures of his reign, abolished serfdom. The preparatory measures for this consummation were studied by a secret committee in 1857. In 1859 the committees of the nobility and of the <em>pomieshshiki</em> in the various provinces discussed this question of the abolition of serfdom, and the Press dealt with it in an active way, showing Russia's moral and political need to solve it. An imperial commission, established in 1859, prepared a law which, after long deliberations and frequent modifications, received the signature of the tsar, 12 Feb., 1861, and was <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> on 5 March of the same year. The terms of this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> made all peasants free, and secured to them, upon the payment of a tax established by law, the use of their habitations (<em>dvor</em>) and a grant of land, of which they could become owners in fee simple by pecuniary <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>. Moreover, the <em>pomieshshiki</em> were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to grant to the peasants or to the <em>mir</em> the lands occupied by them, conformably with a maximum or minimum established by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. On the other hand, the <em>dvorovie</em>, or servants, who numbered 1,500,000, in 1861 regained their freedom, with however the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of serving their masters for a further period of two years.

<p>The lands were so distributed that each peasant who was entitled to share in them received, on an average, fourteen acres; on an average, because the quality of the lands was taken into account in the distribution; in the zone of the Tchernozom, the concessions were of eight acres. Moreover, the distribution of lands was very unequal, and 42.6 per cent of the peasants who participated in it received concessions that were insufficient for their needs; to this may be added that many millions of peasants were not benefited by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and that the annual tax to be paid to the Government by those who received portions of land became a burden. The Government therefore continued to enact <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> to solve the agrarian question. The taxes were diminished in 1881, and in 1882 the Agrarian Bank was established, which helped the peasants to acquire possession of 19,000,000 acres in a few years. In 1885 the <em>per capita</em> tax paid by the peasants was abolished, by which the Government lost 50,000,000 roubles. Other <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> some of them <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> as late as 1900, are directed towards the protection of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the peasants. These measures, however, are insufficient. The increase in the population has greatly reduced the average holding of land, which in 1893 amounted to 6.5 acres for each peasant. The improvidence of the peasants, drink, backward methods in agriculture, and bad crops have on more than one occasion caused famine to be felt in the agricultural regions. The agrarian question, therefore, lies like an incubus on Russia, while the various parties of the Duma propose different solutions for it. The moderate parties advise directing the peasant emigration towards Siberia, dispersing the peasants in less populous governments, and imparting to them agricultural instruction; while the more advanced parties demand that the crown lands and the lands of the churches and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> be divided among the peasants, or again that the great landowners be deprived of their rural possessions (socialization of lands). Until now, however, the debates that have taken place in the various dumas on this subject have led to no practical results.
<h2>Statistics of commerce</h2>

<p>According to the statistics of 1908 Russia occupies the ninth place among nations as regards her merchant fleet, which including that of <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a> has 6250 ships, with a gross tonnage of 1,046,195; this includes 1240 steamers with a tonnage of 500,000. Finland has 2800 ships, with a tonnage of 346,195. The ships of more than 1000 tons burden in the Russian merchant fleet number 114. Of Russian vessels, 1129 belong to the Black Sea ports and the Sea of Azoff, and 1104 to the Baltic ports. According to the statistics of the same year, there arrived at Russian ports during 1908 11,011 ships, of which 1777 were Russian, with an aggregate tonnage of 1,241,000, and 9519 foreign, aggregate tonnage 9,519,000. The chief centres of Russian maritime commerce are the ports of the Baltic, the Black Sea, and the Sea of Azof. The foreign maritime commerce of Russia is divided by tonnage as follows: <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 42 per cent; <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, 16 per cent; <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, 10 per cent; Greece, 8 per cent; and Sweden and <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, 4 per cent.

<p>The coasting trade between small ports is reserved exclusively for Russian shipping; it has found its greatest development in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azof (36,590 ships, 15,098,000 tons), in the Caspian Sea (16,538 ships, 8,884,000 tons), and in the Baltic Sea (10,809 ships, 1,230,000 tons). This shipping carries on an average 10,000,000 tons of merchandise a year, of which 4,400,000 tons are petroleum, and 1,100,000 tons grain. The great coasting commerce between the Black and the Baltic Seas, between the ports of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Russia and those of Eastern Siberia, and between the Murman coasts (<em>Murmanskii bereg</em>) and the Baltic Sea, employs 212 steamships, of an aggregate tonnage of 450,000, carrying a yearly average of 270,000 tons of merchandise. The most important commercial ports of Russia are St. Petersburg, Riga, Libau, Reval, and Odessa. According to the most recent statistics, the river fleet consists of 3300 steam and 22 860 other craft, with an aggregate tonnage of 11,200,000. The yards that build this shipping are at Nizhni-Novgorod, St. Petersburg, <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, Perm, and in <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a>. The river fleet carries a yearly average of 32,000,000 tons of merchandise, of an aggregate value of 800,000,000 roubles.

<p>The first railway that was constructed in Russia was that of Tsarskoi Selo in 1837; in 1850, Russian railways had 666 miles of line, which had increased to 7094 miles in 1870, to 14,786 in 1880, and to 20,000 in 1890. The greater portion of these was constructed by private companies, and in 1882 13,582 of a total of 15,724 miles of railway belonged to those companies. In 1908 the railway mileage of Russia amounted to 45,132 miles, of which 35,076 were in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, 2078 in <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a>, and 7978 in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. At present four-fifths of these railways belong to the State, and one-fifth to private parties. In 1909 there were 270 miles of new railways opened and the construction of 3074 miles more was determined upon. Russia has the second railway mileage of the world, being second only to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>; but compared with the area of the empire, the railway mileage of Russia is small. The railway centre of Russia is <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>. The Trans-Siberian Railway is the greatest enterprise of modern Russia: it has made possible the exploitation of the natural riches of Siberia, and has opened a way for the commerce of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> with the Far East. Its construction was begun in 1891, and finished in 1903, at a cost of 850,000,000 roubles. It has a length of 5532 miles. After the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, the branch to Port Arthur became a part of the Eastern <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> Railway. The voyage from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to Shanghai, which takes forty-five days by the Suez Canal, and thirty-five days by <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and the Pacific Ocean, is made in from eighteen to twenty days over the Trans-Siberian Railway by way of Vladivostok. The total value of the Russian railways is 5,500,000,000 roubles, and their average cost is estimated at 169,500 roubles per mile.

<p>In foreign commerce, exports and imports, Russia occupies the seventh place among commercial nations, the imports and exports representing a value approximately of 2,000,000,000 roubles (in 1906, 800,000,000 roubles of imports, and 547,500,000 roubles of exports). This commerce to the amount of 1,545,000,000 roubles is carried on across the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> frontiers; 268,000,000 roubles across <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> frontiers; and 83,000,000 roubles across the frontiers of <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a>. Russia exports wheat, barley, oats, rye, and corn to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, etc.; eggs, sugar, butter, caviar, fish, fowls, petroleum, cattle, and raw minerals; and imports woollen textiles amounting to 25,000,000 roubles, worked metals, paints, and dyes, coal, silk, rubber goods, machinery, watches, tea (in 1906, 90,000 tons of this commodity were imported at a cost of 77,000,000 roubles), herrings, wines (11,000,000 roubles), lemons and oranges (4,500,000 roubles), other fruits, etc.

<p>The internal commerce of Russia is greatly developed by the periodical markets or fairs, of which 26,000 are held in 6830 different places. The most important one of them is that of Nizhni-Novgorod, originating in the seventeenth century near the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Blessed Macarius, which was built within the Government of Nizhni-Novgorod. To that market <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, Tatars, and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> went in great numbers. In 1816 the fair was transferred to Novgorod, a city which, on account of its position at the confluence of the Volga and the Oka Rivers, possessed the requisites for becoming a great commercial centre; the commercial importance of the fair increased rapidly; it was visited by as many as 200,000 merchants from all parts of Russia and Siberia. The value of the merchandise brought to this market, which amounted to 32,000,000 roubles in 1817 attained a sum of 246,000,000 roubles in 1881, after which it fell to a yearly average of from 160 to 170 million roubles. The fair is held from 15 July to 25 Aug., the chief commodities being silk, cotton, linen and woollen goods, worked metals, and skins. Another important fair is that of Irbit, in the Government of Perm. This fair originated in 1643; it is held from 1 Feb. to 1 March, the value of the merchandise brought to it being estimated at 30,000,000 roubles each year. In Little Russia these fairs are frequently held; among them the most noted are those of the Epiphany, at Kharkoff, from 6 to 26 Jan. (merchandise of a value of from 11 to 13 million roubles); those of the Assumption, the Intercession of the Blessed Virgin, and the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, in the same city, from 15 Aug. to 1 Sept., 1 to 15 July, and 1 Oct. to 1 Nov. respectively; the fair of Kieff, from 5 to 26 Feb.; those of Kursk, Simbirsk, Menzelinsk, Ivanoffskaia etc. The growth of the railways tends to diminish the importance and volume of business of these fairs. The number of commercial establishments in Russia (statistics of 1907) is 889,746, and the number of people engaged in commerce is 1,600,000.
<h2>Industries, and condition of the workers</h2>

<p>Russian industries have been greatly developed, although they are far from being in a position to supply the home demand. In 1906 there were in Russia 14,247 industrial establishments, in which there were 1,684,569 workers; in 1907 the number of those establishments had decreased to 14,190, while the workers had increased to 1,723,173. The industrial districts are those of St. Petersburg (2049 establishments, 296,109 workers), <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> (2485 establishments, 610,402 workers), Warsaw (2978 establishments, 268,256 workers), Kieff (2791 establishments, 207,751 workers), the Volga (1768 establishments, 137,235 workers), and Kharkoff (2119 establishments, 203,424 workers). The number of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> employed in these establishments increases continually, and grew from 383,782 in 1901 to 435,684 in 1906.

<p>The metal industries are the most important. Under Peter the Great there was declared the so-called freedom of mines (<em>gornaia svoboda</em>), according to which the ownership of a mine was independent of that of the land under which it was found. This law was revoked by Catherine II in 1781, to the detriment of the metallurgical industries. According to the latest statistics, the number of workmen employed in these industries is 700,000, of whom more than half are employed in the extraction and working of iron. The value of the yearly output of the metallurgical industries is 300,000,000 roubles. Russia holds an important position as a gold-producing country: in 1906 Siberia, the Urals, and Finland produced 30 tons of gold. The average production of gold each year, from sand and quartz, amounts to 80,960 lb., of a value of 60,000,000 roubles. Russia occupies the fourth place among gold-producing countries. The Province of Irkutsk, in Eastern Siberia, is the chief gold region of the country, and especially the District of Olekminsk, which produces 6 tons of the metal. By the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of 12 March, 1901, and 1 March, 1902, the prohibition that had been placed upon free commerce in gold was removed. There are 80,000 workers employed in the gold industries of the country.

<p>Russia may be said to be the only platinum-producing country. This metal is taken from the Urals, where it was discovered in 1819, the yearly production of it amounting to 5 tons, although in 1906 the amount was 5/12; tons. It is mined in the Government of Perm, giving employment to 1292 men, and is usually sold to the British at a price of 806,000 roubles per ton; when refined in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, it is sold for 1,240,000 roubles per ton. The production of silver, which from 1886 to 1890 was 16 tons a year, has decreased to 6 tons yearly. The metal is mined in the Districts of Nertchinsk and the Altai, and in the Governments of <a href="../cathen/16081b.htm">Viborg</a> and Archangel.

<p>Russia has produced copper since the seventeenth century, and her annual production of that metal increases continually: from 8,300 tons in 1905, it increased to 70,000 tons in 1906, and to 14,000 in 1907. There are 22 establishments devoted to the copper industry; the metal is mined chiefly in the Caucasus and in the Urals, and to a small extent in the steppes of the Kirghiz and in the Altai Mountains. Lead is usually found in Russia mixed with silver, and is obtained in the Province of Terek and the Districts of Nertchinsk and the Altai. An exact average of the yearly production of lead cannot be established; in 1890 it amounted to 800 tons; in 1895 to 400 tons; in 1904 to only 80 tons while it increased to 770 tons in 1905, and to 1000 tons in 1906. Zinc is furnished by four great establishments, situated respectively at Bendzin, Constantin, Paulina (Government of Piotrkow), and Alagir, in the Province of Terek. The production of this metal yielded 8100 tons in 1902, 14,000 tons in 1904, and 10,000 tons in 1906. Mercury was discovered in 1879 in the District of Bakhmut (Government of Yekaterinoslaff), and its yearly production amounts to 320 tons. Manganese, which is worked chiefly in the Governments of Kutais and of Yekaterinoslaff, yielded a production of 320 tons in 1898, 790 tons in 1900, and 500 tons in 1905.

<p>Russia produces great quantities of iron. The first establishments for the working of this metal originated in the seventeenth century and were the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the State. In 1906 the total production of iron amounted to 5,183,579 tons. There are 126 foundries which produce 2,700,000 tons of melted iron. Russia occupies the seventh place among the coal-producing countries. The first coal was mined in the reign of Peter I, but the coal industry was only developed to any extent under Catherine II, and that development continues from year to year. The production of this mineral amounted to 25,000,000 tons in 1906. Russia is exceptionally rich in petroleum. Many of its oil deposits are yet undeveloped, especially in the Governments of <a href="../cathen/08636a.htm">Kielce</a> and Taurida, and in the Urals. The greatest supply of Russian petroleum now comes from the northern and southern slopes of the Caucasus Mountains, especially from the Government of Baku (90 per cent), from the Provinces of Terek, Kuban, and Daghestan, from the Government of Tiflis, and from the Transcaspian region. In 1907 the total production of petroleum in Russia amounted to 8,300,000 tons. The petroleum exported in 1908 represented a value of 30,000,000 roubles.

<p>Among salt-producing countries Russia holds the fourth place, producing from mines and salt lakes a yearly average of more than 1,770,000 tons of salt, chiefly from the Governments of Yekaterinoslaff, Astrakhan, Perm, and Taurida. The textile industry holds an important place, there being 2000 factories, employing 700,000 workers, and producing fabrics valued at 800,000,000 roubles a year. Of those establishments 730 are cotton factories, which employ 437,000 workers, and produce a yearly output valued at 520,000,000 roubles. The principal establishments for the cleaning of cotton are in <a href="../cathen/15095a.htm">Turkestan</a> and the Government of Erivan. Factories for spinning and weaving cotton first appeared in Russia during the second half of the eighteenth century; the principal ones among them at the present time are in the Governments of Vladimir, <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, Piotrkow, St. Petersburg, Kostroma, Terek, and Yaroslaff. The wool industry has 916 factories that produce an aggregate yearly income of nearly 170,000,000 roubles. Russia has 145 linen factories that produce a yearly income of 42,000,000 roubles. The silk industry, which was introduced at the beginning of the eighteenth century, had in 1900 200 factories (Governments of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, Vladimir, and Piotrkow), and was producing a yearly income of 23,000,000 roubles.

<p>The flour industry is an important one, there being 1400 large mills, the yearly products of which are valued at 225,000,000 roubles, besides which there are 20,000 small mills. The distillation of spirits, made free in 1863, is another important industry, there being 2480 distilleries with a yearly production of 89,100,000 gallons. There are 80 distilleries for the production of vodka, which has become a government monopoly, and the yearly product of which is 2,160,000 gallons, chiefly in the Governments of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> and St. Petersburg. The brewing of beer was begun in Russia more especially in the nineteenth century, and as a beer-producing country Russia occupies the sixth place, having 918 breweries with a yearly product of 162,000,000 gallons. Russia also produces sugar. In the eighteenth century it had 7 refineries. The first refinery for the production of beet sugar was established in 1802. At present there are 280 beet sugar factories and refineries, which in 1908 produced 1,300,000 tons. There are 294 oil factories, where oil is extracted from sunflower seed, linseed, and hempseed.

<p>There are 827 workshops where industrial machinery is made, the value of their annual products being estimated at 208,000,000 roubles. Fourteen large establishments in the Governments of St. Petersburg, Livonia, <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, and Nizhni-Novgorod construct locomotives and railway cars, of a value of 92,000,000 roubles. The goldsmith's industry, which flourishes in the Governments of <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, St. Petersburg, and <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, yields an annual income of 5,500,000 roubles. Electrical works, of which there are 50 in the Government of St. Petersburg, have made their appearance within recent years; their annual product is valued at 8,000,000 roubles. The paper industry is an ancient one in Russia, dating from the sixteenth century. There are at present 451 factories. The wood industry is represented in the first place by 956 saw-mills, the yearly products of which are estimated at 70,000,000 roubles; and secondly by 250 furniture factories, with a yearly output of 14,000,000 roubles. The yearly production of the 174 chemical factories in Russia is estimated at 32,000,000 roubles. Tanning, which was practised in Russia as far back as the ninth and tenth centuries, is now carried on in 641 tanneries that produce a yearly output of 55,000,000 roubles. The glass industry also is important in Russia, where it made its appearance in the seventeenth century, under the Tsar Michael Theodorovitch (212 factories, and a yearly output of 26,000,000 roubles).

<p>The material and the moral conditions of the working people leave a great deal to be desired. The wages are low in proportion to the cost of living in Russian cities, and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not give the workman sufficient protection against exploitation by his employer. It may be said that there are no sanitary <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> with regard to workers in factories, although this matter has been considered by various commissions, established by the Government in 1859, 1870, 1874, and 1892. Sickness and accidents are frequent among the workmen: in 1871 in 17,533 establishments, employing 1,700,000 workers, there were 24,744 accidents, of which 385 were fatal. To these may be added 23,360 injuries through accident in the mines, making a total of 48,104; these official figures seem too low to represent the facts. The insurance <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> have only 600,000 workers inscribed on their lists; and in case of accident it is very difficult to obtain payment from those companies. There is want of medical assistance. The moral standard is very low. It is therefore no wonder that the <a href="../cathen/08719a.htm">working</a> class takes an active part in revolutionary movements and furnishes a large percentage of highway robbers.
<h2>Intellectual Russia</h2>

<p>Intellectual culture is of recent date, and was first developed in Southern and Western Russia under Polish influence. The first Russian academy was established at Kieff in the seventeenth century. In Muscovite Russia <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> culture began under Peter the Great, who gave much attention to the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the people. Catherine II established the first <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls. Under Alexander II a great number of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and of establishments for higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> were opened, and this <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> development was carried to Siberia by the foundation of the University of Tomsk under Alexander III. Higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> is represented by ten <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>: St. Petersburg, <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, Kieff, Odessa, Kharkoff, <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, Kazan, Yurieff (Dorpat), Helsingfors, and Tomsk. Two other <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> are about to be established by the Government, at Saratoff and Tobolsk. In 1909 the ten <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> just named were attended by 36,890 students, those having the greatest number of students being the Universities of St. Petersburg (8805), <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> (8698), Kharkoff (4048), and Kieff (4230); on the other hand, Warsaw has only fifteen students, being <a href="../cathen/16012a.htm">boycotted</a> by the Poles on account of the exclusive use of the Russian language. The most frequented courses are those of law (13,970 students), physics and mathematics (8778 students), and medicine (7068 students). There is a notable attendance of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> (500) at the University of Helsingfors. The nine Russian <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> are maintained by the State at an expense of 5,405,660 roubles a year, to which should be added other amounts of regular receipts, making a sum total of 7,684,000 roubles. The University of Helsingfors is supported by Finland at a cost of 806,700 roubles, of which 173,700 roubles are furnished by the public treasury.

<p>Russian <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, some of which date from the eighteenth or even the seventeenth century, received their first impetus from Alexander I (1801-25), who founded the Universities of Kharkoff, Kazan, and St. Petersburg. Under Nicholas I (1825-55), they ran the risk of being closed, and were subjected to a rule of superintendence and severe discipline. In 1863 the minister Golovin introduced important reforms into the organization and administration of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, and conferred many privileges upon the professors and students, which privileges were limited by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 23 Aug., 1884. The regular professors receive a salary of 3000 roubles a year; the supplementary professors receive 2000 roubles, and the <em>dozents</em> 1000 roubles. The various <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> have in their faculties men of superior attainments, who are an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. Those institutions are distinguished also for their Liberal sentiments, which in 1905-07 degenerated into excesses, and on various occasions transformed the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> into hotbeds of political agitation.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> culture of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> has its centres in the so-called "Superior Course" (<em>Vysshie kursy</em>) of St. Petersburg (2396 students) and of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> (2177 students), and in the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women's</a> medical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of St. Petersburg (1635 students). In the "Superior Courses", the greater portion of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> students take up the study of history and of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. The one at St. Petersburg is maintained at a cost of 217,530 roubles a year; the corresponding one at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> at 153,000 roubles a year, and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women's</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of medicine at a cost of 573,926 roubles. There are many scholarships for poor students, men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. The Russian <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who frequent the "Superior Courses" are, as a rule, from eighteen to twenty-five years of age, and are distinguished by their quickness of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and energy of character, and also by a decrease of womanly qualities.

<p>According to the statistics of 1907, secondary instruction for men is given in 246 <em>gymnasia</em> and 37 <em>pro-gymnasia</em>, having 2912 classes, 4668 masters, and 107,296 students; for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, in 433 <em>gymnasia</em> and 172 <em>pro-gymnasia</em>, with 5432 classes, 10,272 teachers, and 200,761 students, and in 178 <em>Realschulen</em>, 1590 classes, 2538 teachers, and 55,499 students. In the <em>gymnasia</em>, the course lasts seven years; Greek, Latin, French, and German are taught at these institutions, as also the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, history, geography, Russian literature, and the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>. The <em>pro-gymnasia</em> teach the same subjects, with the exception of the dead languages. The <em>Realschulen</em> impart a practical <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. In the <em>gymnasia</em> for girls, the course is six years. To the number of these <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> must be added the institutes and the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of teachers (<em>utchitel'skie instituty, utchitel'skija seminarii</em>), there being 10 of the former, with 143 professors, and 1738 students; and 73 of the latter, with 909 professors, and 12,355 students.

<p>There are in the whole of Russia, including Finland, 111,427 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for primary instruction, attended by 6,875,765 scholars, of whom 4,691,691 are boys. To this class belong the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> that were instituted 13 July, 1884, and were placed under the direct control of the Synod. The scope of these <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> is chiefly religious; they teach the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law of God</a>, reading, writing, and arithmetic; some of them have only one class; some two; in the second class, when there is one, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and national history are taught. The remuneration received by the teachers of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> is often as low as 150 roubles a year. In the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> that depend upon the Ministry of Public Instruction, the salaries of teachers are 500 or 600 roubles a year. In 1909 the ministry spent 54,000,000 roubles for the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of primary instruction, while the Holy Synod spent 14,000,000 for the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> dependent upon it, a sum that is increased to 89,000,000 roubles by the contributions of other ministries or institutions. The primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> nevertheless are insufficient in number, and the progressive element in Russia calls for the establishment of 500,000 additional <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Russia has also professional <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>: an institute of forestry (<em>liesnoi institut</em>), attended by 460 students; 142 commercial institutes, with 2775 professors and 33,397 students; 87 commercial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with 1040 professors and 12,510 students; and 37 professional <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and institutes, with 717 professors and 4270 students.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> institutions, the Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg stands in the first place. It was instituted by Peter the Great in 1724, and was opened by Catherine I in 1726, and has various museums, <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>, laboratories, and observatories. Its literary activity is intense, its numerous scientific publications already forming a vast <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. There are also: the Imperial Arch&aelig;ographical Commission of St. Petersburg, famous for its splendid editions of Russian national chronicles; the Imperial Arch&aelig;ological Commission of St. Petersburg; the Imperial Arch&aelig;ological Society of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, which publishes learned and artistic volumes on the sacred and profane monuments of Russia; the Society of Oriental Studies, at St. Petersburg (<em>Vostotchnoviedienija Obshshestvo</em>), the scientific researches of which deal especially with Siberia and <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>; the Society of Naturalists of St. Petersburg (<em>Obshshestvo estestvoispytatelei</em>), which was founded in 1868; the Society of Geographical Studies (<em>Obshshestvo zemleviedienija</em>), established at St. Petersburg in 1903; the Imperial Institute of Experimental Medicine; the philologico-historical <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of Odessa and of Kharkoff; the Imperial Historical Society of St. Petersburg, which has published 130 volumes of historical documents and the Russian biographical lexicon; the Arch&aelig;ological, Historical, and Ethnological Society of Kazan; the Society of the Friends of Ancient Literature of St. Petersburg, which has published numerous and valuable copies of ancient texts; the Historical and Ancient Literature Society, connected with the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, whose <em>Tchtenija</em> (lectures) constitute the richest and most valuable historical collection of Russia; the Imperial Mineralogical Institute of St. Petersburg; the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> Society of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, which publishes the periodical "Slavianski Viek"; the Polytechnical Institute of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>; the Imperial Arch&aelig;ological Society of St. Petersburg, with classical, Oriental, Russo-Slavic, and <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatical</a> sections; the Imperial Geographical Society of St. Petersburg, famous for its publications; the Juridical Institute of St. Petersburg; the Lazareff Institute of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, famous for its learned publications on Oriental and other subjects. All of these institutions, to which many of secondary importance, existing in all Russian cities, are to be added, furnish a notable contribution to the activities of Russian <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, which in reality are very considerable. These institutions are also endowed with very fine <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>.

<p>The most important Russian <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> is the Imperial Public Library, which is divided into thirteen sections, and is rich in bibliographical treasures, among them the famous <a href="../cathen/04085a.htm">Codex Sinaiticus</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. The second is the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the Academy of Sciences, which is growing richer from year to year, and with which is connected the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> Museum of St. Petersburg, where there are many Oriental <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of value. Two famous <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> are: that of the Holy Synod, where there is a very large collection of Greek <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the Rumianzoff Museum. In the Caucasus there are: the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the Ecclesiastical Museum of Tiflis, which is rich in ancient Georgian <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Etchmiadzin, which has a valuable collection of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a>.
<h2>Economics and finance</h2>

<p>It was only towards the end of the nineteenth century that the budget began to free itself from its continuous fluctuations. In view of the disorder that obtained in its finances during that century, the Government was compelled continually to increase the compulsory acceptance of bank-notes which, from a total of 568 million roubles in 1857, increased to 1100 million roubles by 1883. To meet its <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>, it was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to resort to loans which, from 2537 million roubles in 1856, increased to 5424 million roubles in 1883. The Russian budget, both in receipts and in expenses, increases continually: the highest budgets, for receipts and for expenses, were those of 1905 (receipts, 2989 million roubles; expenses, 3194 million roubles); 1906 (receipts, 3423 million roubles; expenses, 3212 million roubles); and 1907 (receipts, 2195 million roubles; expenses, 2582 million roubles). The increased receipts are due to loans, and the increased expenses to the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. The expenses of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> from 1904 to 1909 amounted to 2,414,923,194 roubles. The budget that was submitted to the Duma and to the Council of the Empire for 1908 fixed the receipts at 2,478,677,241 roubles, and the expenditure at 2,631,495,495 roubles. That for 1909 fixed both the receipts and the expenditure at 2,595,049,000 roubles. Of the receipts 193,882,000 roubles are derived (Statute of 1909) from direct taxation; 523,758,000 from indirect taxation; 140,709,000 from the customs; 806,488,000 from the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the State (<em>regalii</em>); 685,670,000 from the properties and capitals of the State; and the remainder from other sources. Of the expenditure, 473,919,000 roubles are for the account of the Ministry of Marine; 393,363,000 roubles are absorbed by the payment of coupons of the Russian Rentes; 89,353,000 roubles are assigned to the Ministry of the Navy; 452,117,000 to the Ministry of Finance; 553,156,000 to the Ministry of Railways and Communications; 154,378,000 to the Ministry of the Interior; 63,937,000 to the Ministry of Public Instruction; 31,663,000 to the Holy Synod, and 71,488,000 to the Ministry of Justice. Among the direct taxes are those upon alcoholic liquors (34,172,000 roubles), upon tobacco (49,028,582 roubles), on sugar (75,541,747 roubles), and on petroleum (31,967,500 roubles). The monopoly of alcoholic drinks yields to the State the enormous sum of 542,288,341 roubles. The Government receives 36,500,000 roubles from the postal service, 21,500,000 roubles from the telegraphs, and 453,500,000 roubles from the railways. Russia has the largest budget in the world, but not in proportion to the number of its inhabitants.

<p>A great portion of the resources of Russia is absorbed by the interest on its <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>, which in 1907 amounted to 8,625,560,215 roubles. Of this sum, 3,155,641,839 roubles were on account of the railways. In 1908 the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> amounted to 8,725,523,210 roubles. During 1903-07, on account of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, the Russian <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> increased by a sum of 2,081,596,540 roubles. For the payment of its foreign Rentes, the Russian Government needs several hundred millions in gold, wherefore its financial policy tends to increase exportations, to favour home industries, and to augment the metallic supply. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 29 Aug., 1897, put gold into circulation in Russia; and that of 28 April, 1900, guaranteed the payment in gold of notes of credit. In 1908 the bank notes in circulation aggregated a sum of 1200 million roubles; and the gold 578,200,000 roubles, a decrease of 19,400,000 roubles from the preceding year. The principal establishment of credit in Russia is the state bank (<em>gosudarstvennyi bank</em>), which has 8 agencies and 107 branches. Its gold reserve in 1908 amounted to 1200 million roubles, in Russian and in foreign coin, and in bars. Its deposits in precious metals and in securities amounted to 8286 million roubles. In 1862 there were only 2 savings banks in Russia; in 1880 their number had increased to 76, and in 1890 to 1826; in 1900 to 5145, and in 1908 to 6710, with an aggregate of 6,210,238 depositors, and of 1,149,243,581 roubles of deposits. Other important banks are: the Agricultural Bank of the Nobility, the assets of which, on 1 Jan., 1909, amounted to 808,000,000 roubles; the Agricultural Bank of the peasants, which on the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> had assets of 1134 million roubles; the agricultural stock banks (<em>akcionernye zemel'nye banki</em>), which were established between 1871 and 1873 in the Governments of Kharkoff, Pultowa, St. Petersburg, Tula, Bessarabia, Taurida, Nizhni-Novgorod, Samara, Kieff, <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>, Yaroslaff, Kostroma, and the Province of the Don Cossacks, the aggregate assets of which, on 1 Jan., 1909, amounted to 1164 million roubles. The first mutual credit <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was established at St. Petersburg in 1864; at the present time there are 401 of them, 13 of which are at St. Petersburg. In 1909 there were 368 of these associations, with an aggregate of 208,914 members, and assets of 403 million roubles.

<p>Insurance <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> are of long standing in Russia. One of them, the Russian Fire Insurance Society, was established in 1827. In 1907 there were 13 fire insurance <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> in the empire, the aggregate receipts of which in 1907 amounted to 107,000,000 roubles, as compared with 99,000,000 in 1906, and 91,000,000 in 1905. The most important of these companies is the Salamandra, which was established in 1846. Life insurance policies are issued also by the State savings banks, which in 1907 issued 1653 policies for the total sum of 3,018,929 roubles. There are 7 Russian and 3 foreign life insurance companies, the first having a combined capital of 90,000,000 roubles, and the second 20,000,000 roubles. In 1907 there were 125 insurance <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> in operation in the various cities of Russia. After the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 2 July, 1903, which provided for indemnity to workmen in case of accident at work, nine accident insurance <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> appeared, at the industrial centres of Riga, Ivanovo, <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, Kieff, Odessa, St. Petersburg, Tchernomorna, and Bielostok. These <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> have a combined capital of 1,700,000 roubles, but the number of workers insured is small (290,775). Besides the establishments that have been mentioned above, there are in Russia 34 commercial banks, 407 mutual credit <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, and 86 pawn offices (<em>monts de pi&eacute;t&eacute;</em>). In all, there are 1502 institutions of credit in Russia.
<h2>Morality: statistics of crime</h2>

<p>Statistics show a continual increase of criminality in Russia, due to the increase of the population, the dissemination of socialistic and of revolutionary <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> among the lower classes, the want of culture, and the lack of moral influence of the Orthodox religion. From a total of 266,261 crimes punished by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in 1901, the figures increased to 271,360 in 1902; 292,907 in 1903; 299,968 in 1904, and 351,710 in 1905. Thefts and crimes against the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> represent the greatest number of these crimes. The number of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">homicides</a> increased considerably in 1905-07, and likewise offences by the Press. In 1905 there were 141,847 arrests (129,275 men). In the same year 3622 men and 720 <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were condemned for <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">homicide</a>. The highest percentage of criminals is furnished by the peasants. In 1906 there were 111,403 arrests; in 1907, 138,501; and to 1 Jan., 1908, 160,025. In 1907 there were 903 <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a>. Criminality has assumed great proportions, especially in the Caucasus and <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, where, on account of political as well as of <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> causes, outlawry has increased its numbers to a considerable extent. Political criminality has increased there to an alarming degree. In <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> in 1904-06 760 civil, military, and police employees died by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and 864 were wounded; 142 suffered from the explosion of bombs. In Warsaw alone, from 1904 to 1907, 236 police were killed, 179 of them in 1906. The Russian Government has answered these assaults by a multiplication of death sentences, the number of which from 1905 to the present time amounts to several thousand.
<h2>History</h2>
<h3 id="A">The epoch of the princes</h3>

<p>Nestor, the Russian chronicler, speaks of the Drevliani, Radimitchi, Viatitchi, Severiani, and of the primitive races of Russia as of beasts, and assails their <a href="../cathen/02564a.htm">polygamy</a>, indecency, and the roughness of their ways. A few <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> would collect to form a village, and a few villages would constitute a <em>voolst</em> governed by a prince; their attempts at cities were few and far between, and the little states, devoid of a central Government, were the prey of internal discord, and too weak to resist the attacks of external enemies. The <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> of the south were tributaries of the Khazari; and according to Nestor, those of the Ilmen, torn by dissensions, sent messengers to the Vareghi, or Variaghi, inviting the latter to the country of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> of the Ilmen, which was a land of plenty, but devoid of order and of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Russian historians do not agree upon the ethnological relations of the Vareghi, who, according to some authorities, were Scandinavians, and according to others, <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>; while yet others regard them as adventurers made up of both of those races; more frequently however they are recognized as Normans. Be that as it may, the Vareghi accepted the invitation to establish themselves in the country of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> of the Ilmen, and opened the era of the national history of Russia &mdash; of the Russia of the heroic period; and the region of Kieff, according to ancient chronicles, received the name of <em>Russ</em>.

<p>The first to establish themselves in the territory of the Russian tribes were the three Vareghian brothers, Rurik, Sineus, and Truvor, who came with their <em>druzhine</em>, or bands of warriors. Rurik pitched his tents on the shores of Lake Ladoga; Sineus on the shores of the White Sea; while Truvor established himself at Isborsk. After the deaths of Sineus and Truvor, Rurik took up his abode at Novgorod, where he built a castle. Two other Vareghians, Askold and Dir, installed themselves at Kieff, and reigned over the Poliani; with their fleets of small vessels, they crossed the Bosphorus and attacked Constantinople, which city, according to the Byzantine chroniclers, owed its safety on this occasion to the intercession of Our Lady of the Blachern&aelig;. Rurik was succeeded by Oleg, who treacherously <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> Askold and Dir, made himself master of Kieff, to which he gave the name of Mother of Russian Cities, collected a great fleet in 906 to attack Byzantium, and died in the height of his glory, leaving the kingdom to a son of Rurik, Igor. The latter turned his arms unsuccessfully against Byzantium, and died the victim of a barbarous assassination at the hands of the Drevliani in 945. The <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Igor, Queen Olga, assumed the regency in the minority of her son Sviatoslaff, and cruelly punished the Drevliani for their crimes.

<p>Under Prince Sviatoslaff (964-72), the Khazari were completely defeated, the Petcheneghi put the city of Kieff in danger of destruction, and the Russians, after an heroic resistance, were defeated at Silistria by the Byzantine army under Joannes I Zimiskes. On his return to Russia the Petcheneghi prepared an ambuscade for Sviatoslaff, and killed him and the survivors of his defeated army. The kingdom of Sviatoslaff was inherited by his sons Jaropolk, Oleg, and Vladimir. Jaropolk, who received the Province of Kieff, killed Oleg, who reigned over the Drevliani, and in turn was killed by Vladimir, who had inherited the Province of Novgorod. Before his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, this prince gave himself up to the most unbridled dissipation. Fortunate in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, he fought successfully against the Poles, the Viatitch, the Radimitchi, the Letts, and the Petcheneghi, and owing to his military successes became the hero of Russian popular songs. His reign lasted from 972 to 1015. Upon the death of Vladimir, his dominions were divided among many heirs, and there were consequent disputes and civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. Two of the sons of Vladimir, the princes Boris and Gliebe, were assassinated by Sviatopolk, Prince of Turoff. Yaroslaff, Prince of Novgorod, another son of Vladimir, succeeded in avenging the death of his innocent brothers, and driving Sviatopolk from his throne, he united all Russia under his own sceptre and established his seat of government at Kieff. His reign was long and glorious. He inflicted terrible defeats upon the Petcheneghi, the Lithuanians, and the Finnish tribes, but sought in vain to take Constantinople. His far-sighted policy led him to seek intermarriages with the Kings of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. Kieff (adorned with its splendid Cathedral of St. Sophia) became the artistic and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> centre of Russia.

<p>From 1054, however, the political conditions of Russia went from bad to worse, and the want of political unity remained a constant cause of internal weakness. In less than two centuries, according to Pogodin, there were sixty-four independent principalities, 293 princes, and 83 civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, to which must be added the continual incursions of the barbarians. The history of Russia during this period is a mass of discordant notices. The chief principalities of that time were Smolensk, Tehernigoff, Northern Novgorod, Ryazan, Murom, Tver, Suzdal, Rostoff, Vladimir, Yaroslaff, Pereiaslaff-Zalieski, Volhynia, Galicia, and others; and these states, upon the death of each of their respective princes, were subdivided into new fiefs. Yaroslaff was succeeded upon the throne of Kieff by his son Iziaslaff, who died in 1078. The son of Iziaslaff, Sviatopolk reigned from 1093 to 1113, during which period questions of the succession to the Principalities of Tchernigoff and Volhynia brought the horrors of civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon Russia. Sviatopolk was succeeded by the prudent Vladimir Monomacus (1113-25), who obtained important victories over the Polovey, Petcheneghi, and Tcherkessi. When he died he left as his testament to his sons an instruction, which is to some extent an autobiography, and which contains wise advice for government. His sons and his grandsons, however, did not profit by it, for their rivalry contributed to the decadence of Kieff, which in 1169 was besieged and taken by the armies of Rostoff, Vladimir, and Suzdal, commanded by Mstislav, son of Andrew Bogoljubski. The city was sacked and its <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> profaned. In 1203 it was again sacked by the Polovcy, and Kieff ceased to be the political centre of Russia.

<p>After the fall of Kieff, the Principalities of Suzdal, Galicia, Novgorod, and Pskof had a rapid but ephemeral development. The most famous of the princes of Suzdal was Andrew Bogoljubski (1157-74), who owed his fame to his <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>, his military enterprises, his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a>, and his attachment to the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>. The city of Vladimir owes to him the splendid monuments that place it in the front rank of the cities of Russia from an arch&aelig;ological standpoint. Autocracy found in him its staunchest supporter, which, however, cost him his life, for he was assassinated by the <em>boyars</em> at Bogoljubovo, where he had built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. His death was followed by turbulence, caused by the rivalry of the cities of Rostoff, Suzdal, and Vladimir, the last of which was victorious, and developed its power still more under Prince Vsevolod (1176-1212). Further <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of succession led in 1215 to the terrible battle of Lipetsk, in which the troops of Novgorod, Pskof, and Smolensk massacred the army of Suzdal and Murom. Their prince, George II, at the death of his brother Constantine, Prince of Vladimir, fought furiously against the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> of the Volga, and in 1220, at the confluence of the Oka with the Volga, laid the foundation of Nizhni-Novgorod.

<p>In Galicia, Romano, Prince of Volhynia (1188-1205), assisted by the Poles, established himself at Galitch, became famous through his cruelty and his military enterprises, and died in battle against the Poles. He was succeeded by his son Daniel (1205-1266); this prince allowed the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> to enter his dominions, and thereby greatly promoted industry and commerce. During this period the free cities of Novgorod, Pskof, and Vyatka, like the Italian republics of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, reached a high degree of splendour, and of <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> and artistic development; but, torn by internal dissensions, their power waned, while the power of the German <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military order</a>, of the Brothers of the Militia of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or Sword-Bearers, and that of the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a> increased; these two orders were formed into a single <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> in 1237, and subjected the Letts, the Livonians, and the Finns to their influence.
<h3 id="B">Russia under the Tatars</h3>

<p>After uniting all the Tatar tribes under his sceptre, Jenghiz Khan (1154-1227) extended his conquest to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, <a href="../cathen/15095a.htm">Turkestan</a>, Great Bokhara, and the plains of Western <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> as far as the Crimea; and his successors, continuing the advance, with their hordes crossed the steppes of Southern Russia, and reached the frontiers of the Polovcy; these turned to the Russian princes for assistance. The latter responded to that appeal, and met the <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> hordes (1224) at the Kalka, a rivulet that flows into the Sea of Azoff. The princes Mstislav the Rash, Daniel of Galitch, and Oleg of Kursk performed prodigies of valour at the head of their troops; but the numerical superiority of the Tatars and the cowardice of the Polovcy brought defeat upon the Russians, costing them the lives of six princes and seventy boyars. In 1237, led by Baty, the Tatars returned to Russia, burned and destroyed the capital of the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> in the region of the Volga, and assailed Ryazan, whose princes opposed a desperate resistance, without however being able to save the city from pillage and ruin. Having secured the possession of Ryazan, the Tatars invaded the Principality of Suzdal (1238), and burned Suzdal, Rostoff, Yaroslaff, and many other cities and villages. The Prince of Suzdal, George II, died on the battlefield. In 1239-40, the Tatars continued their devastations through Southern Russia, took Pereiaslaff, Tchernigoff, and Kieff, sowed death and ruin broadcast, and entered Volhynia and Galicia, Novgorod alone escaping the fate of the other Russian cities. In the region of the lower course of the Volga, Baty established his residence (<em>Sarai</em>, the castle), which became the capital of a great Tatar empire, called the Kingdom of the Golden Horde, extending from the Urals and the Caspian Sea to the mouth of the Danube. About 1272 the Tatars of Russia embraced <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>, became its fanatical preachers, and on this account refrained from mixing with the Russians. At the death of George II his dominions, devastated and pillaged, were inherited by Yaroslaff (1238-46), who was forced to traverse the whole of Russia and <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> to pay homage to the Grand Khan of the Tatars, Oktai. He died of want in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and was succeeded by his son Alexander Nevski, whose name is famous in the national history of Russia on account of his victories over the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a>, the Swedes, and the Finns (1246-52).

<p>Following a policy of toleration the very opposite of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> policy towards <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> peoples, the Tatars respected the dynasties and the political institutions of the Russian principalities. Suzdal, Galicia, Volhynia, Tchernigoff, Polotsk, and Novgorod continued to live and to govern themselves as in the past. The Russians were not tatarized, chiefly because differences of religion raised insurmountable barriers between them and the Tatars. The khans of the Golden Horde limited themselves to requiring the external homage of the Russian princes, to acting as arbiters in their quarrels, to imposing a poll-tax, to exacting a military contingent, to reserving the right of investiture over them, and to forbidding them to carry on <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> without permission. This subjection of the Russians to the Tatars exercised a great influence on Russia. For several centuries the Russians had no contact with Western civilization, and were subjected more directly to the weakening influence of the Byzantine civilization. In their military, <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a>, and political organization the Russians adopted a great many Tartar institutions. The autocratic government of the Tatar helped to consolidate the autocracy of the Russian princes, which was derived from Byzantium. The Orthodox Russian Church grew in power under the rule of the Tatars, on account of the privileges and exemptions accorded to it. Monasteries were multiplied throughout Russia and through the donations of the faithful acquired enormous riches. On the other hand, there are Russian writers who believe that they discern Tatar influence in the condition of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in Russia.

<p>Besides the Tatars, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the Russians had to struggle in the western provinces against the aggressive <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> of the Lithuanians, the political union of which people had been established by Prince Mindvog, assassinated in 1263. The territorial expansion of the Lithuanians reached its culmination under Prince Gedimin (1315-40), who extended his conquests to Southern Russia, and subjected to his rule Grodno, Pinsk, Brest, Polotsk, Tchernigoff, Vladimir, and finally Kieff, which had entirely lost its prestige. At his death, his son Olgerd (1345-77) led his victorious armies into the territory of Novgorod, adding to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> conquests Vitebsk, <a href="../cathen/10428a.htm">Mohileff</a>, Bryansk, northern Novgorod, Kamenetz, and Podolia, and reached the shores of the Black Sea. He would have established his power at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> also, if the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a> and the Poles had not opposed his ambitious projects. His successor Jagellon (1377-1434) married Hedwig, Queen of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, converted the Lithuanians to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and established his capital at Cracow. But the conversion of the Lithuanians displeased the obstinate <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> and the members of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, and these two united under the flag of Vitovt (1392-1430), upon whom Jagellon was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to confer the title of Grand Prince of Lithuania. Vitovt, like his predecessors, continued his conquests in Russia, and took and pillaged Smolensk. He also conceived the design of bringing the Tartar domination to an end, and in 1399 at the head of an enormous army of <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuanians</a>, Poles, and Russians, he gave battle to the Tatars, who routed him completely. Vitovt, however, was not disheartened. In 1410 with a large army of Poles and Lithuanians, to which 40,000 Tartars and 20,000 mercenaries were added, he assailed the army of the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a> at Tannenberg, and, notwithstanding their desperate efforts, destroyed their power, while they left the flower of their order on the battlefield.
<h3 id="C">The principality and the grand princes of Moscow</h3>

<p>The name of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> appears for the first time in Russian chronicles in 1147. Its founder is said to have been Prince George Dolgoruki, who raised it from a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> village to a city that was destined to become the heart of the great Russian empire. In 1237 it was burned by the Tatars; but having arisen again under Prince George Danilovitch (1303-26), it began its political development. The means adopted for their aggrandizement are certainly not creditable to the princes of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, who according to Rambaud, used intrigue, corruption, the purchase of consciences, servility toward the Tatars, assassination, and delation. George Danilovitch used the Tartars to destroy the power of the princes of Tver. He was assassinated in 1325 by Prince Demetrius of Tver, and Was succeeded by Ivan Kalita, who turned his efforts to transforming <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> into the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of Russia; he built the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of the Assumption (<em>Uspenski Sobor</em>) within the enclosure of the Kremlin; and he destroyed the power of the princely dynasty of Tver. His two sons, Simon the Superb (1340-53) and Ivan the Good-Natured (1353-59), continued the policy of their father, the former holding the Russian princes in submission and taking the title of Grand Prince of all the Russians; and the latter showing himself gentle towards his rivals and towards the Lithuanians when they attempted to encroach upon his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>; he was supported by faithful and intelligent men, among them the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> Alexis, who preserved the throne for Demetrius Ivanovitch, son of Ivan. Demetrius Ivanovitch made the first decisive step towards liberating Russia from the Tartar yoke. After carrying on <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the princes of Suzdal, of Tver, and of Ryazan, he crossed the Don, with a large army and the contingents of many Russian princes subject to him, and on the plain of Kulikovo inflicted a bloody defeat upon Mama&iuml;, Khan of the Golden Horde, who had led against the Russians an immense multitude of Tatars, <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, Polovcy, Tcherkeesi, etc. His victory won him the epithet of <em>Donskoi</em>, but his success was not lasting, for the Tatars, assisted by Tokhtamitch, one of the generals of Timur, laid waste <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, Vladimir Mozhaisk, and Yurieff.

<p>At the death of Demetrius the Grand Principality of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> and Vladimir was inherited by Vassili-Dmitrievitch (1389-1425), was extended by new conquests in the territory of Tchernigoff, Vyatka, and Novgorod, and thereafter consolidated more and more its supremacy over the Tatars, whose empire was wasting away in consequence of internal quarrels. During the reign of his successor, Vasili the Blind (1425-62), a civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> that lasted twenty years desolated the Grand Principality of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, the political development of which was thereby arrested. Nevertheless Muscovite supremacy was established over Novgorod and Ryazan. From 1449 Vasili had associated with himself in the government his son Ivan who was destined to acquire the epithets of "Great" and "Consolidator of Russia". Ivan the Great (1402-1505) found the territory that he inherited at the death of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> surrounded by the Tatar conquests, the Lithuanian Empire, and Sweden. Among the first events of his reign should be mentioned the complete submission of Novgorod to his rule: the ancient and free city retained only the name of republic; in 1495 Ivan destroyed its commerce also, and reduced it to the status of a city of his dominions. At the same time Russian armies were penetrating the north of Russia, conquering the Province of Perm and the city of Vyatka, marching to the shores of the Petchora, and reaching the coast of the White Sea. The Principality of Tver was annexed to that of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, as were also the cities of Bielozersk, Dmitroff, Mozhaisk, and Serpukhoff. The political unity of Russia was being consolidated in proportion as the Tatar empire of the Golden Horde crumbled. In 1480 two great armies of Russians and Tatars almost decided the fate of Russia in open battle. In 1487 the troops of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> entered the Tatar city of Kazan, and took its king, Alegam, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> to <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>. Kazan, however, did not become Russian territory, for Ivan the Great rightly feared that a general uprising of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> Tatars would follow if he annexed it.

<p>From 1492 Ivan turned his arms against Lithuania. The Lithuanians were supported by the Poles, the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> Tatars; but many princes among the vassals of the Grand Prince of Lithuania passed to the side of the Muscovites. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was prolonged for many years, until a truce was brought about by the mediation of <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Pope Alexander VI</a> and the King of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> in 1503. The most important event of the reign of Ivan the Great was his marriage to Sophia Pal&aelig;ologus, daughter of Thomas Pal&aelig;ologus, a brother of the last Emperor of Byzantium. This marriage was concluded by <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a> and <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Cardinal Bessarion</a>, and served as the pretext for the tsars to declare themselves heirs of the Byzantine <em>basileis</em>, to take as their arms the two-headed eagle, and to assume the r&ocirc;le of defenders and champions of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>. With Sophia Pal&aelig;ologus there went to <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> the surviving representatives of Byzantine culture, and some Italian artists, among whom were the famous architects Aristotele Fioravanti and Pietro Antonio. Ivan the Great then entered into relations with <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. Through the Princess Sophia, <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> flourished for a period at the court of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>.

<p>Under Basil Ivanovitch (1505-33), Muscovite Russia grew by the annexation of the Republic of Pskof, the Principalities of Ryazan and Novgorod-Seversk, and the Territory of Smolensk. The political prestige of Russia increased in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and Basil Ivanovitch had diplomatic relations with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkey</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. The court of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> displayed <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> luxury in its feasts. The Tatars, who had again invaded Russian territory, and had reached the walls of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, were met by new campaigns against Kazan (1523 and 1524), which, however, were not successful. In 1533 Ivan IV, a son of Basil, ascended the throne. Posterity has given to him the name of "Terrible" on account of his cruelty, although noted Russian historians like Soloveff and Zabielin have sought to clear his memory and to proclaim his great services to Russia. After freeing himself from the tutelage of the <em>boyars</em>, who lorded it according to their pleasure, in 1547 as heir of the House of Pal&aelig;ologus he caused himself to be <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> as Tsar of all the Russias, conquered Kazan (1552), and Astrakhan (1556), subjugated the Tchermisi, Mordvy, Tchiuvashi, Votiaki, Bashkiri, and Nogais; he fought with varied fortunes against the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a> in Livonia and against the Poles, and through the daring exploits of Gregory Strogonoff and of the Cossack Irmak Timotheevitch he conquered Siberia. He had the misfortune of seeing his capital burned by the Tatar Khan Devlet Ghirei, and of killing his eldest son Ivan in one of his violent excesses of rage. He died in 1584 and was succeeded by his son Feodor (1584-98), who was born the son of Ivan and Anastasia Romanoff. He married Irene, sister of Boris Godunoff, who coveted the throne, and who became the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> tsar in the reign of Feodor. The young prince Demetrius, son of the seventh wife of Ivan the Terrible, was relegated to the city of Uglitch. To the advice of Boris Godunoff also were due the two most important measures of this reign, the institution of serfdom, and of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>.

<p>To satisfy his thirst for power, Godunoff had the young brother of Feodor, the Tsarevitch Demetrius, and his relations <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, and made the city of Uglitch pay for having given them hospitality. At the death of Feodor, Boris Godunoff, whose name was to be immortalized by the beautiful tragedy of Pushkin, placed the crown of the tsars upon his own head. He worked to introduce Western civilization into <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, and died in 1605. He wished to leave the crown to his son, Feodor Borisovitch; in 1603 however a man, whose identity is still shrouded in mystery, had presented himself to the court and to the Polish nobility as the son of Ivan the Terrible, the young Demetrius whom Boris Godunoff had attempted to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, but whom his relatives had saved. With the aid of the Polish nobility, Demetrius, known to posterity as Pseudo-Demetrius, succeeded in entering <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, where Feodor Borisovitch and his mother paid with their lives for the short reign of Boris Godunoff. But a year later Demetrius died, the victim of a conspiracy, at the head of which was Prince Vasili Shuiski, who then ascended the throne of the tsars.

<p>Russia then entered upon a period of troubles (<em>smutnoe vremia</em>) that nearly brought about its political dissolution. New <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> Demetriuses appeared. The serfs and the peasants, led by Bolotnikoff, menaced <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>. The nobles wished to drive the usurper Vasili from the throne. The Poles fomented troubles, and sought to establish their supremacy at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>. A Polish army under the orders of the <em>waywode</em> John Sapieha and of Lissowski for sixteen months besieged the shrine of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> and St. Sergius, forty miles from <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> defended themselves so resolutely that they compelled the enemy to raise the siege. Tsar Vasili Shuiski called the Swedes to his assistance, but the King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, Sigismund III, casting aside all pretence, entered upon the conquest of Russia. The inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> revolted, and compelled Shuiski to abdicate (1610). Menaced from many quarters, they elected Vladislaff, son of Sigismund, to be their tsar, on condition that he would adopt the Orthodox religion. The Polish troops, commanded by the <em>hetman</em> Tolkiewski, entered <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>. But soon a popular revolt that cost thousands of lives <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> the Polish army to shut itself up in the Kremlin and to set fire to the capital. Sigismund was victorious: Smolensk, after a heroic defence, fell into his hands, and the Tsar Vasili Shuiski died at <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>. Russia seemed destined to disappear as a political entity. The people, however, saved her: a butcher of Nizhni-Novgorod instigated his fellow-citizens to give their wealth and their sons to free their country from the foreigner; and the Russian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were ardent supporters of this struggle for the defence of Russian <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> and of the power of the tsars. A Russian army was formed at Yaroslaff, and under the command of Prince Demetrius Pozharski marched against <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, where the Polish troops, decimated by hunger, capitulated at the moment when Sigismund was drawing near with an army to assist them (1612). A great national assembly convened at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, and elected Michael Romanoff tsar. He was a son of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> Filarete, who was held a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> at Marienburg by the Poles.

<p>Under the new tsar (1613-45), Russia strove to heal its wounds. With Sweden in 1617 the peace of Stolbovo was concluded; but the Poles continued their hostilities, and Vladislaff was ready to march on <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>. In 1618 however a truce was concluded. Filarete then returned to <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, where he became the counsellor of his son, and was associated with him in the empire. At the death of Sigismund III (1632), Vladislaff, having ascended the throne of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> as Wladislaw IV, took up arms against Russia once more. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, which was fought with varied fortunes, terminated in the truce of Deulin, by the terms of which Wladislaw recognized Michael Romanoff as tsar. The successor of Michael was Alexis Mikhailovitch (1645-76). His first action was directed against <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, which, by its political and religious <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the Orthodox of Little Russia, had lost the good will of the Cossacks and of the lower classes. A Cossack leader, Bogdan Khelmnicki, raised the banner of revolt, and after several battles the tsar also took up arms in 1654. The Russian armies marched against the Poles, and in a short time invaded the whole of Little Russia and Lithuania. A treaty of peace which was concluded in 1667 made Russia mistress of Kieff, Smolensk, and the right bank of the Dnieper, but re-established Polish rule in <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a>. This peace was made <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> by the Cossacks, who, unwilling to submit to authority, menaced the interior tranquillity of Russia. One of them, Stenko Razin, put himself at the head of a large band of Cossacks of the Don, passed to the region of the Volga, caused peasants, Tatars, Tchiuvashi, Mordvy, and Tchermisi to revolt, and desolated eastern Russia. His hordes were routed by George Bariatinski near Simbirsk, and he was decapitated at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> in 1670. Under the Tsar Feodor Alexievitch (1672-82) the Ukraine and the territory of the Zaporoghi Cossacks definitively became Russian possessions, by the treaty of 1681 with Turkey.
<h3 id="D">Reforms of Peter the Great</h3>

<p>Modern Russia and its political greatness as a <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> state really begin with Peter the Great. Without him Russia would probably have remained an <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> power. Peter I the Great was the son of Alexis Mikhailovitch and his second wife Natalia Naryshkin. He was proclaimed tsar at the age of nine years, and his youth was threatened by the gravest perils. The ambitious Sophia, daughter of Alexis Mikhailovitch and his first wife, Maria Miloslavska, taking advantage of the minority of Peter, succeeded, by intrigue and cunning beyond her age, in holding the regency of the empire for seven years (1682-89), until she was driven from the throne and locked up in the Devici <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, while her favourites and partisans died on the scaffold or in exile. Sole and absolute sovereign, Peter the Great wished to begin his reign with some great victory. Accordingly, he rapidly built a fleet, with which he compelled the capitulation of Azoff in 1696. This splendid success gave him great prestige. In 1697 he undertook a journey to Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, where he visited <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, becoming a mechanic, visiting industrial establishments, and taking workmen and engineers into his employ, while at the same time he busied himself with politics. This voyage to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> had disastrous effects upon internal order in Russia, for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the lower classes, with <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> terror, believed that it would establish foreign influence in Russia, that is to say, would destroy the ancient religious customs of the land. The lower classes considered it sacrilegious to shave off the <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a>, just as the <em><a href="../cathen/12648b.htm">raskolniki</a></em>, who were very numerous, regarded it as a crime to use tobacco. Both of these customs Peter the Great had brought to Russia; reports were spread that he was not of royal birth, but was the child of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and that he was the <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> who was to be born in those times. Peter the Great returned to <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, and quenched the revolution in blood, causing a thousand people to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> amid tortures in a single week, and not hesitating to wield the axe himself to decapitate rebels. Two other military revolts, that of the Don Cossacks (1706) and the Cossacks of the Ukraine, which was brought about by the <em>hetman</em> Mazeppa, who had allied himself to Charles XII of Sweden, were crushed by Peter's generals.

<p>The conquest of the Baltic led Peter the Great to make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on Sweden. The Russian troops were defeated in 1700 under the walls of Narva; but in. 1701 Prince Seremeteff inflicted a severe defeat upon the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> general Slipenbach, near Ehresfer, and a more severe one in 1702 near H&uuml;mmelsdorf, after which he took the fortress of Nienschantz which the Swedes had built at the mouth of the Neva. Narva fell into the hands of Peter the Great in 1704. In 1708 Charles XII of Sweden invaded Russia at the head of an army of 43,000 veterans, and took the way to <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> through Lithuania; but a most severe winter and the want of provisions decimated his troops. On 8 July, 1709, under the walls of Pultowa, a Russian army of 60,000 men attacked the Swedes, who were reduced to extremes by hunger and sickness. Both sides fought heroically, but the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> army was destroyed and Charles XII was compelled to seek refuge in Turkey. By this victory, which has remained famous in history, Russia raised her flag on the shores of the Baltic, while Sweden fell from the rank of a great <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> power.

<p>Crowned with the halo of victory, Peter the Great displayed greater energy in his purpose to combine Western civilization with the ancient Russian life, preserving however those Russian customs that seemed to him to be useful to his empire. For example, the serfdom of the agricultural classes was sanctioned by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and all the peasants were bound to fixed residence and to <em>per capita</em> taxation. The inhabitants of the cities were divided into guilds, according to trades or professions; foreigners were authorized to carry on commerce and to devote themselves to the industries in Russia; <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were taken from their isolation and from the retirement of the <em>terem</em>; he instituted the directing senate to take the place of the ancient <em>duma</em> of the <em>boyars</em>; the provincial administration was reorganized; many abuses of the bureaucracy were rooted out; the army received a <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> organization, and was increased to 210,000 men; the ancient organization of the Russian Church was destroyed by the institution of the Holy Synod; religious tolerance was established; commerce and industry were developed; a great number of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and printing-houses were founded; and at the mouth of the Neva he built his capital, St. Petersburg, the "window opened towards the West"; the head of Russia, as <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> is its heart. And in order to reduce so many reforms to practice in the face of the hostility, sometimes open, sometimes covert, of his subjects, Peter the Great used all the resources of his iron will, all the arms that autocracy placed in his hands, not excluding <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and cruelty.

<p>The work of these reforms did not take the mind of the great reformer from his military enterprises. In 1711 he crossed the Dniester at the head of 30,000 men, bent on the conquest of Constantinople; but an army of 200,000 <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and Tatars on the banks of the Pruth compelled him to abandon his ambitious dream and to restore Azoff to Turkey. In 1713 the Russian fleet, under the direction of Admiral Apraxin and of Peter the Great himself, took possession of Helsingfors and Abo in <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a>, and drew near to Stockholm. After a pause of a few years, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with Sweden was renewed in 1719 and continued until the peace of Nystad put an end to it in 1721, securing to Russia the possession of Livonia, Esthonia, Ingermanland, a part of <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a>, and a part of Karelia. In the following year Russian troops marched to the frontier of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, invaded Daghestan, Ghilan, and Mazandaran, and took possession of Derbent.

<p>But the military and political successes of Peter the Great were embittered by domestic tragedies. His first wife, Eudocia Lapukhina, was opposed to the reforms, and was therefore compelled to lock herself up in the Pokrovski <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Suzdal. The son of Eudocia, Alexis, held to his mother's <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> reforms. He left Russia while Peter the Great was travelling in the West, and sought refuge at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. Having been discovered, he returned to St. Petersburg, where his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> subjected him to torture, and thereby discovered that Alexis and his mother were the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a conspiracy to destroy Peter's work. Eudocia was beaten with rods; the counsellors and partisans of Alexis died amid the most dreadful sufferings; and Alexis himself, having been subjected to torture several times, died in consequence, or was executed, in 1718. By his ukase in 1723, Peter the Great declared Catherine empress. She was a native of Livonia who, after being the mistress of Sheremeteff and Menshikoff, had become the mistress of Peter, who had married her in 1712. The great reformer died in 1725. However historians may differ in their opinions of him, Peter was certainly the founder of modern Russia.
<h3 id="E">The successors of Peter the Great</h3>

<p>The brief reigns of Catherine I (1725-27) and of Peter II Alexeievitch, son of Alexis and Charlotte of Brunswick, offer nothing of interest, except the struggle for political influence between the Menshikoffs and the Dolgorukis. At the death of Peter II, Anna Ivanovna, Duchess of Courland, became Empress of Russia, and an attempt by the aristocracy to establish a supreme council to limit the autocratic power cost the lives of its authors, among whom were several of the Dolgoruki. The empress surrounded herself with Germans; and among them, a Courlander of low extraction, named Biren, became very influential. On his account the reign of Anna Ivanovna received the name of <em>Bironovshshina</em>. Very many nobles paid with their lives for the antipathy they felt towards the new regime, and measures of public finance reduced the peasants to extreme poverty, while Anna indulged in unheard-of luxury, and her court distinguished itself for its immorality and dissipation. At the death of Anna in 1740 the regency passed to Anna Leopoldovna of Mecklenburg, who continued the German regime and gave to Elizabeth, daughter of Peter the Great, timely occasion to drive her from the throne and to imprison her with her husband and her children at Kholmogory, while Elizabeth proclaimed herself Empress of all the Russias. Elizabeth Petrovna (1756-1762), notwithstanding her dissolute habits, continued the traditions of her father: the senate was re-established; industry was developed; great impulse was given to commerce; the severity of corporal punishment was mitigated; the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> was established; St. Petersburg was embellished with splendid buildings designed by the Italian architect Rastrelli; the Academy of Sciences, founded by Peter the Great and Catherine I, began its period of fruitful literary work; while the Russian armies conquered southern Finland and weakened the power of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, which suffered the disasters of Grossj&auml;gernsdorf (1757) and Kunersdorf (1759). In 1760 the armies of Elizabeth made their triumphal entrance into <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>.

<p>Elizabeth was succeeded by Peter III, a son of Anna Petrovna and Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein. His reign was very short, for his ambitious consort, Princess Sophia of Anhalt-Zerbst, who became celebrated under the name of Catherine II, compelled him to abdicate, leaving her to reign alone in 1762. The first great events of her government were the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and the partition of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. Against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, Catherine sent Prince Galitzin, who in 1769 near Chotin defeated a <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> army three times larger than his own. In the following year (1770), Rumiantzeff obtained a still more decisive victory at Kagul, where with 17,000 Russians he defeated a <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> army of 150,000 men. In 1771 Prince Dolgoruki took possession of the whole of the Crimea, from which he drove the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. At the same time, the Russian Baltic fleet annihilated the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> fleet in the roads of <a href="../cathen/03689b.htm">Chios</a> and in the port of Tchesme. Hostilities were resumed in 1772, and culminated in the treaty of Kutchuk-Kainardii (1774), by which the independence of the Tatars of the Crimea was recognized, while Azoff, Kinburn, and the strongholds of the peninsula were ceded to Russia, which received a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> indemnity of 4,500,000 roubles. The treaty of 15 Jan., 1772, between Russia and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> sanctioned the iniquitous division of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, which was desired by <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> and was hastened by the policy of the Polish nobility and, to a great extent, of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. By this division Russia added to her dominions White Russia (Polotsk, Vitebsk, Orsha, <a href="../cathen/10428a.htm">Mohileff</a>, Mstislavl, and Gomel), with 1,600,000 inhabitants; <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> received eastern Galicia and Ruthenia (or Red Russia), with 2,500,000 inhabitants; and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> received the provinces of western <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> (except Thorn and Danzig), with 900,000 inhabitants.

<p>To these victories and conquests Catherine added her efforts to give to Russia a good internal government: she established a commission, a species of national representation of the different peoples of Russia, to frame a new code of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> (1766-68); she suppressed the revolt of Emilius Pugatcheff, a <a href="../cathen/12648b.htm">Raskolnik</a> Cossack, who, pretending to be Peter III, escaped from his butchers, carried fire and sword through the region of the Volga, stirred the serfs and the Cossacks to revolt, and massacred many nobles (1773); by a ukase in 1775 she divided Russia into fifty governments, and the governments into districts; she reorganized the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and established a better apportionment of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges of the various social classes; she secularized the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and founded at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> the <em>Vospitatelnyi dom</em> for <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, gave efficient aid to the literary movement of her age, and became famous also as a writer; she corresponded with learned <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> (especially with the French Encyclop&aelig;dists), promoted the arts, and enriched the museums. Meanwhile skilful generals, among whom was Catherine's favourite, Potemkin, added new glories to the military history of Russia. Gustavus III of Sweden, notwithstanding the naval victory of Svenska-Sund (9 July, 1790), was unable to take land from Russia. Rumiantzeff, Potemkin, Suvaroff, and Soltikoff, one after another, defeated the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> armies, took Otchakoff and Ismail by assault, and compelled Turkey, at the Peace of <a href="../cathen/08325b.htm">Jassy</a> (1792), to make new cessions of territory (Otchakoff and the coast between the Bug and the Dnieper) and to grant independence to the principalities of the Danube.

<p>Under Catherine II there took place the third Partition of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, which the heroism of <a href="../cathen/08694a.htm">Kosciuszko</a> was not able to avert. By this partition Russia added Volhynia, Podolia, Little Russia, and the remainder of <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a> to her empire (1795). Catherine died 17 Nov., 1796, at the age of 67 years. Thanks to her policy and to the victories of her generals she had greatly increased the territory of Russia, extending its frontiers to the Niemen, the Dniester, and the Black Sea. Paul I (1796-1801) at first followed a policy of peace; he introduced wise <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> reforms, and re-established the principle of succession to the throne in the male line. But the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> compelled him to enter an alliance with Turkey, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> against <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The Russian troops, under the orders of Rimsky-Korsakoff, entered <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and under Suvaroff they marched into upper <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The campaign was not a successful one for the Russians, but their retreat under Suvaroff through the Alps, where they were shut in by the French armies (1799), has remained famous. Paul I was assassinated by a palace conspiracy on the night of 23-24 March, 1801, and Alexander I (1801-25) ascended the throne. The new emperor took part in the epic struggle of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> against <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>. On 2 Dec., 1805, was fought the battle of Austerlitz, which cost Russia the flower of her army and very nearly the life of Alexander himself. On 6 Feb., 1807, at Eylau, the Russian troops under Bennigsen, after a bloody battle in which they lost 26,000 men killed and wounded, were compelled to retreat. On 25 April, 1807, Russia and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> signed the convention of Bartenstein, by which those two powers became allied against <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; and on 14 June of the same year the decisive defeat of Bennigsen at Friedland led Alexander to conclude with <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> the treaty of Tilsit, which was ratified 12 Oct., 1808, at Erfurt. At peace with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Russia turned her arms against Turkey, whose armies were defeated at Batynia by Kamenski (1810), and at Slobodsia by Kutuzoff (1811). The congress of <a href="../cathen/03045a.htm">Bukarest</a> (1812) insured to Russia the possession of Bessarabia. At the same time Russia was at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>.

<p>The Polish question and the Russian national sentiment, which was excited to a high degree against the French, brought about the great <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between Russia and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> that led to the ruin of the Napoleonic empire. The French army, consisting of 600,000 men of the various <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> nationalities, crossed the Russian frontiers, entered Vilna, and on 18 Aug., 1812, fought the Russians in a bloody battle at Smolensk. The battle of Borodino was fought on 7 Sept., and cost the Russians 40,000 men, while the French lost 30,000. On 14 Sept. <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> entered <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> to the sound of the Marseillaise. The city was set on fire. On the other hand an exceptionally severe winter set in. After a stay of thirty-five days at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> began the retreat, during which he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to defend himself, not only against the regular Russian troops, but also against the Cossacks and the peasants in search of booty. Between 26 and 29 Nov., on the right bank of the Beresina, near Studienka, 40,000 men of the Grand Army held 140,000 Russians in check, and with <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> succeeded in making a safe retreat. On 30 Dec., after Homeric struggles, Marshal Ney recrossed the Niemen with the remnant of the army. The Grand Army of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> had left 330,000 men killed and wounded in Russia. Russia had repelled the invader from her soil, and on 28 Feb., 1813, allied herself to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> by the Treaty of Kalish.

<p>The military genius of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> and his victories were unable to save his throne. On 31 March, 1814, Alexander I and the allied armies entered <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1815) placed the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> again under the sceptre of the Tsars, and withdrew that unhappy nation from the number of the free peoples. Its autonomy, however, remained to it under Alexander I, who also organized Finland as an independent grand duchy. That prince had a mind that was open to Liberal <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, which found a convinced promoter in the minister Speransky (1806-12); but the intrigues of Speransky's enemies undermined the influence that he exercised with Alexander, and his place was taken by Araktcheyeff, a man whose name in Russia is synonymous with blind reaction and ferocity. The reformist policy of Speransky ceased, and measures of the severest intolerance were adopted in politics, and even in the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> and literature. Alexander I was becoming more and more of a mystic, when death overtook him at Taganrog on 1 Dec., 1825. The popular <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> transformed him into a legendary hero, into a sovereign who, to expiate his faults, adopted the garb of a <em>muzhik</em>, and lived and died unknown among his most <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> subjects.

<p>Alexander was succeeded on 24 Dec., 1825, by Nicholas I, third son of Paul I. The beginning of his reign was marked by a revolution that broke out in December, and brought to its authors the name of <em>Dekabristi</em> or Decembrists. The most cultured and eminent men of Russia were engaged in this conspiracy, among them Pestel, Ryleeff, Muravieff-Apostol, and Bestuzheff-Riumin, who sought to establish a constitutional regime. Nicholas was most severe. The Decembrists ended their lives in Siberia or on the scaffold. They are regarded as the most illustrious <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of liberty in Russia. In his domestic policy Nicholas I continued the work of his predecessors with regard to the codification of the Russian <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. In 1830 there appeared the "Complete Collection of Russian Laws"; in 1838 the "Collection of Laws in Force", and in 1845 the penal code. The work of canal-making was continued, and the first railways in Russia were built; but every literary or political manifestation of Liberal <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> found in Nicholas I a fierce and inexorable adversary.

<p>In his foreign policy Nicholas continued the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, which by the treaty of 22 Feb., 1828, was compelled to cede the Provinces of Erivan and Nakhitchevan, to pay a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> indemnity, and to grant commercial concessions. The Russian fleet, together with the French and the English fleets, took part in the Battle of Navarino (20 Oct., 1827), in which the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> fleet was destroyed, and by which the independence of <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> was established. Russia continued the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Turkey in 1828 and 1829, until the Treaty of Adrianople (1829) secured to her the gains which she expected from her victories: the acquisition of <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> territory and commercial advantages. After a series of military expeditions, the Khan of Khiva finally became a vassal of the tsar (1854). The Polish insurrection of 1830, which was desired by the people rather than by the cultured and leading classes, put <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> and Lithuania at the mercy of fire and sword in 1830 and 1831, and cost <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> her autonomy, brought on her the policy of russianization, and led to the exile of thousands of victims to Siberia. <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> gave to Russia their moral support in her severe repression of the Polish revolution, which on the other hand found many sympathizers in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Nicholas I was the most determined enemy of the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> revolution of 1848. In 1849 the Russian army suppressed the Hungarian revolution, and saved the throne of Francis Joseph. In 1853 the question of the Holy Places, the antagonism of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and Russia in the East, and the <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> of Nicholas for a Russian protectorate over all the Orthodox states of the Balkans brought about the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between Russia and Turkey, and in 1854 the Crimean War. Turkey, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and later <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a> allied themselves against Russia. The allied fleets burned or bombarded the maritime strongholds of Russia, and in 1854 the allied armies invaded the Crimea, where on 20 Sept. the battle of the <a href="../cathen/01326c.htm">Alma</a> opened to them the way to Sebastopol. The Russians had prepared to make a desperate defence of that city, under one of the most daring and talented generals of the Russia of our day, Todleben. But the fortunes of the Crimean campaign now appeared disastrous for Russia. Nicholas I was heartbroken by it, and unable to withstand the blow that it dealt to his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, he died of a broken heart 3 March, 1855, while the star of Russian power in the East waned.

<p>The first care of his successor, Alexander II (1855-1881), was to bring the Crimean War to an honourable termination, and to prevent the political and <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> ruin of Russia. Sebastopol had fallen on 8 Sept., 1855. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> had cost Russia 250,000 men, and the Government had not funds to continue it. The Congress of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, on 25 Feb., 1856, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> Russia to accept terms of peace by which all the efforts and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of Peter I, Catherine II, and Alexander I to establish their power at Constantinople came to naught. The Black Sea was opened to all nations, and Russia was refused the protectorate over <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Christians in the East</a>. Alexander II understood that, to remedy the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> results of the Crimean War, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to establish great social reforms, and to curtail the power and limit the abuses of the bureaucracy. On 19 Feb., 1861, an imperial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> proclaimed the end of the serfdom of the rural classes, and restored to freedom 23,000,000 serfs. Important reforms were introduced into the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and that of the provincial governments; corporal punishment was abolished; the censorship of the Press was made less severe; foreigners were granted the same privileges enjoyed by Russians, and the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> that Nicholas I had abolished were restored. By all of which Alexander II acquired the good will of his people, who gave to him the title of Tsar Liberator. Other reforms were intended to mitigate the painful conditions of the Poles, whom the iron hand of Nicholas I had despoiled of their autonomy. But the imprudence of the Nationalist parties provoked the new Polish insurrection of 1863, which, notwithstanding the pacific remonstrances of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, brought its deathblow to Polish free government, cost <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> thousands of victims, and transformed that land into a field open to all the abuses of russianization. The Polish language was officially replaced by the Russian. Finland on the contrary was confirmed in all its privileges by Alexander II, who was exceptionally favourable to the German nobility of the Baltic provinces.

<p>During the reign of Alexander II, Russia took an active part in the affairs of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The Russian troops continued their slow, but persevering, invasion of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. The Kirghiz and the Turkomans became the vassals of Russia; the Khanates of Khokand and Samarkand were annexed to Russian territory, while those of Khiva and Bokhara were declared vassals; the influence of Russia over <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> was firmly established; the treaty of Tientsin (1858), and that of Peking (1860), secured to Russia the possession of all the left bank and of part of the right bank of the Amur; in all, 800,000 sq. miles. In 1867 Russia sold her American possessions to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. In 1875 <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> ceded the island of Sakhalin.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, under the guidance of the imperial chancellor, Prince Alexander Gortchakoff, Russia recognized the unity of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and remained indifferent to the aggrandizement of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and the crushing of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1870. On 21 Jan., 1871, she recognized the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. As the price of her neutrality, Russia demanded the abrogation of the clause of the treaty of 1856 which limited her military power on the Black Sea. A convention with Turkey (18 March, 1872) stipulated that Russia and Turkey could erect fortifications on the coasts of the Black Sea, and maintain fleets on its waters. The insurrection of <a href="../cathen/02694a.htm">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of Servia and Montenegro against Turkey (1876), the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> massacres (1875), and the victory, and later the defeat, of the <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servian</a> army at Djunis (1876) provoked a new crisis in the affairs of the East. Russia took up arms again in defence of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> of the Balkans. In April, 1878, the Russian armies crossed the Pruth and entered Rumania. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was a bloody one. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> generals, Suleiman Pasha, Osman Pasha, and Mukhtar Pasha, fought with great <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a>; but the tenacity of the Russians, their enthusiasm for a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> that seemed sacred to them, from the national and from the religious point of view, and the valour and military genius of the Russian generals, especially of Todleben and Skobeleff, triumphed. The most important episodes of the campaign were the repeated battles in the Shipka Pass (16 Aug.-17 Sept.) and the taking of Plevna (10 Dec.), when the Russians themselves expressed their admiration of the heroism of Osman Pasha and his troops. The Rumanians, <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a>, and Montenegrins fought beside the Russians, and with equal valour. From victory to victory the Russians marched with rapid strides along the road to Constantinople, and established themselves at San Stefano. Russia's ideal would have been attained if <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> had not stood in her way. On 3 March, 1878, the Russian ambassador, Ignatieff, signed with the Sublime Porte the Treaty of San Stefano, by which the Balkan States were organized. Russia received a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> indemnity of 310,000,000 roubles, the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> districts of Batum, Kars, Ardahan, and Bayazid, and the part of Bessarabia that was united to the Danubian Principalities in 1856. But the advantages that Russia obtained by the Treaty of San Stefano were revoked in great measure by the Treaty of Berlin (13 July, 1878). The map of the Balkans was remodelled so as to make Russia lose the influence that she had acquired over the Balkan States by her victories, while she saw the appearance in the East of a dangerous competitor, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, who had become the protector, and later the master, of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Russia surrendered Bayazid, and the course of the Danube from the Iron Gates to the Black Sea was declared neutral and closed to ships of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>.

<p>The victories obtained over the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> had not been sufficient to destroy the germs of revolution in Russia, fomented by the Nihulists. Alexander II was preparing to give a constitution to his people when the Nihilist plot of 13 March, 1881, put a tragic end to his life. He was succeeded by his son, Alexander III (1881-94). The constitutional projects of Alexander II were entirely abandoned; the counsellors of the tsar, and especially Ignatieff and Katkoff, bitter enemies of <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a>, induced the emperor to give to the principle of autocracy his strongest sanction. This reign was marked by the terrible massacres of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in 1881 and 1882; by the disorders of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> in 1882 and 1887, which led the government to subject the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> to severe supervision; by the rigorous censorship of the Press; by the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of a collection of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> that were intended to complete the work of liberation of the serfs and to better the <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> condition of the rural classes and lastly, by the great <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> and military development of Russia. The work of russianization was continued with activity, even with ferocity. The Caucasus lost its administrative autonomy; cruel and inhuman <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were framed against the Poles; the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were reduced to despair and hunger; the German <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of the Baltic provinces were treated like the Poles; and the autonomy of <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a> lacked little of being destroyed by force.

<p>Alexander III continued with the greatest success the Russian invasion of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. Russian territory, notwithstanding the opposition of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, grew at the expense of Afghanistan, <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, and Korea; the building of the Trans-Caspian Railway opened to Russia the strategic ways of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, Afghanistan, and <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>; the Trans-Siberian Railway was to endow Russia with an open sea, and to open a way of communication between <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> and the Pacific Ocean. The influence of Russia in the Balkans waned under Alexander III. The severity of the court of St. Petersburg towards Prince Alexander of Battenberg, and towards the national sentiment of the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>, and the tenacity with which Stambuloff conducted the campaign against the Russian policy in his country, greatly diminished the gratitude and good will of the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> towards Russia. The most important event in the foreign relations of Russia during the reign of Alexander III was the understanding with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Russia at first leaned towards <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; but after the German conventions with <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> (1879 and 1882) and the formation of the Triple Alliance, she turned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; for her friendly relations with this power Russia had also financial reasons, because she needed funds for the construction of her railways, especially the Trans-Siberian; and as the money market of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> had been closed to Russia by Bismarck, the French had lent her, in the years 1887, 1889, 1890, and 1891, more than 3,000,000,000 francs. In 1891 the French fleet, commanded by Admiral Gervais, visited Kronstadt, where the French sailors were received with an enthusiastic welcome. In June, 1893, a commercial treaty created more intimate relations between the two powers.
<h3 id="F">The reign of Nicholas II</h3>

<p>The successor of Alexander III is Nicholas II, born 6 May, 1868, and married 14 Nov., 1894, to the daughter of Louis IV, Grand Duke of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, the Empress Alexandra Feodorovna. The reign of Nicholas II has been unfortunate for Russia. He was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> in May, 1896, in the presence of delegates of nearly all the civilized nations and of a special mission of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, at the head of which was Cardinal Agliardi; and a few days after his <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a>, on the occasion of a feast given in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, a thousand people were crushed to death by crowding. In 1898 a convention between <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> and Russia placed Port Arthur under the control of the latter power for a space of twenty-five years, granted the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to connect that port with the Trans-Siberian Railway, and secured to the Russians a free way to the Pacific Ocean. By this convention Russia took a preponderant position in the Far East, and already contemplated the conquest of Korea, to the detriment of <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. In 1896 <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> had already granted to Russia the right of way for the prolongation of the Trans-Siberian Railway as far as Mukden. The domestic policy, thanks especially to the inspirations of de Plehve and of Constantini Pobiedonostseff, was one of fierce repression and russianization. It was intended to crush the Polish element and to deprive Finland of its autonomy. To carry out this policy, General Bobrikoff was appointed governor of <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a>. He fell in 1898 a victim of the exasperated patriotism of a student. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> especially were made objects of legal as well as illegal persecutions, which led to the massacres of Gomel and Kishineff in 1903. This policy of russianization brought about a renewal of the activities of the terrorists, who in 1901 and 1902 <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of public instruction, Bogoliepoff and Sipiagin, and in 1904 de Plehve.

<p>In 1899 at the initiative of Nicholas II the conference of the Hague was convoked, to consider the question of disarmament and the maintenance of universal peace. How commercial this initiative was, Russia herself soon showed, for in 1904 she broke off diplomatic negotiations with <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> demanded that Russia should evacuate <a href="../cathen/09585a.htm">Manchuria</a> and give up her project of conquering Korea. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was fought with equal valour by both combatants on land and sea; but the Russians lost Port Arthur, were driven from Korea, and saw their fleet annihilated at Tsushima. Russia could have continued her disastrous <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, but the growth of the revolution at home compelled her to consent to the proposals of peace that were made by President Roosevelt of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. On 16 Aug., 1905, there was concluded at <a href="../cathen/12296a.htm">Portsmouth</a>, <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>, U. S., a peace that was ratified on 1 Oct. of the same year. Meanwhile Russia was in the throes of the revolution, in Jan., 1905, the troops fired upon thousands of workmen who were making a demonstration and there were several hundred victims. In February the Grand Duke Sergius was torn to fragments by a bomb. A man-of-war of the Black Sea fleet mutinied: a military revolt broke out at <a href="../cathen/16081b.htm">Viborg</a>. The tsar, to stop the revolutionary flood, in October granted a constitution by an imperial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> in which he proclaimed liberty of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, of the Press, and of association, re-established the ancient privileges of Finland, and promised to alleviate the conditions of the non-Russian subjects of the empire.

<p>On 27 April, 1906, the <em>Duma</em>, which consisted in great part of Liberal members, was opened. It lasted two months. The right of suffrage was limited; nevertheless, the second <em>Duma</em>, which lasted a hundred days, had a revolutionist and socialist majority. The government reformed the electoral <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and in that way was able to secure the election of a <em>Duma</em> that was more in accord with its wishes, containing among its members forty-two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>. Notwithstanding the proclamation of liberty of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and of the Press, there was a return to the old policy, recourse being had to the most severe methods of repression to put down revolutionary movements and the ferocious banditism of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> and the Caucasus. Exceptional <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against the Poles and Finns were revived.

<p>From 1907 to 1911 the Russian Government, though constitutional in appearance, has endeavoured to strengthen its autocratic regime and to render illusory all its promises of constitutional liberty. During this period, the reins of government were in the strong and energetic hands of Peter Arkadevitch Stolypin, born at Srednikovo near <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, 1862, and governor of Saratoff in 1906. Appointed to the Ministry of the Interior 26 April, 1906, and premier on 8 July, 1906, he applied himself with unshaken purpose to re-establish internal order in Russia. In the beginning he seemed to be animated by Liberal sentiments, but pressure from the court party and on the other hand the crimes of the Terrorists led him to ally himself with that faction of the <em>Duma</em> which opposed the constitution as harmful to the solidarity of Russia. In internal politics he sought to limit the powers of the <em>Duma</em>, to maintain in all their vigour the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, to crush the obstinacy of the Finns by transforming the Government of <a href="../cathen/16081b.htm">Viborg</a> into a Russian province and impeding in every way the Diet of Helsingfors, to suppress the Polish national movement by limiting the number of Polish deputies in the <em>Zemstva</em> of western Russia, and by dividing administratively the Province of Chelm from the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. In foreign politics Russia has suffered from its defeat in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. The annexation of <a href="../cathen/02694a.htm">Bosnia</a> and Herzogovina came near precipitating a conflict between <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and Russia, almost involving all the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> of the Balkan states, but <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria's</a> military superiority, in addition to the support of the German Emperor, induced Russian diplomacy to moderate its demands. In the meantime, Russia has been preoccupied in reorganizing its own military and naval forces, in efficaciously directing colonizations in <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a>, in penetrating tentatively into <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and in agitating its own political propaganda in the Austrian provinces of Galicia and Bukovina. The revolution seemed to have been suppressed when, in Sept., 1911, Stolypin, in the Imperial Theatre of Kieff, fell under the dagger of a Jewish lawyer called Bogroff.
