<p>The subject will be treated under the following heads, viz. <ol type=I><li>RUSSIAN LANGUAGE; <li>ANCIENT POPULAR LITERATURE; <li>FIRST MONUMENTS OF RUSSIAN LITERATURE; <li>LITERATURE FROM THE ELEVENTH TO THE THIRTEENTH CENTURIES; <li>LITERATURE FROM THE FOURTEENTH TO THE SIXTEENTH CENTURIES; <li>LITERATURE OF LITTLE RUSSIA AND GREAT RUSSIA IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY; <li>RUSSIAN LITERATURE OF THE TIME OF PETER THE GREAT; <li>LITERATURE OF RUSSIA IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY; <li>LITERATURE OF RUSSIA IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY; <li>CONTEMPORARY RUSSIAN LITERATURE.</ol>
<h2 id="section1">Russian language</h2>

<p>Russian is a <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> language belonging to the Indo-European <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. The dispersion of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> tribes in prehistoric times resulted in the formation of various <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> dialects, of which Shafarik counted twelve, although other writers recognize only six or seven. The <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> dialects are divided into the South-Eastern dialects and the Western dialects. To the former, which culminate in the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a>, belongs the Russian, or rather the three Russian dialects of Great <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, Little <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and White Russia. Russian has many affinities with the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> and Servian languages, because <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> received her primitive literature from the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> and <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a>. The absence of documents, however, makes it impossible to define with precision the character of the primitive language of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, or rather the relations between that language and the Russian of literature. According to Sreznevski and Lavroff, the similarity between the two languages was almost complete, and consisted in turns of expression rather than in grammatical forms. Before the thirteenth century, the literary, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>, and administrative language was one. But in the fourteenth century the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> language began to differ from the literary language and this difference grew considerably in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The Pal&aelig;oslavic or <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> language, however, varied little in either case from the language of the people. In time Russian underwent local changes of form that gave rise to the dialects of Kieff, Novgorod, Vladimir, and <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>. The Vareghi, the Greeks, the Tatars, the Lithuanians, and the Poles left traces of their political domination on the language of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and in the time of Peter the Great many words were added from German, French, and English. The question of the primitive language of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> is connected with the ethnological question, and in the nineteenth century gave rise to lengthy and spirited polemics which, however, led to no definite results. A leading work for the study of this controversy is Buslaeff's "Historical Grammar of the Russian Language" (1858). Political and nationalist questions also enter into the philological researches concerning the primitive language of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, or Little Russians, claim that their language was the original Russian, and therefore that primitive Russian literature should rather be called <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a>. On the other hand Sobolevski and the nationalists of Great <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> declare that the present <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> is not the primitive language of Kieff. This philological controversy between the nationalists of Little <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and those of Great <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> has not yet terminated.
<h2 id="section2">Ancient popular literature</h2>

<p>From its earliest history <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> has possessed a literature that was handed down by tradition from generation to generation. It was not before the seventeenth century that this literature took a written form. The collection of Russian proverbs was begun: in the eighteenth century Daniloff published the first collection of Russian <em>byline:</em> at the end of the same century and at the beginning of the nineteenth, Tchulkoff, Popoff, and Macaroff published the first collections of popular songs. Upon this literature, which conveys so much information on the religious, civil, and social life of primitive <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, great light was thrown by the studies of Kalaidovitch, Snegireff, Sakharoff, Kirieevski, Bielinski, Athanasieff, Kostomoroff, Maikoff, Buslaeff, Bezsonoff, and Vselovski. The popular Russian songs are divided into several classes. There are the mystic or ritual songs (<em>obriadnyia piesni</em>), which were sung in the sacred games, and on other solemn occasions; they contain many memories of the ancient <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> feasts, celebrating the glories of Dazh-Bog (the sun-god), of Koliada (traced by Russian writers to the Latin <em>Calend&oelig;</em>), and of Ovsen. Others, illustrating the promiscuity of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> tradition, celebrate the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> (<em>sviatotchnyja piesni</em>); others relate to the spring feasts (<em>vesnianki</em>), or accompany the dance (<em>khorovodnyja</em>). To this same class belong the nuptial songs (<em>svadebnyja</em>), the <em>kupal'skija</em> (literally, songs of the baths), the <em>rusal'nyja</em>, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <em>Rusalke</em>, a term that probably served to designate the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the departed.

<p>The <em>byline</em> are the most beautiful treasures of this popular literature, of which they form the heroic cycle. The term <em>byline</em> is derived from the verb <em>byl</em> (it was), and etymologically signifies the recital of that which happened in times gone by. They tell of the deeds of the legendary heroes of primitive <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. History, legend, and mythology together furnish the matter of these epic songs. In them the Russian heroes are called <em>bogatyr</em>, a name that some believe to be derived from <em>Bog</em> (<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>), as if they were demigods; others believe that the term is derived from Tatar or Mongolian; and yet others from the Sanskrit (<em>bhaga</em>, force, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>). The heroes who are immortalized in the <em>byline</em> belong to the epoch of Vladimir the Great, or to more ancient times, and partake of a mythological character. These heroes, who act together with those of the time of Vladimir the Great, but nevertheless are endowed with a mythological character, are Sviatogor, Mikula Selianinovitch, Volga Sviatoslavitch, Sukhman Odikhmant&eacute;vitch, and Don Ivanovitch; the historians of Russian literature designate them by the epithet of <em>starshie</em> ("ancient heroes"). The "young heroes" (<em>mladshie</em>) belong historically to the epoch of Vladimir; their names are Elia Muromec, Dobrynja Nikititch, Alesha Popovitch, Solovei Budimirovitch, etc. Kieff is so to speak, their geographical centre, and Vladimir their star. In the Russian chronicles they are mentioned between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries. Elia of Murom lived at the end of the twelfth century, and his remains rest in the grotto of the sanctuary of Petcherskaia at Kieff. They combat the monsters that assail <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> from within or from without, that is, <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> and thieves among the first, and the Petchenegi, the Polovcy, and the Chozari among the second. The historical, philological, and poetical importance of these ancient monuments of literature is very great. Other <em>byline</em> of later date, more commonly called historical songs, refer to the Tatar invasions, to the period of Ivan the Terrible, and also to that of Peter the Great. The songs and legends of Little <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> are called <em>dumy</em> (elegies, ballads), and celebrate the struggles of the Cossacks and Little Russians against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> or Tatars and the Poles, and the union of Little <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> with Great <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. The songs that refer to domestic life are called <em>bytovyja piesni</em>. They sing the popular feasts and games, and the sad as well as <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> events of domestic life, while they preserve many traces of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>. The best collections of them are those of Tchulkoff (St. Petersburg, 1770-74); Novikoff (Moscow, 1780-81); and Sakharoff (St. Petersburg, 1838-39).



<p>To popular literature belong the fanciful novels called <em>skazki</em>, which resemble somewhat the stories of the Fates. Their protagonists are strange beings created by the ardent popular fancy, <em>Baba-Iaga</em>, serpents with six or twelve heads, stags, horses, etc. The forces of nature are personified. At times the mythological element predominates in them entirely; and again it is blended with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The oldest novels are characterized by their simplicity and by the repose of their recital. Some of them, like the one entitled "The Judgment of Shemjaka", are satirical compositions. Others are derived from Western novels, especially the Italian. The proverbs also belong to popular literature. They are called <em>poslovicy</em>, and are very abundant, the first complete collection of them having been made by D. Kniazhevitch in 1822. They are the spontaneous product of the wisdom, caustic spirit, and rudimentary culture of the Russian people, and reflect the various historical ages of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Some of them date from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> times, others emanate from the people's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, and others originate in the events that produced the greatest impressions on the popular <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. To popular literature belong also the enigmas or riddles (<em>zagadki</em>), collected by Khudiakoff (Moscow, 1861) and by Sadovinikoff (St. Petersburg, 1876); the incantations (<em>zagovory</em>), the conjurations (<em>zakliatia</em>), and the lullabies (<em>platchi</em>), which are most useful for the study of Russian folk-lore and primitive Russian life.
<h2 id="section3">First monuments of Russian literature</h2>

<p>The first written literature of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> is coincident with the conversion of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> was the first <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> educator of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and the first translations of the Scriptures and the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> were <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a>. The most ancient monument of Russian literature, and at the same time of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Pal&aelig;oslavic language common to the primitive <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, is the Gospel called "Ostromirovo", written at Novgorod in 1056-57 by the Deacon Gregor, by order of Ostromir, first magistrate (<em>posadnik</em>) of the city. This valuable document was published by Vostokoff in 1843. Ancient Russian literature is of an eminently <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>. The greater portion of its monuments are sermons, <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>, letters, lives of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>; even the profane works, as chronicles and voyages, have a religious tone. On the other hand, owing to the fact that the Russians received their <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> from Byzantium, their literature was openly Byzantine in character, the early Russians either translating the Byzantine works, or being inspired by the spirit of those works, and writing as if they were <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a>. Primitive Russian literature, however, was subject also to other influences. The <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> influence was due to the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> and <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a>, who, until the fifteenth century, gave many cultured men to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, e.g., the Metropolitan Cyprian and Gregor Camblak. Greek influence lasted a longer time, and flourished in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

<p>Russian literature in the beginning consisted of translations from the Greek and of original works. Its development was very slow, because the prices of <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> were very high. The copying of books was considered not only a useful contribution to culture, but a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> work. The Princess of Polotsk, <a href="../cathen/05606c.htm">St. Euphrosyne</a> (twelfth century), copied books, a work to which <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and even <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, devoted themselves. Russian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were wont to go to Constantinople, or to <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Mount Athos</a>, and there to become amanuenses and enrich the first Russian <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> by their work. The first books that were translated were those of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> that were most used by the people (Psalms, the Gospels, Proverbs, Wisdom of Solomon, Ecclesiastes, Wisdom of Jesus the son of Sirach). There were also collections of extracts from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, called <em>Paremii</em>. The translation of all the books of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> in a single codex was made in 1499, by order of Gennadius Gonzoff, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Novgorod (1484-1504).

<p>Simultaneously with the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, the writings of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> were greatly in vogue, especially those of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>. Highly esteemed also were the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> explanations of <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a>, the canons of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> of St. Theodore the Studite, the discourses of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> against <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, the discourses of <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, the "Klimax" of <a href="../cathen/08457a.htm">St. John Climacus</a>, and the works of St. Isaac the Syrian, <a href="../cathen/05498a.htm">St. Ephraem the Syrian</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a>. Until the seventeenth century, the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> writings of <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a> were the sources of Russian Orthodox <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. The great popularity of the works of the Fathers gave rise to the formation of collections of extracts from their discourses, and to annotated copies, with explanations, for the study of their writings, called <em>sborniki</em>, of which there are several: "Zlatoust", a collection of moral sermons and <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> (112), mostly from <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>; "Margarit", another collection from <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, included in the monologue of the Metropolitan Macarius, and published for the first time at Ostrog in 1596; "Izmaragd", a collection of sermons and <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> from St. Basil, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, St. Ephraem, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a>; "Andriatis", a collection of the <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> recited by <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>; "Zlataia ciep" (golden chain), a collection of discourses on the moral virtues, taken from the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> and from Russian writers; the "Ptchely" (bees), a collection of the literary flowers of St. Maximus the Confessor. The famous "Sbornik" of Sviatoslaff Yaroslaffitch, Prince of Tchernigoff, which was translated in <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> from the Greek, for the Tsar Simeon, in 1073, also has texts from the Fathers and from profane writers.

<p>The Greek <em>synaxaria</em>, the <em>Patereka</em> of Sinai and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, translated in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and the "Patericon" of the Petcherskaia Shrine of Kieff, which is very valuable for the study of primitive Russian <a href="../cathen/07106b.htm">hagiology</a>, are of a sacro-historical character. The Greek <em>synaxaria</em> took in Russian the name of <em>Prologos</em>. Collections of discourses in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the feasts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> received the name of "Torzhestvenniki". An historical compendium of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, called "Palei", from <em>palaia diatheke</em>, dates from the earliest times of <a href="../cathen/13253a.htm">Russian Christianity</a>. The oldest <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> of the "Palei" are of the fourteenth century, but their origin is much older. To sacred and profane literature belong the so-called <em>chronographoi</em>, collections and transformations of writings of Byzantine chroniclers, especially of <a href="../cathen/08466c.htm">Malala</a>, Amartolos, Manasses, and <a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a>, as also the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> version of the "Christian Topography" of <a href="../cathen/04404a.htm">Cosmas Indicopleustes</a>.

<p>Partly to sacro-profane and partly to profane literature belong many novels and stories translated from Byzantine, <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servian</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> writings, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. One of the most famous novels, taken from the literature of Constantinople, is the history of Barlaam and Josaphat. At the end of the sixteenth century, the influence of Polish literature helped to spread in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> two works that were much in vogue in the West, the "Gesta Romanorum", and the "Speculum Magnum." The <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> books of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> (story of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a>; story of the Tree of the Cross; story of the Just Enoch, etc.), and those of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> (story of Aphroditian on the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>; dispute of Christ with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a>; conversation of Adam and Lazarus in Limbo, etc.) were also widely disseminated in the literature of that time. There were also translated into Pal&aelig;orussian the "Elucidarium sive dialogus de summa totius religionis christian&aelig;", attributed to <a href="../cathen/07461a.htm">Honorius of Autun</a> by <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>; books of magic and books of <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a> ("Gromnik", "Molnianik", "Koliadnik", etc). Under the influence of this literature, religious songs were created that became very popular with the people (<em>Dukhovnye stikhi</em>). These little poems or songs treat of the most varied subjects, and it is very difficult to divide them into different classes. They are of a moral and <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>, referring to the Creation, to <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">St. Michael the Archangel</a>, to the sufferings of the damned, to the birth or passion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, to the Russian <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, etc. And beside these poetical productions sprang up the hagiological legends, of which the best known refer to <a href="../cathen/11063b.htm">St. Nicholas of Myra</a>, St. Parasceve, and St. Cassian. The deep researches of Arkhangelski and Sobolevski throw a great deal of light on the Russian versions of the Fathers and of the Byzantine writings.
<h2 id="section4">Literature from the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries</h2>

<p>Russian literature, properly so called, from the period of the advent of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> to the time of Peter the Great, comprises discourses, instructions, and letters that are intended to infuse <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sentiments, and to draw the people from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> practices; polemical works, directed at first against the Latins, and later against the first Russian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>; lives of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, chronicles, and historical Works, <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> and voyages, and juridical monuments. There is almost a total absence of poetry. The first centres of culture were Kieff and Novgorod; in the sixteenth century, <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>. Among the writers who left a name for sacred eloquence in the period from the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries, mention is made of Luke Zhidiata, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Novgorod (1035-59), whose discourse is a brief recapitulation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of the Faith; <a href="../cathen/07347a.htm">St. Hilarion</a>, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Kieff in 1051, whose discourses contain very valuable data for the early history of <a href="../cathen/13253a.htm">Russian Christianity</a>; the Blessed Theodosius Petcherski, who wrote discourses for the people and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; Nicephorus, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Kieff (1104-20), whose discourses and letters, written in Greek were translated later into Russian; Cyril of Turoff (1171-82), a brilliant writer who, on account of his natural and vigorous eloquence, resembling that of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, is called the <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. His discourses, <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>, writings on monastic life, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are among the most important monuments of the ancient <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> literature of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>.

<p>The polemics against the Latins found almost their only exponents among the Greeks who in the beginning governed the Russian <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Leontius, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> (992-1008), wrote against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>; George, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> (1065-73), wrote a "Dispute with a Latin", in which the various pretended innovations of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> are attacked; Ivan II (1186-89) is the author of a letter to <a href="../cathen/04018a.htm">Clement III</a>, in which the Latins are reproved only on account of the insertion of the <em>Filioque</em> in the Creed. The letter on the Faith of the Vareghi (or <em>Variazhskoi vierie</em>), which by some is attributed, although without strong arguments, to St. Theodosius Petcherski, is believed by some to be of Russian origin. Among the first Russian hagiologists mention should be made of Jacob, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the Petcherskaia hermitage, who wrote an account of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of Sts. Boris and Glieba, and the panegyric of St. Vladimir; of Nestor, the most famous of the ancient Russian writers, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the hermitage of Kieff, who died in 1114. He is the author of the lives of Boris and Glieba of the Blessed Theodosius, and of a chronicle ("Lietopis") The original of the chronicle of Nestor has not come down to us; the most ancient copy of it is that of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Lawrence, made in 1377 for Demetrius Constantinovitch, Prince of Suzdal. Nestor was not the first Russian chronicler. Other chroniclers, whose names and works have not been handed down to our times, wrote before him at Novgorod. The national and literary importance of the chronicle of Nestor is very great. The <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russians</a> rightly consider it as an epic history, warm with the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of country. It finishes with the year 1110, but was continued by other writers, under various names, as "Chronicle of Kieff", "Chronicle of Volhynia", "Chronicle of Suzdal", etc. They are of an eminently <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>, and abound in texts from the Scriptures and in ascetic considerations.

<p>Another important work in which the Russian national sentiment predominates is the journey of the <em>higumeno</em> Daniel (thirteenth century) to the Holy Places: before the Holy Sepulchre he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> "for all the land of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>". Anthony, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Novgorod, visited Constantinople four years after the taking of that city by the Latins (1204), and left a short but very important description of its <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>.

<p>To profane literature belong the "Testament" Vladimir Monomachus, written in 1099, in which its author gives a recital of his enterprises; and the celebrated account of the battle of Igor ("Slovo" or "Polku Igorevie"), which was found in 1795 in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of Count Musin Pushkin. It is the only poetical work of the <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> of the princes, and relates the military expedition of Igor Sviatoslavitch, Prince of Novgorod-Sieverski, against the Polovcy (1185). It is characterized by the grandeur of its poetical sentiment, the beauty of its descriptions, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of country. In the twelfth century was written the discourse of Daniel Zatotchnik (<em>Captivus</em>), who, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the Government of Olonetz, writes to a prince to ask for his liberty, making a great display of his learning. Among the juridical monuments of that age we may cite the "Russkaia Pravda" (Russian code) of Prince Yaroslaff I, and the Greek <em>Nomocanon</em>, translated in the earliest times of <a href="../cathen/13253a.htm">Russian Christianity</a>, and qualified with the epithet of <em>Kormtchaia kniga</em>, corresponding to the Greek <em>pedalion</em>. To the <em>nomocanon</em> were added the "Ecclesiastical Regulations" ("Cerkovnye ustavy") of Vladimir and Yaroslaff, which however are not of those princes, at least in the form in which they have been transmitted to us in <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> of the thirteenth century. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were centres of the literary culture of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> in the eleventh and twelfth centuries; and the Greco-Russian <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> laboured for the diffusion of it. From the Greek <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> came the polemical works, and the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the Latins that became fixed in the hearts of the Russian people. The first Greek polemics who lived in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> spread the most absurd <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> against the Latins, and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> the most simple <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> customs: the Metropolitan George enumerated twenty-seven points of divergence between the Greeks and Latins. The thirteenth century is very poor from the standpoint of literature. The Tatar invasions stopped the progress of culture, and prevented <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> work. Among the literary monuments of that century are cited a letter of Simon, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vladimir (1215-26), to Polycarp, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the Petcherskaia hermitage; the life of Abraham of Smolensk, a most important historical document; the sermons of Serapion, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vladimir (1274-75), and a synodal and canonical decision of Cyril II, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Kieff (1243-80), which is inserted in the <em>Kormtchaia kniga</em>.
<h2 id="section5">Literature from the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries</h2>

<p>In the period from the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries, literary culture, paralyzed by Tatar oppression in the region of Kieff, continued to flourish at Novgorod and Pskof, and from there was carried to other centres, viz., Vladimir, Rostoff, Murom, Yaroslaff, Tver, Ryazan, and finally <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, which received the name of the Third <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In the fourteenth century sacred sermons were written by various authors, among whom were Peter, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>; Alexei, another <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> (1293-1377) who, in a codex of the Gospel which he transcribed, corrected the ancient <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> version in many points, by the Greek original; Matvei, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sarai; the Metropolitan Cyprian (1376-1406), a <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servian</a> by birth, who also left various letters and translated the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> (<em>Sluzhebnik</em>), the <em>Nomocanon</em>, etc.; the Blessed Cyril, founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Bielozero, the author of several letters to the sons of Prince Demetrius Donskoi; Basil, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Novgorod (1331-1352), who wrote a letter to Feodor, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tver, to convince him of the existence of a <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">terrestrial paradise</a>. <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> descriptions of Constantinople and its <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> in the fourteenth century were left by Stephen, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Novgorod, by Ignatius, a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of Smolensk, and by Alexandr D'jak ("judge", "magistrate"). Among the novels special mention should be made of the "Zadonshina", written by Sofronio or Sofonio of Ryazan, an epic story that relates the military acts of Prince Demetrius Donskoi, who vanquished the Tatars at Kulikovo (1380).

<p>In the fifteenth century the beginning of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> in <a href="../cathen/13253a.htm">Russian Christianity</a>, which originated in the decadence of monastic asceticism as well as in the gross <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, opened up new fields to Russian religious polemics. Photius, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> (1410-31) and Gregor Camblak, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Kieff (1416) composed letters and moral sermons; Gennadius, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Novgorod (1485-1504), wrote against the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaizers</a>, which originated in that city about 1471; the <em>higumeno</em> Josef Sanin of Polotsk assailed the same <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> in his tedious work "Prosvietitel" ("the illuminator"). Nil Sorski (1433-1508), founder of a hermitage on the banks of the Sora River, is the author of writings that were directed towards the reformation of the ideals and the life of Russian monasticism. Among the travellers of this period Zosimus, hiero-deacon of the hermitage of St. Sergius, and a merchant, Basil, left accounts of their <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> to the Holy Land. Simeon, hiero-monk of Suzdal, accompanied Isidore, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>, and left an interesting recital of his voyage to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and a short but important account of the council, which is one of the monuments of the Russian polemics against the Latins. Anthony Nikitin, a merchant of Tver, went to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> through <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> in 1466, returned to his country in 1472, and in the account of his travels gave important information on the religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> of the people of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. In historical literature, besides the valuable sketch of the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>, there should be mentioned the account of the foundation and the taking of Constantinople, which was very popular among the Russians.

<p>The sixteenth century, as Porfir&eacute;ff rightly states, was one of criticism and restoration. Its literature, always eminently religious, proposed to revive the ancient customs, and the ancient traditions, and to restore religion and the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. The most famous and most learned champion of these reforms was Maximus the Greek, born at Arta, in <a href="../cathen/01253b.htm">Albania</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He entered monastic life on <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Mount Athos</a>, and in 1518 repaired to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, where he took an active part in the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> life of the country, and in the correction of the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a>; he suffered a painful <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> in various <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, from 1525 to 1553, and died at the hermitage of St. Sergius in 1556. A most learned <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, he wrote polemical works against the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaizers</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, and the Latins, especially in opposition to the supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and to the <em>Filioque;</em> he combatted <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a>, and wrote short works and discourses on moral subjects. Among the Russian <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the sixteenth century, Daniel, elected <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> in 1522, acquired fame. He was the author of sixteen discourses that prove him to have read assiduously, and to have had a profound <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of patristic literature. The most important monument of the literature of the sixteenth century is the "Domostroi", attributed to Sylvester, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who was the contemporary of Ivan the Terrible; Sylvester was, however, the compiler rather than the author of the work. It is a book of a moral character, in which are propounded the rules for living according to the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the Faith and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of man as a member of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and the way to govern the home well and to care for domestic economy. The "Domostroi", therefore, is a compendium of the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> man, and at the same time a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> picture of the social and domestic organization of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> in the sixteenth century. Another great work, which had remained unpublished until now but which the Arch&aelig;ographical Commission of St. Petersburg is now bringing to light, is the "Tchet'y Minei" of the Metropolitan Macarius of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> (1542-64). From the beginnings of its literature, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> possessed lives of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, the number which increased from century to century. The Metropolitan Macarius collected into a vast work the lives of all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the Greco-Russian Church, adding panegyrics and discourses in their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and also whole books of Scripture, with commentaries, writings of the Fathers, and <em>synaxaria</em>, so that his <a href="../cathen/10191b.htm">menologies</a> are almost a complete r&eacute;pertoire of the ancient literature of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, rather than a simple hagiological collection. To the same century belong the hagiological legends, which are lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, or episodes in them, embellished by popular fancy, examples of which are the legends of the Tsarevitch Peter (thirteenth century), of St. Mercurius, of Martha and Mary, of Prince Peter of Murom, and of his consort, Febronia.

<p>Prince Andrew Kurbski, a warm defender of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, translated the dialectics and the <em>Pege gnoseos</em> of <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a>, and wrote a brief history of the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> and a history of Ivan the Terrible, with whom he was in correspondence; these letters are preserved to our day. An important work of religious polemics was written by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Zinovii of Otna, who refuted the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> and Judaistic doctrines of Kosoi. The title of the work is "Istiny pokazanie" (demonstration of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>), and it consists of fifty-six chapters. Of the sixteenth century there are also two small works, written in refutation of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, which at that time was beginning to spread in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Among the Russian <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> who visited the Holy Places and who wrote an account of their travels the most distinguished are Trifon Korobeinikoff and George Grekoff, who went to Jerusalem in 1583.
<h2 id="section6">Literature of little Russia and great Russia in the seventeenth century</h2>

<p>The seventeenth century witnessed the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> of Little <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, which became the instructor of Great <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Under <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Polish influence Little <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> drew near to the West, assimilated Western <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, and modelled its <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> upon those of the Latins. The "Union" of Brest in 1596 gave an efficient impulse to Orthodox culture. Confraternities were established to open <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and printing-offices for the publication and dissemination of polemical works; among them those of <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>, and Kieff were famous. <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic theology and philosophy</a> entered into and dominated the Russian academies and <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. Latin became the official language in the teaching of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Peter Mogilas, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Kieff, transformed into a superior <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> established by the Confraternity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Apparition of the Lord. The works of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> exercised a great influence on Orthodox <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, and in the academy of Kieff the Immaculate Conception was upheld. The literature of the religious polemics against the Latins, to which the Union of Brest gave rise, is very rich. In 1597 was published the "Ekthesis", or Orthodox history of the Union of Brest; Kristofor Bronski, under the pseudonym of Filalete, wrote the "Apokrisis" against <a href="../cathen/14034a.htm">Peter Skarga</a>, and later the "Perestroga" (admonishment). Meletius Smotricki, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Polotsk (died 1633), wrote the "Threnos" and other works of religious polemic, and finally embraced <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>; in 1622 Zacharias Kopystenski wrote the "Palinodia", the most important work in this polemical literature. The writings of Meletius Smotricki in defence of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, which he had on other occasions so strenuously opposed, were confuted by Andrew Muzkilovski, by Job Borecki, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Kieff, and by Gelasius Diplic. Joannikius Galiatovski, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the academy of Kieff (died 1688), wrote several works against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, one of them against the <em>Filioque</em>, confuted the Hebrews in his work "The True Messias", and also wrote several works in refutation of the <a href="../cathen/08692a.htm">Koran</a>. Another polemic against the Latins was Lazarus Baranovitch, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Tchernigoff (died 1694); in a work that was directed against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Boyme, he opposed the supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the Procession of the Holy Ghost from the Son.

<p>The first Orthodox catechisms appeared in the seventeenth century, written by Laurence Zizanii and by Peter Mogilas; the latter, in the work <em>Lithos</em> (attributed to him), defends the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> against the charge of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>; he is considered to be the author of the famous Orthodox Confession of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, approved by the special Council of <a href="../cathen/08325b.htm">Jassy</a> in 1643. Among the preachers whom the sacred orators of the East sought to imitate, mention may again be made of Joannikius Galiatovski, who wrote a treatise on the art of oratory, entitled "Kliutch razumienia"; Anthony Radivilovski, <em>higumeno</em> of the hermitage of Kieff; and Lazarus Baranovitch. In 1591 there was published at <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a> the first Slavo-Greek grammar; Lawrence Zizanii wrote a <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> grammar in 1596, and the grammar of Meletius Smotricki was published in 1619. Zizanii added a small <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> dictionary to his grammar, but the first Slavo-Russian lexicon was published by Berynda, hiero-monk of Kieff, in 1627. Western influence is revealed also in the poetry of the academy of Kieff. Besides the sacred cantata, the "Mysteries" were introduced to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and colleges; these "Mysteries" were sacred plays, modelled upon those of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a>. Among the historical works of Little <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, mention should be made of the "Synopsis" of the history of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> by Innocent Gizel, Archimandrite of Kieff, the "Enegesis" or history of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Kieff, and the"Paterikon" of the Petcherskaia hermitage by Sylvester Kossoff, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Kieff (died 1657).

<p>From Kieff Western culture was carried to <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, to which city masters and learned men of Little <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> were called to organize <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, compose works, and print books; but they did not receive a friendly welcome. Their <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> was suspected; the more so since several of the most illustrious <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of Kieff admitted with the Latins the dogmatic <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Immaculate Conception, and the efficacy of the words of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> alone to effect <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a>. The suspicion against the purity of their <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> teachings became so strong that the Russians turned to the Greeks for masters. In 1685 the Greek <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was established at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, and in time took the name of Greco-Slav-Latin Academy. Its first masters were the Greek hieromonks Joannikius and Sophronius Likhudes, who had studied in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and who taught Greek literature at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> from 1685 to 1694. They wrote many polemical works against the Latins, against <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and against the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of Little <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> who leaned towards the Latins, especially against Sylvester Medviedeff. In <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> literature the most distinguished authors were Epiphanius Slavinecki, the first of Russian bibliographers; Arsenius Sukhanoff, author of "A Voyage to the Holy Land" ("Proskynitarion"); Simon Polocki (of Polotsk), author of one of the first systematic treatises on Orthodox <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> ("Vienec viery"), and also of sermons that are highly prized, of sacred poems, and of sacred plays; <a href="../cathen/04706b.htm">St. Demetrius</a> of Rostoff (1651-1709), one of the most illustrious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Russian Church, a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, historian, poet, polemic, and hagiologist. He was the author of two Orthodox catechisms, of a very strong work against the <a href="../cathen/12648b.htm">Raskolniki</a> ("Rozysk"), of a diary of his life, the "Tcheti minei" (menologies), a work upon which he spent twenty years; many sacred discourses that are appreciated for the simplicity of their style and for their depth of religious sentiment, and, finally, of several sacred plays, one of the most interesting of which is the "Birthday".

<p>Epiphanius Slavinecki and an unnamed <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Orel were also distinguished as sacred orators. The former rendered a great service to Patristic literature by translating into Russian a great many of the writings of the Fathers (<a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a>, <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, St. Basil, and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a>). One of his scholars, Eutimius, wrote a polemical work, called "Osten", against the theories of Sylvester Medviedeff, who sided with the Latins in the question of the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a>. Against the <a href="../cathen/12648b.htm">Raskolniki</a>, besides <a href="../cathen/04706b.htm">St. Demetrius</a> of Rostoff, there wrote Simeon of Polotsk in 1666 ("Zhely pravlenija"); in 1682 the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, Jacob ("Uviet dukhovnii"); likewise, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Siberia, Ignatius, and George Krizhanitch. The latter, who was a student of the Greek College of St. Athanasius at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1640), became famous on account of his theories of the cause of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> between East and West, which he attributed to politics and the antagonism between Greeks and Latins, due to Panslavist <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and political doctrines. The Learned Sergius Bielokuroff devoted four volumes to the life and works of Krizhanitch. In the seventeenth century there began to be published the first Greco-Latin lexicons, and also the first scientific books, arithmetics and geographies. Historical literature is represented by the chronicle of the Patriarch Nicomachus, which is brought down to 1631; by the chronicle called "Voskresenski", after the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> where it was written, of which the relation finishes with the year 1560; and by several special chronicles, as the account of the siege of the Shrine of St. Sergius by the Poles in 1610, by Abraham Polycin, and by others of the <em>diak</em> Feodor Griboiedoff, of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Timothy Kamevevitch Rvovski, of Andrew Lyzloff, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Smolensk, and of Sergius Kubasoff.
<h2 id="section7">Russian literature of the time of Peter the Great</h2>

<p>Under Peter the Great there began a new period in Russian literature. The foundation of St. Petersburg put <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> in more direct contact with the West. Peter the Great, by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and absolutism, dragged <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> out of her isolation, and directed her upon a new way. A new and more simple alphabet took the place of the old <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> alphabet, the new characters being adapted from the Latin. The first book that was printed with the new characters is a treatise on geometry (1708). In arithmetical books, Arabic figures were substituted for the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> letters that represented numerals (1703). Schools of navigation, of military <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, and of medicine were established. Peter the Great determined to establish an academy of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> at St. Petersburg, and Catherine I carried out his project in 1726. Many foreign books were translated into Russian, and the most intelligent students were sent to foreign countries to complete their studies. Russian literature lost its <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> character and assumed a lay form; and in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> literature itself there was effected a transformation towards the modern, due to the reforms of Peter the Great.

<p>The first period of this new literature begins with Peter the Great, and closes with Lomonosoff and Sumarokoff. In the realm of sacred literature there became famous Stephen Javorski (1658-1723), patriarchal vicar and <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Ryazan, and Theophanus Procopovitch, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Novgorod. (1681-1736). The former, in his "Kamen viery" (Rock of Faith), wrote a most learned refutation of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, taking much from <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>; the second, who was the author of the "Ecclesiastical Regulations" of Peter the Great, wrote a voluminous course of Orthodox <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> in Latin, and acquired fame as a man of letters and orator. In profane literature the influence of the French entirely predominated. There began the period of the new Russian poetry, the rules of which were propounded by Tredianovski (1703-69), who translated into Russian the "Ars Poetica" of Horace, and the work bearing the same title by <a href="../cathen/02623a.htm">Boileau</a>. Prince Antiochus Dmitrievitch (1708-44), a <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumanian</a> in the service of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, inaugurated the era of classicism in Russian poetry with his satires, which are often servile imitations of Horace, Juvenal, and <a href="../cathen/02623a.htm">Boileau</a>. Michael Vasilevitch Lomonosoff (1711-65) deserves to be called the Peter the Great of Russian literature on account of his versatility, of the multiplicity of his works, and of his great literary influence: he wrote a treatise on Russian poetry (1739), on rhetoric (1748), on grammar (1755); he composed an epic poem on Peter the Great, two tragedies (Tamira and Salim, and Damofonte); he translated the Psalms into verse and wrote lyric poems, among which the ode to the Empress Elizabeth has remained famous. Alexander Petrovitch Sumarokoff composed many tragedies, some of them with Russian subjects (Yaropolk and Dimisa, Vysheslaff, Demetrius, Mstislav); he founded the national Russian drama, wrote the comedies "Opekun" (The Tutor), and "Likhoimec" (The Concussionist), composed satires, and in 1759 established the first Russian literary periodical, the "Trudoliubivaia Ptchela" (The Working Bee).

<p>Among the prose writers, Ivan Pososhkoff (1670-1725), in his "Zavieshanie otetcheskoe" (testament of the Fatherland), shows the necessity of well-ordered reforms in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and in his book on poverty and wealth ("Kniga o skudosti i bogatstvie") he develops in an original way his theories on political and social economy. Basil Nikititch Tatishsheff (1685-1750) gathered the chronicles, the <em>synaxaria</em>, and the historical documents, and subjecting them to critical analysis, wrote the "History of Russia". The academician Schl&ouml;tzer spent forty years elucidating the origin and the historical problems of the primitive national chronicles of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. In 1728 the Academy of Sciences began the publication of the "S. Petersburgskija Viedomosti", under the direction of the academician M&uuml;ller, who in 1755 also founded the first scientific-literary periodical, called the "Ezhemiesatchnyja sotchinenia".
<h2 id="section8">Literature of Russia in the eighteenth century</h2>

<p>During the reign of Catherine II French influence upon Russian literature became greater instead of decreasing. The writings of the <a href="../cathen/05418a.htm">French Encyclopedists</a> and materialist philosophy became popular; Voltaire and Rousseau were much esteemed, and Catherine II became entirely imbued with a Voltairean spirit. She did not limit herself to favouring scientific institutions, and to creating new ones, but aspired to literary laurels. She wrote spelling-books, stories for children, letters on <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, comedies, newspaper articles, and several volumes of memoirs in French, in which, with a cynical simplicity of style, she relates some of the ugliest episodes of her unchaste life. During her reign many literary publications were established. The empress herself did not disdain to contribute to the "Vsiakaja vsiatchina" (General Miscellany). Dionysius Ivanovitch Fonvizin (1744-92) wrote comedies which, like the "Brigadier", and the "Nedorosl" (Pupil), became popular in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Gabriel Romanovitch Derzhavin (1743-1816), of Tatar origin, assimilated the classical and modern Literatures, and as a lyric poet sought to rise to the height of Horace and Pindar. His encomiastic odes are an apotheosis of the reign of Catherine II. In his religious songs, with his "Ode to God" (1784), which the Russians regard as the most beautiful monument of their national poetry, he perhaps attains sublimity of inspiration. His moral and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> odes and his Anacreontic verses reveal in him a great poetical genius. His tragedies "Pozharski", "Tiemnji" and "Euprassia" do not join dramatic quality to their elegance of form. Mikhail Matveievitch Kheraskoff, of Wallachian origin, by his poems "Rossiada" and "Vladimir", which have been forgotten, deserves the title of the Virgil or the Homer of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Ippolit Feodorovitch Bogdanovitch (1743-1803), in his poem "Dushenka", imitated La Fontaine's "Amours de Psych&eacute; et de Cupidon". Basil Ivanovitch Maikoff (1728-78) distinguished himself as a writer of comic poetry; Kniazhnin (1742-91) wrote tragedies and comedies; "Iabeda" (The Calumny), a comedy by Kapnist (1757-1828), was also among the plays that became popular.

<p>The scientific movement was greatly promoted by the Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg, by the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, and by the Russian Academy, which was opened in 1783. Among those who distinguished themselves in historical work or in the study of the social and political conditions of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> were Shsherbatoff (1733-90), who wrote six volumes of a "History of Russia"; Boltin (1735-92), whose learned volumes of "Observations on the History of Russia", edited by Leclerc, were much praised by Soloveff; Radishsheff (1749-1802), whose "Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow", describing the miseries of the peasants and the abuses of the Russian bureaucracy cost its author an exile of ten years in <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, Alekseieff, wrote the first <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> encyclopedia, while the Bishop Damascenus Rudneeff, who died in 1795, published his "Russian Library", which contains an account of Russian literature, from its origin to the eighteenth century. Tchulkoff and Mikhail Popoff collected the monuments of the popular literature of their country.
<h2 id="section9">Literature of Russia in the nineteenth century</h2>

<p>In the nineteenth century, Russian literature freed itself little by little from the yoke of foreign imitation, perfected the language, making it a most adequate means for the expression of the highest conceptions of the mind and the most delicate affections of the heart, and through a number of men of genius, won a place of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in the history of universal literature. The merit of this transformation, of this new direction of Russian thought, is in great measure due to Nikolai Mikhailovitch Karamzin (1766-1826), who acquired a great fame in his country through his letters on travels that he made in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, his novels, and the part that he took in the establishment of the periodicals "Moskovski Zhurnal" and the "Viestnik Europy" (Courier of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>). But his greatest claim to glory is the "Istorija gosudarstva rossiiskago" (History of the Russian Empire), a masterpiece of style, exposition, and eloquence, which contributed more than anything else to the formation of Russian prose. Historical criticism may find more to say of this work, but the literary merit of it will never be eclipsed. The work formed a literary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, to which belong Ivan Ivanovitch Dmitrieff (1760-1837), an exponent of elegance in poetry, author of poetical stories, satires, and fables; and Izmailoff, who became famous through his "Journey in Southern <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>" etc. In the realm of dramatic poetry, there became famous Ozeroff, by his tragedy "&OElig;dipus in Athens" (1804); "Fingal" (1805); "Dmitri Donskoi" (1807), and "Polissena" (1809); the most noted satirists were Gortchakoff and Nakhimoff. But the greatest poetical glory of this period was Vassili Andreievitch Zhukovski (1783-1852), the master of romanticism in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, author of the Russian national <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> "Bozhe, carja Khrani", and an indefatigable translator of Homer, Schiller, Goethe, B&uuml;rger, Uhland, R&uuml;kkert, Byron, and Scott. His elegies are full of passion and sentiment; his ballads, imitations of the German, became popular; they reveal in him a vivid poetical <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>.

<p>Ivan Andreievitch Kryloff (1768-1844) owes his celebrity rather to his comedies than to his fables, which, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, are imitations of La Fontaine, but are written with so much simplicity, elegance, and richness of style, with such variety of rhythm and expression, that they form a veritable literary jewel, the value of which can be appreciated only by those who have a thorough <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Russian. His comedies, "Modnaja lavka" (The Custom Shop) and "Urok dotchkam" (A Lesson to Girls), are of less literary merit. As a writer of comedy, Alexander Sergeievitch Griboiedoff (1790-1829) rose to the pinnacle of the art in a play that is the masterpiece of Russian theatrical composition, "Gore ot uma" (The Misfortune of Having Talent), a work which is full of pessimism on the social conditions of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and civilization generally; many of its verses have become proverbs.

<p>The epoch of Nicholas I, which was one of fierce absolutism, was nevertheless one of glory in the development of Russian literature. Russian genius being oppressed, withdrew within itself, and revealed to the world the treasures of the &aelig;sthetic sentiments of the Russian <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Among the greatest poets of this period there stands pre-eminent Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837), whose career was brought to an end in a <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duel</a>, when his genius was at its height. <a href="../cathen/15501b.htm">Melchior Vog&uuml;&eacute;</a> rightly considers him one of the greatest poets that ever lived. He began his literary career at the age of fifteen, when he was a student in the lyceum of Tsarskoye Selo. His first lyric poems bear the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of 1814, and are a revelation of his genius. He adopted Byron and Zhukovski for his models. Among those lyric poems his invective against the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniators</a> of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> ("K klevetnikam Rossii"), written in 1831, is famous. Of his epic works we may cite the famous "Rusalka, the Prisoner of the Caucasus" ("Kavkazski pliennik") in 1821; the "Fountain of Bakhtchiserai" (1822-23); the "Tzigani" (1824); "Poltava" (1828), one of Pushkin's most perfect poems, written in glorification of Peter the Great; "Eugene Oniegin" (1823-31), an original imitation of Byron's "Childe Harold", admirable on account of the freshness of its inspiration and of its exquisite versification; and finally "The Hussar" (1833). Among his romances, three became popular at once, the "Dubrovski (1832-33), "The Daughter of the Captain" (1833-36), and "Pikovaja dama" (The Queen of Spades), a work that is admirable on account of the subtility of its <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> analysis. In the realm of dramatic poetry Pushkin gave to his country a great masterpiece, the tragedy "Boris Godunoff" (1825-31), and in that of drama, "Skupoi rycar" (The Avaricious Knight), "Mozart and Sal&eacute;ry", and "Rusalka". Among his works in prose, mention should be made of the "Outlines of the History of Peter the Great", and of the "History of the Sedition of Pugatcheff". Pushkin was the first great original poet of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and the one who excelled in classic style. At the same time he was the author of a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> that has among its members Ivan Ivanovitch Kozloff, author of two most touching poems, "Tchernec" (The Monk) and "Natalia Dolgorukaja"; Delvin (1798-1831); Jazykoff (1803-46), and Eugene Baratynski (1800-44).

<p>Nikolai Vassilievitch Gogol (1808-52), a native of Little <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, was another genius of the Russian literature of the nineteenth century. His comedy, "The Reviser", published in 1836, is one of the masterpieces of the Russian theatre, a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> portrait of the malversations of the bureaucracy. Among his romances and novels, he acquired merited fame through "Taras Bul'ba", an historical romance of Southern <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, "The Dispute between Ivan Ivanovitch and Ivan Nikiforovitch", "The Portrait", "The Arabesques", "Koliaska" (The Calash), "Zapiski sumasshedshago" (Memoirs of a Madman), and lastly "Mertvyja dushi" (The Dead Souls), in two parts, a masterpiece in the romantic literature of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, which makes its author the rival of Cervantes and Lesage. It is a suggestive and faithful picture of Russian <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>: a vast theatre in which the most varied types of the Russian people are in action. Mikhail Yurievitch Lermontoff (1814-41) is also of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Pushkin and Byron. He was one of the most delicate lyric poets of modern <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, whose lyric poetry, tinged with sadness, touches the deepest chords of the heart, and exhibits the soft melody of the literary language of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> in its fullness. The most famous of his epic poems are "The Demon", which is based upon a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Georgian legend, and in which the beauties of the Caucasus are described in admirable verses "Ismail Bey"; "Khadzhi-Abrek, the Boyard Orsha", an episode of the times of Ivan the Terrible; "Mcyr", a legend of the Caucasus. Lermontoff is the author of the very popular romance "Geroi nashego vremeni" (A Hero of our Times), which reveals him as one of the masters of Russian prose, and as having a profound <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the human heart. He died at the age of twenty-seven years, and like Pushkin, in the plenitude of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> activity. Alexei Vasilievitch Kolcoff (1809-42) also distinguished himself as a lyric poet of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Pushkin and Lermontoff. He was the poet of the peasants and of nature, and the inventor of a special kind of poems (<em>Dumy</em>), in which a question to be resolved is proposed and is answered. Other poets who also were ornaments of Russian literature, although they did not attain the height of those already mentioned, were Odoevski, Count Sollogub, Marlinski, Weltmann, Polevoi, and Kukolnik, a prolific writer of historic dramas.

<p>History, philology, and critical studies had a period of growing prosperity during the reign of Nicholas I. Pogodin, Butkoff, Ivanoff, Venelin, Grigor'eff, and Muravieff worked to defend the Russian chronicles against the charge of lack of authenticity, to throw light on the origin of the Russian nation, and to investigate the historical past of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and the various <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> nations. In the study of the ancient <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> language, and of the primitive literature of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and in the collection of ancient texts, fundamental works that are yet esteemed were written by Kalaidovitch, Vostokoff, Undolski, Kliutchareff, Maximovitch, Certeleff, Snegireff, Sakharoff, and Bodianski. This class of studies were greatly promoted by the Society of Russian History and Antiquities, established at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> in 1814 and still flourishing. Eugene Bolkhovitinoff, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Kieff, prepared two historical lexicons of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> and lay writers of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>; Polevoi, Shevyreff, and Nikitenko wrote histories of Russian literature; while Prince A. Viazemski, Nadezhdin, and especially <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Bessarion</a> Grigorievitch Bielinski (1810-48) were the chief literary critics. Literary and scientific progress was assisted by the periodicals "Viestnik Evropy", "Russki Viestnik", "Syn Otetchestva" (The Son of the Fatherland), "Sievernaja Ptchela" (The Bee of the North), "Russki Invalid", and "Otetchestvennyja zapiski" (Memoirs of the Fatherland).

<p>During the reign of Alexander II the literary genius of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> continued to shine brightly, and to assume always a more national character, although the influence of foreign writers, especially of Dickens, George Sand, and Balzac, was felt. There appeared the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Slavophils, the most illustrious representatives of which are the two Kireievski (Ivan and Peter), Khomiakoff, Valueff, Konstantin and Ivan Aksakoff, Kosheleff, Elagin, Tiuttcheff, Grigorieff, Strakhoff, and Danilevski. This <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was dominated by a spirit of stingy patriotism; it invaded the domain of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, preached the superiority of Orthodoxy over <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of their <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> legislator, Alexei Khomiakoff, a genial poet, historian, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, it proclaimed that Orthodoxy is the expression of the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> ideal of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The religious and political paradoxes of the Slavophils found their opponents in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the Occidentalists (<em>Zapadniki</em>). The <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Tchaadaeff, in his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> letters published in 1836, wrote of Russian barbarity, and proclaimed <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> to be the only means of bringing <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> into the civilization of the nations of the West.

<p>The most illustrious representatives of this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, which had not many followers, were Hercen (1812-70), who became one of the leaders of Nihilism; the poet Ogareff, Granovski, Soloveff, Kavelin, Kalatchoff, and Pavloff, illustrious names in the realms of Russian history and Russian philosophy.

<p>The most famous writer of the time of Alexander II was Ivan Sergeievitch Turgenieff (1818-83), the magician of Russian prose. As a poet his title to fame rests on the poems "Parasha", "Yakoff Pasynkoff", "Rudin", "Faust", "Asja", "A Nest of Nobles". In 1862 he published one of the most famous of Russian novels, "Otcy i dieti" (Fathers and Sons). Among the other novels of Turgenieff, the most successful were "Zapiski Okhotnika" (Memoirs of a Huntsman), rich in admirable descriptions of nature; "Dym" (Smoke); "Nov" (Virgin Soil); and among his stories: "Lear of the Steppe", "Waters of Spring", "The Brigadier", "The Dream", "The Story of Father Alexis", "The Song of Triumphant Love", "The Desperado" etc. He enriched Russian literature with several plays, among which the most beautiful is called "Zavtraku predvoditelja" (The Collation with the Marshal of the Nobility). Ivan Alexandrovitch Gontcharoff (1812-91) acquired no less fame as a novelist through his novels "Obyknovennaja istorija" (A Simple Story), "Oblomoff", which personifies the want of initiative and semi-fatalism of the Russian character, and "Obryff" (The Precipice), which was considered a decadent production. Greater fame was acquired by Feodor Mikhailovitch Dostoievski (1822-81), whose first novel, "Biednye liudi" (Poor People), published in 1846, made its author famous, at once, by the depth of its <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> analysis. After four years of a most painful <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> and exile to <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a>, he wrote the "Zapiski iz Mertvago Doma" (Memoirs of the House of the Dead), in which he describes the tortures of the exiles with a most effective vigour of style; the famous novel "Prestuplenie Nakazanie" (Crime and Punishment), a <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> masterpiece, "The Idiot", "Biezy" (The Possessed), and "The Brothers Karamazoff".

<p>To romantic literature also belong Dimitri Vassilievitch Grigorovitch, an imitator of George Sand, and a faithful portrayer of the sufferings of the lower classes, in his romances and novels, among which we will mention "Derevnia" (The Village), "Anthony Goremyka", "The Valley of Smiedoff", "The Fishermen", and "The Colonists". In other novels he described the life and condition of the middle and higher classes, as in "Neudavshaajasja zhizn" (An Uneventful Life), "Suslikoff the Kapelmeister", "The School of Hospitality", etc. The naturalist <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was represented by Alexei Teofilaktovitch Pisemski (1820-81). In the novel "Bojarshshina" (The Time of the Boyars), he preached free <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: the censorship prohibited the circulation of the book. In another novel, "Tiufiak" (The Plaster), his realism goes beyond that of Zola. His best novel is "Tysjatcha dush" (A Thousand Souls), a gloomy but faithful picture of the corruption of Russian <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, which is portrayed also in his novel "Vzgalamutchennoe More" (Tempestuous Sea); his novel "Liudi sokorovykh godoff" (Men of Forty Years) deals with the agrarian question. His play "Gorkaja sudhina" (Bitter Destiny) places him in a high position among Russian dramatists. Other writers proposed to scourge the corrupters of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, to pierce them with the arrows of their satire. They form a literary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> known in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> as <em>oblitchitel naja</em> (accusing, refuting). The master of this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was Mikhail Evgrafovitch Saltykoff (1826-88), better known by the pseudonym of Shshedrin. The characters in his novels recall those of Gogol, but his pessimism is much more bitter and exaggerated. Among the best-known of his novels and other writings are "Protivorietckia" (Contradictions), "Gubernskie otcherki" (Sketches of Government Personages), "Tashkency" (The Lords of Tashkend), and "The Brothers Golovieff", a novel that is considered the best work of Saltykoff, but is displeasing on account of the cynicism of its characters. Other writers worked with the same end of laying bare the moral and social defects of the Russian people; the most famous among them are Pomialovski (1835-63), whose novel "Otcherki bursy" is famous; it describes in dark colours the methods of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> that obtain in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminaries</a> of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>; A. Sliepcoff, author of the novel "Trudnoe Vremja" (Difficult Times); A. Mikhailoff, the pseudonym of Scheller, who wrote the novels "Gnilyja bolota" (Putrid Swamps), and "The Life of Shupoff"; Zasodimski; Bazhin; Thedoroff; Staniukovitch; and Girs. More moderate in their criticism of Russian <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> were the novelists Boborykin, Markoff, Nemirovitch-Dantchenko, and Terpigoreff (better known by his pseudonym of Atava), Saloff, Akhsharumoff, Leikin, Kliushnikoff, Lieskoff, Krestovski, Prince Meshsherki, Markevitch, Avsieensko, Golovin, and Avenarius.

<p>The most noted authors of lyric and satirical poetry were: Nikolai Alexeievitch Nekrasoff (1821-76), whose muse, as he himself wrote, was one of sobs and pains, the muse of the hungry and the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant</a>; of his songs, there became famous "Moroz Krasnyi Noz" (Red-nosed Frost), a personification of the Russian winter, "Troika", and "The Sons of the Peasants"; in his poems he has a predilection for popular types; A. Pleshsheeff, who to his lyric poems added beautiful translations of the principal German and English lyric poets; Kurotchkin, who translated B&eacute;ranger, and Minaeff. The most noted of the dramatists was Alexander Nicolaevitch Ostrovski (1823-86), whose theatrical compositions, admirable for the richness of their language, are partly original, and partly imitations of <a href="../cathen/13748c.htm">Shakespeare</a> and Goldoni. The best known one is "Groza" (The Tempest), which describes the dissolution of the Russian <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; it was written in 1860. Two of his comedies that obtained great success are "We will agree among ourselves", and "Each one in his place". The number of his theatrical works is very great. Another among the best of Russian dramatists was A. Palm (1822-85), author of the drama "Alexis Slobodin", and of the comedies "Staryi barin" (The Old Lord), and "Our Friend Nekliuzheff". Mention should be made also of A. Potiekhin, N. Tchernysheff, N. Soloveff, Sukhovo-Kobylin, Sollogub, Diakonoff, Ustrialoff, Mann, Diatchenko, Shpazhinski, and Kryloff. <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Women</a> also distinguished themselves in the literary life of the nineteenth century. The best known among those who wrote poetry and novels were Elizabeth Kulmann, <a href="../cathen/13687a.htm">Countess Rostoptchina</a>, N. Khboshshinska (1825-89), who under the pseudonym of Krestovski wrote many novels to describe provincial life; Sokhanska (1825-84), who under the pseudonym of Kokhanovska acquired celebrity through her novels "After Dinner Among the Guests" and "Provincial Portrait Gallery".

<p>Among the writers who became distinguished in the realm of historical fiction were N. Kostomaroff, whose story "The Son" (1865) presents a vigorous picture of the agrarian revolt of Stenko Razin; Count Alexi Tolstoi (1817-75) achieved fame with his novel "Prince Serebrany", and his trilogy "Ivan the Terrible" (1858), "Tsar Feodor Ivanovitch" (1868), and "Tsar Boris" (1869); G. Danilevski, author of the novels "Mirovitch" (1879), "The Fire of Moscow" (1885-86), and "Tchernyi god" (The Black Year); Mordovceff, whose novels "Demetrius the Tsarevitch" and "Fall of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>" deal with the history of Little <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>; Karnovitch, Salias-de-Tournemir, Mei (1822-62), author of several historical dramas based upon the primitive history of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>; and finally Averkieff. Among the lyric poets who did not treat of the social conditions of their country, who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> their art for its own sake, the most famous are A. Tolstoi, an imitator of <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>, Heine, and Goethe; Maikoff, a passionate admirer of ancient <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the struggle of which with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> he essayed to depict in his tragedy "Dva mira" (Two Worlds); A. Feth, author of light poems and madrigals; Polonski, whose poem "Kuznievitch-Muzykant" (The Musical Cricket) became popular, and whose poetry is distinguished by the beauty of its style and the harmony of its verse; Zhadovski, Shsherbin, Herbel, Weinberg, and Nadsohn.
<h2 id="section10">Contemporary Russian literature</h2>

<p>The literature from the death of Alexander II to the present day is essentially one of novels. The novel, in view of the severity of Russian censorship, seems to be the most adequate literary channel for the diffusion of political, social, and moral theories. The most salient character of all the writers of the reign of Alexander II, and of more recent times by the force of his genius and the sharpness of his <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> analysis, was Count Lyeff (Leo) Tolstoi, born at Yasnaja Poliana, 28 Aug., 1828; died at Astapovo, 20 Nov., 1910. He inaugurated his literary career by the publication of his autobiographical memoirs, which appeared in the "Sovremennik" of St. Petersburg in 1852; they are a masterpiece of <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> analysis of the mind of a child. This work was followed by "Adolescence", "Youth"," The Cossacks", and "Recollections of Sebastopol", all of which are filled with horror of the sights he beheld at Sebastopol. But the masterpieces among his novels are "War and Peace", a powerful romance that for all its apparent confusion and disorder is an epic and imposing picture of the Napoleonic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>; "Anna Karenina", a profound analysis of the feminine <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that, led astray by passion, forgets dignity and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> for <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and finds its punishment in its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; "Resurrection", a novel that is a study of the rehabilitation of the culprit. There is also the play "The Power of Darkness", strong in its vigour and dramatization. And yet this genius, who made Russian literature popular all over the world, attained religious, <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a>, and political nihilism: in the "Kreutzer Sonata" he preaches the abjection of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; "The Gospels" is a criticism of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>, while "My Religion", "The Church and the State", and "The Theories of the Apostles" strip <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> revelation from its base, and forswear the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and His <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; in the book "What is Art?", he disparages the most illustrious intellects of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; his work "The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a> is Within You" preaches non-resistance to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Political and religious conceptions took Tolstoi out of his orbit, and transformed him into a visionary, an incendiary, so to speak, of all institutions, Divine and human.

<p>Among the other modern novelists, mention should be made of: A. Novodvorski, author of "Ni pavy, Ni Vorony" (Neither Peacock nor Crow), and of other stories; B. Garshin, who in his principal novels is sometimes a follower of Tolstoi and sometimes of Turgenieff. Those works are "Tchetyre dnja" (The Four Days), "Trus" (The Coward), "Krasnyj cvietok" (The Red Flower), "Attalea princeps", "Vstrietcha" (The Encounter), and "Nadezhda Nikolaevna"; I. Yasinski was famous under the pseudonym of Maxim Bielinski; his most important works are "The City of the Dead", and "The Guiding Star"; M. Alboff; K. Barantchevitch; A. Ertel; Matchtet; Korolenko, a beautiful story-teller, who reminds his readers of Dostoievski and Tolstoi in his novels "The Dream of Macarius" (a fantastic story), "The Sketches of a Tourist in Siberia", "Easter Night," "The Old Music Player", and "S dvukh storon" (Two Points of View); Ignatius Potapenko, who views life in the light of optimism, and not with the pessimism so much in vogue among Russian writers; one of his novels, "Sviatoe iskusstvo", describes the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> of the students of St. Petersburg; Demetrius Mamin, under the pseudonym of <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberian</a>, describes the customs of Western Siberia; and finally <a href="../cathen/06367b.htm">Prince Galitzin</a>. Among novelists of the new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> are Anton Pavlovitch Tchehoff (1860-1904), whose novel "Skutchnaja istorija" had a great success. He is without a superior in the narrative of his novels; the heroes of his stories are always morally corrupt, and of distracted <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a>. Alexei Maksimovitch Pieshkoff, better known by the pseudonym of Maxim Gorky (born 1869); he is the novelist of the beggars and the populace, whose works contain pages of nauseating <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">naturalism</a>, and shameful immorality. Vincent Smidlvski, born at Tula, 1867; under the pseudonym of Veresaeff he came to celebrity through his work "Zapiski vratcha" (Memoirs of a Doctor), which elicited violent recriminations in the medical profession. One of the most famous of the Russian writers of the present day is Leonid Andreeff, born at Orel in 1881. He is the novelist of the degenerate. His novels "The Red Laughter", "The Thought", "The Cloud", "Silence", etc. are to be condemned from every point of view, religious and moral, and the Russian religious press has blamed him for them in vehement language.

<p>Among writers of the present day mention should be made of Sofija Ivanovna Smirnova, who wrote the novels "Salt of the Earth" and "Force of Character"; Valentine Dmitrieva, writer of stories; Olga Andreevna Shapir, who wrote "Without Love", and "Tinsel"; Lydja Veselitskaja, Alexandra Shabelskaja, Anastasia Verbickaja, who wrote "The History of a Life". Among those who achieved fame as lyric poets are Simon Frug (of Jewish origin), Nikolai Maksimovitch Vilenkin, famous under the pseudonym of Minski, Dimitri Merezhkovski, whose poems have the defect of too much rhetorical effort; Alexei Apukhtin, Konstantin Rozanoff, Arsenius Golenishsheff-Kutuzoff, Sergei Andreevski, etc. These poets, however, are not original; their works recall too much the great poets who preceded them. The fiction of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> generally uses, as a channel of publication, the literary periodicals, among which some that were famous in the nineteenth century have now disappeared, as the "Sovremennik" (The Contemporary), the "Otetchestvennyja Zapiski", and the "Moskvitjanin". The best-known of those that are yet published are the "Viestnik Evropy", and the "Pycck mysl".

<p>The historical literature of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> in the second half of the nineteenth century furnishes illustrious names. Sergei Soloveff is the author of a "History of Russia", in thirty volumes, which begins with the most ancient times, and terminates with the reign of Alexander I; it is a work of greater historical than literary merit; Zabielin devoted his studies by preference to the <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; A. Nikitski wrote on the historical past of Novgorod and Pskof; Kostomaroff wrote on Little <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>; the historical monographs of this author are held in high esteem, as also his "History of Russia", composed of biographical narratives. Pypin devoted his researches to the reign of Alexander I; Shsapoff studied the social and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> development of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>; Br&uuml;ckner dealt with the life of Peter the Great; Bestuzheff-Riumin wrote a classic history of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and Biblasoff a life of Catharine II. We cannot name the great number of historians who, like Ilovaiski, <a href="../cathen/08760a.htm">Lambin</a>, Kliutchevski, Golubinski, etc. have thrown light on the history of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, but we cannot omit to mention the Imperial Historical Society of St. Petersburg, the Archeographic Commission, and the Society of Russian History and Antiquity of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, which, with hundreds of learned publications, and especially of the Russian chronicles, have greatly facilitated the task of the student. Yushkevitch, Yakushkin, Metlinski, Ribnikoff, Khudiakoff, and Barsoff distinguished themselves in the collection of ancient Russian literary documents, upon which light was thrown by Buslaeff, Miller, Stasoff, Maikoff, Kolosoff, Rozoff, Dashkevitch, Vselovski, and above all Sreznevski, who for several years edited the "Izviestija", and the "Utchenyja Zapiski" of St. Petersburg (Academy of Sciences). Buslaeff, with his "Historical Chrestomathy", wove together the literary annals of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Pekarski related the scientific and literary transactions of Peter the Great, Pypin and Porfireff wrote full and classic histories of the literature of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Special works on the greatest Russian writers are so numerous that the "Bibliography of the Russian Literature of the Nineteenth Century", ed. Mezier, St. Petersburg, 1902, devotes 650 octavo pages to the titles of those works alone.

<p>In philosophy Russian works until now have not been original. They have been produced under the supreme influence of German philosophy, inspired by <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>, <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a>, and Schelling. Positivism, <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">Materialism</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14229a.htm">Spiritualism</a> have succeeded each other without developing originality. Galitch, professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at St. Petersburg (died 1848), was an <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheist</a>; Davidoff (died 1862) reduced philosophy to <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a> alone. The philosophy of Schelling influenced even <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers, as Skvorcoff and the <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrite</a> Theophanus Avseneff. Orest. Novicki is a convinced partisan of the system of Fichte; he was a professor of the University of Kieff. <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegelianism</a>, however, was the most popular of all, and was at once accepted by the Occidentalists Stankevitch, Granovski, Bielinski, and Ogareff, and by the Slavophiles Kirieevski, Khomjakoff, Samarin, and Aksakoff. Between 1859 and 1873 Professor Gogocki of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> academy of Kieff published his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> dictionary. The materialist theories of Moleschott and B&uuml;chner were defended by M. Antonovitch and D. Pisareff, and refuted by Yurkevitch, Strakhoff, Kudriavceff, Samarin, and Viadislaveff. Darwinism found defenders in Timiriazeff and Famincyn, and opponents in Troicki, Dokutchaeff, Guseff, Popoff, and Strakhoff. The Positivism of Comte was upheld by de Roberti and Mikhailovski. The most original <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> were: Kavelin (1818-85), who dealt more especially with <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> problems, an historian and profound <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychologist</a>, to whom <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> owes the establishment of the "Voprosy filosofii i psikhologii", a periodical devoted to philosophy, which is held in very high esteem; Kudriavceff-Platonoff, who excels in religious philosophy, and whose studies in <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a> are admirable for their vigour and power of argument; Vladimir Soloveff, an ardent defender of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principles in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and a spiritual <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, the most eminent that <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> has produced. His extensive treatise on ethics, "Opravdanie dobra" (Justification of the Good), is a masterpiece of speculation; Prince Troubetzkoi, a follower of Soloveff; and finally, Nesmieloff, professor of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> academy of Kazan, whose work "The Science of Man" gives to him the first place among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> at the present time.
