<h1>Ruthenian Rite</h1>  

<p>There is, properly speaking, no separate and distinct rite for the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, but inasmuch as the name is often used for the modifications which the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> have introduced in the Byzantine or <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> as used by them, a brief description is proper. These modifications have come about in two ways. In the first place, the ancient Slavonic <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">missals</a> used in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and in Little <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> (Ruthenia) differed in many instances from the Greek as used at Constantinople, and the correction of these differences by the <a href="../cathen/11077b.htm">Patriarch Nikon</a> gave rise to the Old Ritualists (see <a href="../cathen/12648b.htm">RASKOLNIKS</a>). When, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> came into union with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in 1595, they brought with them in their <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> several of the usages and formulae which <a href="../cathen/11077b.htm">Nikon</a> afterwards corrected at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>. Where these differences presented no denial or contradiction of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> allowed them to remain, just as they have allowed the rites of many <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. In the second place, after the union had become a fixed fact, numbers of the Polish Latin <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> seemed to find in the Greek ceremonies and forms of language some apparent contradictions of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as more fully elaborated in the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>. This seemed to them to indicate a lack of unity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Greek Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the Synod of Zamosc (1720) made a number of changes in the Byzantine Rite, particularly that of the Mass, so as more clearly to express the unity and identity of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with that of their brethren of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>. These changes are sometimes bitterly spoken of by Russian authors as "latinizing", and the majority of them were probably unnecessary. When we consider that the <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a>, Rumanians, and Italo-Greeks have kept the old forms thus unchanged, it does not seem that they were required in order to express the complete unity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Nevertheless they were sufficient to cause them to be spoken of as the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Rite, as distinguished from the older form of the Byzantine Rite (See RITE OF CONSTANTINOPLE; <a href="../cathen/06744a.htm">GREEK CATHOLICS IN AMERICA</a>; <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">GREEK CHURCH</a>).

<p>The chief modifications introduced were the addition of the <em>Filioque (i ot Syna)</em> to the Creed, and the commemoration of "the holy universal Chief Bishop N. the Pope of Rome", in the <em>Ektene</em> and in the general commemoration at the Great Entrance; while the emphasis laid on the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> (invocation) may be said to also constitute a difference from the Orthodox Rite. The addition of the <em>Filioque</em> is not required even in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, for at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the Creed is still said in Greek without it; but there it is simply an ancient custom and no indication of any difference in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. As to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the various Orthodox Churches of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and Eastern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> have never hesitated to change the Byzantine liturgy in order to insert <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the Holy Synod, imperial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, etc., even carrying them out to great length. The <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> however differ from the other Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> nationalities and from the Orthodox churches in many other peculiarities of rite.

<p>In the <em>Proskomide</em> of the Divine Liturgy the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> are allowed to prepare for Mass with one altar-bread (<em>prosphora</em>) or with three, or even with the dry <em>Agnetz</em> (the square Greek host) if no <em>prosphorae</em> can be had, instead of requiring five <em>prosphorae</em>. Then too the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may omit the full number of particles to be placed on the <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a>, and may place only one for the various ranks he is required to commemorate, or in exceptional cases where there are no particles "the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may celebrate with the Agnetz alone" (Decretum Syn. Leopoliensis, p. 83). The number of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to be commemorated has also been cut down to a few principal names. When the Mass of the Catechumens or public part of the Divine Liturgy begins, the Royal Doors of the Iconostasis are thrown wide open and continue so during the entire Mass. There are no <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> directing them to be open and shut during the service, nor is there any veil to be drawn. Formerly this was the practise in the old Slavonic Churches and Missals, and is still followed in the Court Church until after the Great Entrance is completed. The custom of reverencing during the singing of the <em>Edinorodny Syne (Filius unigenitus)</em> and the Creed at the word <em>voheloviechshasia (Homo factus est)</em> and the addition of the <em>i ot Syna (Filioque)</em> were adopted to conform to the practice of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>. The same may be said of the practice of covering the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> while on the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>, and this in turn has made the <em>ripidia</em> or fans disappear as altar utensils. In the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of contrition before communion the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> strikes his breast three times as in the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>. Among the special modifications in the Liturgy by the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> is the order of the <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>. The three week-day <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, Psalms xci, xcii, xciv, are introduced directly into the text of the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, while on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> in their stead (when there is no <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast-day</a> having special <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>) Psalms lxv, lxvi, and xciv take their place. The <em>Typika</em>, Psalms cii and cxlv, as well as the <em>Blazhenni (beatitudes)</em> are not said except in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and monastic churches. At the recital of the Creed the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> holds up the <em>a&euml;r</em> without moving it to and fro. Just before the ante-communion <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> performs an ablution of the tips of his fingers. The <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> do not add hot water to the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> after the Fraction, as all other Greeks do, for this was abolished by the Synod of Zamosc (tit. iii, sec. iv). They have also abolished the use of the sponge in purifying the <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a> and <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, and use instead the finger for the <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a> and a veil on the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>. A final ablution is introduced, and the holy vessels remain on the altar until the Mass is finished, instead of being carried to the side altar (prothesis) as in the Byzantine Rite. The absence of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Mass will be particularly noticed, for that is the rule except in cases of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> Masses or pontifical Masses, corresponding to the usages of the Roman solemn high Mass, and then the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> is usually a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who reverts to his former order. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> among the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> is now chiefly a grade to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and not a permanent order for <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> work. There is no distribution of the <em>antidoron</em> or blessed bread at the end of Mass in the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Rite. Nor do they have the custom of giving communion (by a tiny drop from the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>) to infants and children under four years, as in the Russian <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> among the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> usually follow the Roman rule and are shaven, unlike the general rule among the Greek <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of other countries, whether <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or Orthodox. They do not wear the <em>kamilafka</em> or straight cylindrical Greek <a href="../cathen/02577a.htm">biretta</a>, but have invented for themselves a round headpiece or crown, something like the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> of a Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and they also wear the close-fitting cassock of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, instead of the loose robe with flowing sleeves used by the Greeks of other countries.
