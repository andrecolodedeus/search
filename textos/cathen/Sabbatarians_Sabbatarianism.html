<h1>Sabbatarians, Sabbatarianism</h1>  

<p>(Hebrew <em>Shabot</em> rest).

<p>The name, as appears from its origin, denotes those <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> or parties who are distinguished by some peculiar opinion or practice in regard to the observance of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> or day of rest. In the first place it is applied to those rigorists who apparently confound the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Christian Sunday</a> with the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Jewish Sabbath</a> and, not content with the prohibition of servile work, will not allow many ordinary and innocent occupations on the Sunday. This form of Sabbatariansm has chiefly prevailed among Scottish and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and was at one time very common. Of late years it has sensibly declined; and there is now a tendency towards the opposite extreme of laxity in observing the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of Sunday rest. These Sabbatarians never formed a distinct <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>; but were merely a party of rigorists scattered among many and various <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>. At the same time it is not only in their name that they have something in common with the distinctive <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> of Sabbatarians properly so-called, for their initial <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in neglecting the distinction between the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Christian weekly festival</a> and the Jewish <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> is likewise the starting-point of the Sabbatarian <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>; and these carry their mistaken principle to its <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> conclusion.

<p>This <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> development of judaizing Sabbatarianism is curiously illustrated in the history of a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of Sabbatarian <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinians</a> founded in <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> towards the end of the sixteenth century. Their first principle, which led them to separate from the rest of the <a href="../cathen/15154b.htm">Unitarian</a> body, was their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that the day of rest must be observed with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> on the seventh day of the week and not on the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Christian Sunday</a>. And as we learn from Schrodl the greater part of this particular Sabbatarian <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> joined the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in 1874, thus carrying out in practice the judaizing principle of their founders. Although there does not seem to be any immediate or obvious connection between the observance of the seventh day and the rejection of infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, these two <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and discipline are often found together. Thus Sabbatarianism made many recruits among the <a href="../cathen/10190b.htm">Mennonite Anabaptists</a> in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and among the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptists</a> who, much as they differ on other points of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, agree in the rejection of paedo-baptism. And it is presumably a result of this contact with <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptism</a> that Sabbatarianism is also found in association with fanatical views on political or social questions. The most conspicuous of English Sabbatarian <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptists</a> was Francis Bampfield (d. 1683), brother of a Devonshire baronet and originally a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> of the English Church. He was the author of several works and ministered to a congregation of Sabbatarian <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptists</a> in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. He suffered <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> for his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heterodoxy</a> and eventually died in Newgate. In America the <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptists</a> who profess Sabbatarianism are known as Seventh-Day <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptists</a>.

<p>But if the greater number of Sabbatarians have come from the <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptists</a>, the most amazing of them was at one time associated with the Wesleyan <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodists</a>. This was the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophetess</a> Joanna Southcott (1750-1814), like Bampfield, a native of Devonshire, who composed many spiritual poems and prophetical writings, and became the mother of a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of Sabbatarians, also known as Southcottians or Joannas. Modern Englishmen who are apt to smile at <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> credulity can scarcely find in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries in the "darkest" days of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> any instance of a more amazing credulity than that of Joanna Southcott's disciples, who confidently awaited the birth of the promised <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiah</a> whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophetess</a> of sixty-four was to bring into the world. They gave practical <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by preparing a costly cradle. Nor did they abandon all hope when the poor deluded <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> died of the disease which had given a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> appearance of pregnancy. The <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> survived for many years; and when in 1874 her tombstone was shattered by an accidental explosion, the supposed portent re-enkindled the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of her followers.

<p>The American <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of <a href="../cathen/01166a.htm">Seventh-Day Adventists</a> may be added to the list of Sabbatarian communities, among which their large numbers should give them a conspicuous place. To these may be added the Jewish <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of Sabbatarians, though these derive their name not from the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, but from their founder, Sabbatian Zebi or Zevi (1626-76). His teaching was not concerned with any special observance of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, but as a form of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> Messianism it may be compared with the mission of Joanna Southcott. The two stories show some strange points of resemblance especially in the invincible credulity of the disciples of the pretended Jewish <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiah</a> and of the deluded Devonshire <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophetess</a>.
