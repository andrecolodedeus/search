<h1>Sabbatine Privilege</h1>  

<p>The name <em>Sabbatine Privilege</em> is derived from the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Sacratissimo uti culmine" of <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, 3 March, 1322. In this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is made to declare that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> appeared to him, and most urgently recommended to him the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite Order</a> and its <em>confratres</em> and <em>consorores</em>. The <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> asked that <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John</a>, as <a href="../cathen/15403b.htm">Christ's representative on earth</a>, should ratify the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> which He had already granted in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> (a plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> for the members of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite Order</a> and a partial <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, remitting the third part of the temporal punishment due to their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for the members of the <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a>); she herself would graciously descend on the Saturday (<a href="../cathen/13287b.htm"><em>Sabbath</em></a> after their death and liberate and conduct to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> all who were in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>. Then follow the conditions which the <em>confratres</em> and <em>consorores</em> must fulfill. At the end of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> declares:

<blockquote><p>Istam ergo sanctam Indulgentiam accepto, roboro et in terris confirmo, sicut, propter merita Virginis Matris, gratiose Jesus Christus concessit in coelis

<p>(This <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> I therefore accept; I confirm and ratify it on earth, just as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> has graciously granted it in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> on account of the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mother</a>). </p></blockquote>

<p>Our first information of this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> is derived from a work of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Balduinus Leersius ("Collectaneum exemplorum et miraculorum" in "Bibliotheca Carmelit.", I, <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, 1752, p. 210), who died in 1483. The <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authenticity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> was keenly contested especially in the seventeenth century, but was vigorously defended by the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>. The chief opponents of its <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authenticity</a> were Joannes Launoy and the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandist</a>, Daniel Papebroch, both of whom published works against it. Today it is universally regarded by scholars as inauthentic, even the "Monumenta histor. Carmel." of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> B. Zimmerman (I, L&eacute;rins, 1907, pp. 356-63) joining in rejecting it.

<p>In 1379, in consequence of the hostility still shown to their order and especially to its name, the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> besought <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a> to grant an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of 3 years and 3 <a href="../cathen/12593a.htm">quarantines</a> to all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who designated them and their order "Ordinem et Fratres B. Mariae Genetricis Dei de Monte Carmeli" (Bullar. Carmelit. I, 141); this was granted by <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban</a> on 26 April, 1379. It is difficult to understand why, instead of asking for this <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, they did not appeal to the old promise and the recent "Bulla sabbatina", if the <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> was then known and the promise to <a href="../cathen/13800a.htm">St. Simon Stock</a> and this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> were genuine and incontestable. While the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> was ratified by some later <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> in the sixteenth century (cf. Bullar. Carmelit., II, 47, 141), neither the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> itself in its wording nor its general contents were thereby declared <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authentic</a> and genuine. On the contrary, the ratification by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> on 18 September, 1577 (Bullar. Carmelit., II, 196), must be interpreted quite in the sense of the later <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Holy Office. This <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a>, which appeared in 1613, expresses no opinion concerning the genuineness of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, but confines itself to declaring what the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> may preach of its contents. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> forbids the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of pictures representing, in accordance with the wording of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> descending into <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> (cum descensione beatae Virginis ad animas in Purgatorio liberandas). It must be also remembered that the latest <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authentic</a> summary of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite Order</a> of 31 July, 1907 (<a href="../cathen/01111c.htm">Acta S. Sedis</a>, XL, 753 sqq.), approved by the Congregation of Indulgences, says nothing either of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> granted by him, or of the Sabbatine privilege of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>. To learn the meaning and importance of the Sabbatine privilege, we may turn only to the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Holy Office. It was inserted in its entirety (except for the words forbidding the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of the pictures) into the list of the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> and <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privileges</a> of the Confraternity of the Scapular of Mount Carmel.

<p>We reproduce here the whole passage dealing with the Sabbatine privilege, as it appears in the summary approved by the Congregation of Indulgences on 4 July, 1908. It is noteworthy that the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, which was still mentioned in the previous summary approved on 1 December, 1866, is no longer referred to (cf. "Rescript. authent. S.C. Indulg.", Ratisbon, 1885, p. 475). Among the <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privileges</a>, which are mentioned after the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, the following occurs in the first place: "The <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a> of <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a>, commonly [<em>vulgo</em>] known as the Sabbatine, which was approved and confirmed by <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> ("Ex clementi", 12 August 1530), <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a> ("Superna dispositione", 18 Feb., 1566), <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> ("Ut laudes", 18 Sept., 1577), and others, and also by the Holy Roman General <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> under <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> on 20 January, 1613, in a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> to the following effect:

<blockquote><p>It is permitted to the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite Fathers</a> to preach that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people may piously <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the help which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of brothers and members, who have departed this life in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, have worn in life the <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a>, have ever observed <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, have recited the <a href="../cathen/09294a.htm">Little Hours [of the Blessed Virgin]</a>, or, if they cannot read, have observed the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a> days of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and have <a href="../cathen/01067a.htm">abstained</a> from flesh meat on Wednesdays and Saturdays (except when <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> falls on such days), may derive after death &#151; especially on Saturdays, the day <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> &#151; through the unceasing <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, her <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> petitions, her <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, and her special protection. </p></blockquote>

<p>With this explanation and interpretation, the Sabbatine privilege no longer presents any difficulties, and <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> adds his desire that the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> should rely on it (Opera omnia, IX, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1767, pp. 197 sqq.). Even apart from the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> and the tradition or <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">legend</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">apparition</a> and promise of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> the interpretation of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> cannot be contested.

<p>The Sabbatine privilege thus consists essentially in the early liberation from <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, through the special <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a> and petition of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, which she graciously exercises in favour of her <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devoted</a> servants preferentially &#151; as we may assume &#151; on the day <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to her, Saturday. Furthermore, the conditions for the gaining of the privilege are of such a kind as justify a special trust in the assistance of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>. It is especially required of all who wish to share in the privilege that they faithfully preserve their <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and recite devoutly each day the <a href="../cathen/09294a.htm">Little Hours of the Blessed Virgin</a>. However, all those who are bound to read their <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, fulfil the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of reciting the <a href="../cathen/09294a.htm">Little Hours</a> by reading their <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a>. <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Persons</a> who cannot read must (instead of reciting the <a href="../cathen/09294a.htm">Little Hours</a>) observe all the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as they are kept in their home <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> or place of residence, and must in addition <a href="../cathen/01067a.htm">abstain</a> from flesh meat on all Wednesdays and Saturdays of the year, except when <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> falls on one of these days. The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to read the <a href="../cathen/09294a.htm">Little Hours</a> and to <a href="../cathen/01067a.htm">abstain</a> from flesh meat on Wednesday and Saturday may on important grounds be changed for other <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> works; the faculty to sanction this change was granted to all confessors by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Congregation of Indulgences of 11 (14) June, 1901.
