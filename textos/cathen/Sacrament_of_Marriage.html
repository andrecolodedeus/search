<h1>Sacrament of Marriage</h1>  

<p>That <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> marriage (i.e. marriage between <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>) is really a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the New Law in the strict sense of the word is for all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> an indubitable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. According to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> this <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> has always been taught by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and is thus <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> in canon i, Sess. XXIV: "If any one shall say that matrimony is not truly and properly one of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Seven Sacraments</a> of the Evangelical Law, instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ our Lord</a>, but was invented in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and does not confer grace, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>." The occasion of this <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> declaration was the denial by the so-called <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">sacramental character</a> of marriage. <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> in his "Institutions", IV, xix, 34, says: "Lastly, there is matrimony, which all admit was instituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though no one before the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> regarded it as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. What man in his sober senses could so regard it? <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> ordinance is good and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>; so also are agriculture, architecture, shoemaking, hair-cutting legitimate ordinances of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but they are not <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>". And <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> speaks in terms equally vigorous. In his German work, published at <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> in 1530 under the title "Von den Ehesachen", he writes (p. 1): "No one indeed can deny that marriage is an external worldly thing, like clothes and food, house and home, subject to worldly authority, as shown by so many imperial <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> governing it." In an earlier work (the original edition of "De captivitate Babylonica") he writes: "Not only is the <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">sacramental character</a> of matrimony without foundation in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>; but the very <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">traditions</a>, which claim such sacredness for it, are a mere jest"; and two pages further on: "Marriage may therefore be a figure of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; it is, however, no Divinely instituted <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but the invention of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, arising from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the subject." The Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> evidently had the latter passage in mind.

<p>But the decision of <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> was not the first given by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> for the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, had already declared: "The seventh <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is matrimony, which is a figure of the union of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, according to the words of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a>: This is a great <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but I speak in Christ and in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.'" And <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, in the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> prescribed for the <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldensians</a> (18 December, 1208), includes matrimony among the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, "Enchiridion", n. 424). The acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> administered in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had been prescribed in general in the following words: "And we by no means reject the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which are administered in it (the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic Church</a>), with the co-operation of the inestimable and invisible power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, even though they be administered by a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, provided the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> recognizes him", the formula then takes up each <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in particular, touching especially on those points which the <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldensians</a> had denied: "Therefore we approve of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of children . . . <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">confirmation</a> administered by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> . . . the <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">sacrifice of the Eucharist</a>. . . . We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that pardon is granted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to penitent sinners . . . we hold in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the anointing of the sick with <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> oil . . . we do not deny that carnal marriages are to be contracted, according to the words of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a>." It is, therefore, <a href="../cathen/07635a.htm">historically</a> <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that from the beginning of the thirteenth century the <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">sacramental character</a> of marriage was universally <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and recognized as a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. Even the few <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> who minimized, or who seemed to minimize, the <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">sacramental character</a> of marriage, set down in the foremost place the proposition that marriage is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the New Law in the strict sense of the word, and then sought to conform their further theses on the effect and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of marriage to this fundamental <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as will be evident from the quotations given below.

<p>The reason why marriage was not expressly and formally included among the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> earlier and the denial of it branded as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, is to be found in the historical development of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> regarding the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; but the fact itself may be traced to <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">Apostolic</a> times. With regard to the several religious <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> designated as "Sacraments of the New Law", there was always in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> a profound conviction that they conferred interior <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>. But the grouping of them into one and the same category was left for a later period, when the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in general began to be scientifically examined and systematically arranged. Furthermore, that the seven <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> should be grouped in one category was by no means self-evident. For, though it was accepted that each of these <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> conferred interior grace, yet, in contrast to their common invisible effect, the difference in external <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> and even in the immediate purpose of the production of grace was so great that, for a long time, it hindered a uniform classification. Thus, there is a radical difference between the external <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> under which <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">confirmation</a>, and orders, on the one hand are administered, and, on the other hand, those that characterize penance and marriage. For while marriage is in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a>, and penance in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a judicial process, the three first-mentioned take the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> of a religious <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the recipients.


<h2 id="section1">Proof of sacramental character of Christian marriage</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">Apostolicity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that marriage is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the New Law, it will suffice to show that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has in fact always taught concerning marriage what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. The name <em>sacrament</em> cannot be cited as satisfactory evidence, since it did not acquire until a late period the exclusively technical meaning it has today; both in pre-Christian times and in the first centuries of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a> it had a much broader and more indefinite signification. In this sense is to be understood the statement of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in his <a href="../cathen/01687e.htm">Encyclical "Arcanum"</a> (10 February, 1880): "To the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, indeed, are to be referred the doctrines which our holy fathers, the councils, and the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Universal</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> have always taught, namely that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Our Lord</a> raised marriage to the dignity of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>." The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> rightly emphasizes the importance of the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Universal</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Without this it would be very difficult to get from the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptures</a> and the Fathers clear and decisive <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> for all, even the unlearned, that marriage is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in the strict sense of the word. The process of demonstration would be too long and would require a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> which the ordinary <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> do not possess. In themselves, however, the direct testimonies of the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptures</a> and of several of the Fathers are of sufficient weight to constitute a real <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, despite the denial of a few <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> past and present.

<p>The classical <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptural</a> text is the declaration of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#vrs22">Ephesians 5:22 sqq.</a>), who emphatically declares that the relation between husband and wife should be as the relation between Christ and His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: "Let <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> be subject to their husbands, as to the Lord: because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He is the saviour of his body. Therefore as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be to their husbands in all things. Husbands, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your wives, as Christ also <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and delivered Himself up for it: that He might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life; that He might present it to Himself a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and without blemish. So also ought men to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> their wives as their own bodies. He that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loveth</a> his wife, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loveth</a> himself. For no man ever <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> his own flesh; but nourisheth it and cherisheth it, as also Christ doth the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: because we are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones." After this exhortation the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> alludes to the Divine institution of marriage in the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetical</a> words proclaimed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through Adam: "For this cause shall a man leave his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father and mother</a> and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh." He then concludes with the significant words in which he characterizes <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> marriage: "This is a great <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; but I speak in Christ and in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>."

<p>It would be rash, of course, to infer immediately from the expression, "This is a great <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>", that marriage is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the New Law in the strict sense, for the meaning of the word <em>sacrament</em>, as already remarked, is too indefinite. But considering the expression in its relation to the preceding words, we are led to the conclusion that it is to be taken in the strict sense of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the New Law. The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> spouses for each other should be modelled on the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> between <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, because <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> marriage, as a copy and token of the union of Christ with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is a great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> or <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. It would not be a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a>, <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> symbol of the union of Christ with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which takes concrete <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, unless it efficaciously represented this union, i.e. not merely by signifying the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> life-union of Christ with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but also by causing that union to be realized in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> members; or, in other words, by conferring the supernatural life of grace. The first marriage between <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> in <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Paradise</a> was a symbol of this union; in fact, merely as a symbol, it surpassed <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> marriages, inasmuch as it was an antecedent <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">type</a>, whereas individual <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> marriages are subsequent representations. There would be no reason, therefore, why the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> should refer with such emphasis to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> marriage as <em>so great</em> a sacrament, if the greatness of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> marriage did not lie in the fact, that it is not a mere sign, but an efficacious sign of the life of grace. In fact, it would be entirely out of keeping with the economy of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> if we possessed a sign of grace and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> instituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which was only an empty sign, and not an efficacious one. Elsewhere (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#vrs9">Galatians 4:9</a>), <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> emphasizes in a most significant fashion the difference between the Old and the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, when he calls the religious <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of the former "weak and needy elements" which could not of themselves confer <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, the effect of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> being reserved for the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and its religious <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>. If, therefore, he terms <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> marriage, as a religious <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a>, a great sacrament, he means not to reduce it to the low plane of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, to the plane of a "weak and needy element", but rather to show its importance as a sign of the life of grace, and, like the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, an efficacious sign. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, then, does not speak of marriage as a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in explicit and immediately apparent fashion, but only in such wise that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> must be <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a> from his words. Hence, the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIV), in the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> chapter on marriage, says that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacramental</a> effect of grace in marriage is "intimated" by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05485a.htm">Epistle to the Ephesians</a> (<em>quod Paulus Apostolus innuit</em>). For further confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that marriage under the New Law confers grace and is therefore included among the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> refers to the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Holy Fathers</a>, the earlier councils, and the ever manifest <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> of the universal <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The teaching of the Fathers and the constant <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as already remarked, set forth the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> marriage as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, not in the scientific, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> terminology of later time, but only in <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Substantially, the following elements belong to a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the New Law: <ul> <li>it must be a sacred religious <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> instituted by Christ; <li>this <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> must be a <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign</a> of interior sanctification; <li>it must confer this interior sanctification or <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>; <li>this effect of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> must be produced, not only in conjunction with the respective religious <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a>, but through it. </ul> Hence, whoever attributes these elements to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> marriage, thereby declares it a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in the strict sense of the word.

<p>Testimony to this effect is to be found from the earliest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> times onward. The clearest is that of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> in his works <a href="../fathers/1309.htm">"De bono conjugii"</a> and <a href="../fathers/1507.htm">"De nuptiis et concupiscentia"</a>. In the former work (<a href="../fathers/1309.htm">chapter 24</a>), he says, "Among all people and all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> the good that is secured by marriage consists in the offspring and in the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> of married fidelity; but, in the case of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> people [the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>], it consists moreover in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, by reason of which it is forbidden, even after a separation has taken place, to marry another as long as the first partner lives . . . just as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to draw together a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community, and even though no such community be formed, the Sacrament of Orders still abides in those <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, or just as the Sacrament of the Lord, once it is conferred, abides even in one who is dismissed from his office on account of guilt, although in such a one it abides unto judgment." In the other work (<a href="../fathers/15071.htm">1.10</a>), the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Doctor says: "Undoubtedly it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> that, when man and wife are once united by marriage, this bond remains indissoluble throughout their lives. As long as both live, there remains a something attached to the marriage, which neither mutual separation nor union with a third can remove; in such cases, indeed, it remains for the aggravation of the guilt of their crime, not for the strengthening of the union. Just as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, which was once similarly wedded unto Christ and now separates itself from Him, does not, in spite of its loss of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, lose the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Sacrament of Faith</a>, which it has received in the waters of <a href="../cathen/12714a.htm">regeneration</a>." In these words, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> places marriage, which he names a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, on the same level with <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a>. Thus, as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a> are <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in the strict sense and are recognized as such by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">Holy</a> Doctor, he also considers the marriage of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in the full and strict sense of the word.

<p>Scarcely less clear is the testimony of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>. In his letter to <a href="../cathen/14026a.htm">Siricius</a> (Ep. xlii, 3, in P.L., XVI, 1124), he states: "We also do not deny that marriage was sanctified by Christ"; and to Vigilius he writes (Ep. xix, 7, in P.L., XVI, 984): "Since the contracting of marriage must be sanctified by the veiling and the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, how can there be any mention of a marriage, when unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is wanting?" Of what kind this sanctification is, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> tells us clearly in his work "De Abraham" (I, vii, in P.L., XIV, 443): "We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the Head and Protector, who does not permit that another's marriage-bed be defiled; and further that one guilty of such a crime <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose command he contravenes and whose bond of grace he loosens. Therefore, since he has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he now loses his participation in the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>." According to <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, therefore, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> marriage is a <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, which binds one with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the bonds of grace until these bonds are sundered by subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is, it is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in the strict and complete sense of the word. The value of this testimony might be weakened only by supposing that <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, in referring to the "participation in the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>" which he declares forfeited by <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterers</a>, was really thinking of <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>. But of the latter there is in the present instance not the slightest question; consequently, he must here mean the loss of all share in the grace of the Sacrament of Marriage. This production of grace through marriage, and therefore its character as a perfect <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, was emphasized also by <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a> in his letter to Probus (Ep. ix, in P.L., XX, 602). He declares a second marriage during the lifetime of the first partner invalid, and adds: "Supported by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, we declare that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage is that which is originally founded on <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>."

<p>As early as the second century we have the valuable testimony of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>. While still a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, he writes (<a href="../fathers/0404.htm">"Ad Uxorem"</a>): "If therefore such a marriage is pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherefore should it not turn out happily, so that it will not be troubled by afflictions and needs and obstacles and contaminations, since it enjoys the protection of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>?" But if <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> and its protection are, as <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> asserts, given with marriage, we have therein the distinctive moment which constitutes a religious action (already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> for other reasons as a sign of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>) an efficacious sign of grace, that is, a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacrament</a> of the New Dispensation. It is only on this hypothesis that we can rightly understand another passage from the same work of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (II, ix, in P.L., I, 1302): "How can we describe the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of those marriages which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ratifies, the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacrifice</a> strengthens, the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> seals, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> publish, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Heavenly Father</a> propitiously beholds?"

<p>Weightier, if anything, than the testimony of the Fathers as to the <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">sacramental character</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> marriage is that of the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> and <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">sacramentaries</a> of the different Churches, <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern</a> and <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western</a>, recording the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> handed down from the very earliest times. These, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, differ in many unimportant details, but their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> features must be traced back to <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">Apostolic</a> ordinances. In all these rituals and <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical collections</a>, marriage, contracted before the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> during the celebration of Mass, is accompanied by <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> similar to those used in connection with the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; in fact several of these rituals expressly call marriage a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and, because it is a "sacrament of the living", require <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the reception of the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a> before marriage is contracted (cf. <a href="../cathen/09721a.htm">Mart&egrave;ne</a>, "De antiquis ecclesi&aelig; ritibus", I, ix). But the venerable age, in fact the <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">apostolicity</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">ecclesiastical tradition</a> concerning marriage is still more clearly revealed by the circumstance that the rituals or <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, even of those that separated from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the first centuries, treat the contracting of marriage as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and surround it with significant and impressive <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a>, <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> etc., all agree in this point (cf. <a href="../cathen/01794a.htm">J.S. Assemani</a>, "Bibliotheca orientalis", III, i, 356; ii, 319 sqq.; <a href="../cathen/13526c.htm">Schelstrate</a>, "Acta oriental. eccl.", I, 150 sqq.; <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Ritus orientalium", I, 150 sqq.; II, 364 sqq.). The numerous <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which are used throughout the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> refer to a special grace which is to be granted to the newly-married <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and occasional <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commentaries</a> show that this grace was regarded as <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacramental</a>. Thus, the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> patriarch, Timotheus II, in his work "De septem causis sacramentorum" mentioned in <a href="../cathen/01794a.htm">Assemani</a> (III, i, 579), deals with marriage among the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and enumerates several religious <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> without which marriage is invalid. Evidently, therefore, he includes marriage among the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and considers the grace resulting from it a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacramental</a> grace.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that marriage is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the New Law has never been a matter of dispute between the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> and any of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a> separated from it &#151; a convincing <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> has always been part of <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">ecclesiastical tradition</a> and is derived from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. The correspondence (1576-81) between the <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a> professors, defenders of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, and the Greek patriarch, <a href="../cathen/08333c.htm">Jeremias</a>, is well known. It terminated in the latter's indignantly scouting the suggestion that he could be won over to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of only two <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and in his <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> recognition of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of seven <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, including marriage, as the constant teaching of the Oriental Church. More than half a century later the Patriarch Cyril Lucar, who had adopted the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of only two <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, was for that reason publicly declared a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">Synods</a> of Constantinople in 1638 and 1642 and that of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in 1672 &#151; so firmly has the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of seven <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and of marriage as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> been maintained by the Greek and by Oriental <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> in general.

<p><a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">Doubts</a> as to the thoroughly <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">sacramental character</a> of marriage arose in a very few isolated cases, when the attempt was made to formulate, according to speculative science, the definition of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and to determine exactly their effects. Only one prominent <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> can be named who denied that marriage confers <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, and consequently that it is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the New Law in the strict sense of the word &#151; Durandus of St. Pour&ccedil;ain, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Meaux. Even he admitted that marriage in some way produces grace, and therefore that it should be called a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; but it was only the actual help of grace in subduing passion, which he <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a> from marriage as an effect, not <em>ex opere operato</em>, but <em>ex opere operantis</em> (cf. <a href="../cathen/11702b.htm">Perrone</a>, "De matrimonio christiano", I, i, 1, 2). As authorities he could cite only a few jurists. <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> with the greatest unanimity rejected this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> as new and opposed to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so that the celebrated <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, <a href="../cathen/14152a.htm">Dominicus Soto</a>, said of <a href="../cathen/05208a.htm">Durandus</a>, that it was only with difficulty he had escaped the danger of being branded as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. Many of the leading <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastics</a> spoke indeed of marriage as a remedy against sensuality &#151; e.g. <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> (whose fourth book of sentences was commentated by <a href="../cathen/05208a.htm">Durandus</a>), and his most distinguished <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commentators</a> <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, <a href="../cathen/11434c.htm">Petrus de Palude</a>. But the conferring of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> <em>ex opere operato</em> is not thereby excluded; on the contrary, it must be regarded as the foundation of that <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a>, and as the root from which springs the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to receive the Divine assistance as occasion requires. That this is the teaching of those great <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> is evident partly from their explicit declarations concerning the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of marriage, and partly from what they defined as the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> element of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacraments</a> of the New Law in general. It is sufficient here to give the references: <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, "In IV Sent.", dist. II, i, 4; II, ii, 1; XXVI, ii, 3; <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, "In IV Sent.", dist. II, iii; XXVI, ii.

<p>The real reason why some jurists hesitated to call marriage a grace-giving <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> was a religious one. It was <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> and its grace could not be purchased. Yet such a transaction took place in marriage, as a dowry was ordinarily paid to the man. But this objection is baseless. For, although Christ has raised marriage or the marriage <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> to the dignity of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> (as will be shown below), yet marriage, even among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, has not thereby lost its natural significance. The dowry, the use of which devolves on the man, is given as a contribution towards bearing the natural burdens of marriage, i.e., the support of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the offspring, not as the price of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p>For a better understanding of the <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">sacramental character</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> as opposed to non-Christian marriage, we may briefly state the relations of the one to the other, especially as it cannot be denied that every marriage from the beginning has had, and has, the character of something <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and religious, and may therefore be designated as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in the broader sense of the word. In this connection we cannot pass over the instructive <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">encyclical</a> of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> mentioned above. He says: "Marriage has <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for its Author, and was from the very beginning a kind of foreshadowing of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> of the Divine Word; consequently, there abides in it a something <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and religious; not extraneous but innate; not derived from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but implanted by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. It was not, therefore, without good reason that our predecessors, <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> and <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>, affirmed that a certain <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of marriage' existed ever among the believers and unbelievers. We call to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> the monuments of antiquity, as also the manners and customs of those peoples who, being the most civilized, had a finer sense of equity and right. In the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of all of them it was a deeply rooted conviction that marriage was to be regarded as something sacred. Hence, among these, marriages were commonly celebrated with religious <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>, under the authority of pontiffs, and with the ministry of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>&mdash;so great, even in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, was the impression produced by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of marriage, by reflection on the history of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, and by the <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">consciousness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>."

<p>The term "sacrament", applied by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to all marriage, even those of <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidels</a>, is to be taken in its widest sense, and signifies nothing but a certain <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> inherent in marriage. Even among the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> marriage never had the importance of an <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in the strict sense, since even such a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> produced a certain <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> (not indeed the interior <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> which is effected by the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, but only an external <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">legal purity</a>), and even this was not connected with the marriage <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of marriage in general is of another kind. The original marriage, and consequently marriage as it was conceived in the original plan of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, was to be the means not merely of the natural propagation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, but also the means by which personal <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> should be transmitted to the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> descendents of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parents</a>. It was, therefore, a great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, intended not for the personal sanctification of those united by the marriage tie, but for the sanctification of others, i.e. of their offspring. But this Divinely ordered <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of marriage was destroyed by <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. The effectual sanctification of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, or rather of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> men, had now to be accomplished in the way of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> through the Promised Redeemer, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God made Man</a>. In place of its former <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, marriage retained only the significance of a <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">type</a> feebly representing the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> that was thenceforth to be acquired; it foreshadowed the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and the close union which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was thereby to form with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. It was reserved for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> marriage to symbolize this higher <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> union with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, that is, with those who unite themselves to Christ in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and to be an efficacious sign of this union.
<h2 id="section2">Minister of the sacrament; matter and form</h2>

<p>Although the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> realized from the first the complete sacramentality of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> marriage, yet for a time there was some uncertainty as to what in the marriage <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> is the real <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; as to its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, and its <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a>. From the earliest times this fundamental proposition has been upheld: <em>Matrimonium facit consensus</em>, i.e. Marriage is contracted through the mutual, expressed <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a>. Therein is contained implicitly the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> contracting marriage are themselves the agents or <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. However, it has been likewise emphasized that marriage must be contracted with the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, for otherwise it would be a source not of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">malediction</a>. Hence it might easily be inferred that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> is the grace-giving element, or <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a>. But this is a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> conclusion. The first <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> to designate clearly and distinctly the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> as the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacrament</a> and his <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> as the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacramental</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> was apparently <a href="../cathen/03251a.htm">Melchior Canus</a> (d. 1560). In his well-known work, "De locis theologicis", VIII, v, he sets forth the following propositions: <ul> <li>It is, indeed, a common opinion of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, but not their <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> and settled <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, that a marriage contracted without a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and real <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; <li>the controversies on this point do not affect matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and religion; <li>it would be <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> to state that all <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> defended that opinion. </ul> In the course of the same chapter Canus defends, as a vital matter, the opinion that without the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and his <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> a valid marriage may take place, but a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacramental</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> and valid <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> are lacking. For this opinion he appeals to <a href="../cathen/11434c.htm">Petrus de Palude</a> (In IV Sent., dist. V, ii) and also to <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> ("In IV Sent.", dist. I, i, 3: "Summa contra gentiles", IV, lxxviii), as well as to a number of Fathers and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of the earliest centuries, who compared a marriage contracted without <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> to an <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> marriage, and therefore could not have recognized a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> therein.

<p>The appeal, however, to the above authorities is unfortunate. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, in the first article cited by Canus, entitled "Utrum consistant sacramenta in verbis et rebus", raises the following difficulty: "<a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Penance</a> and marriage belong to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>: but for their validity, words are unnecessary; therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that words belong to all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>." This difficulty he answers at the end of the article: "Marriage taken as a natural function and penance as an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> have no <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> of words: but in so far as both belong to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, which are to be conferred by the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, words are employed in both; in marriage the words which express mutual <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a>, and also the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> which were instituted by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and in penance the words of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> spoken by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>." Although <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> mentions the words of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> along with the words of mutual <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a>, he expressly calls them an institution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and hence they do not constitute the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Again, though he seems to understand that marriage, also, must be administered by the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it cannot be denied that the contracting parties in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> marriage must be guided by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> regulations, and cannot act otherwise than as <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> subject to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or dispensers of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. If, however, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> in this passage attributes to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> too great an influence on the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of marriage, he manifestly corrects himself in his later work, "Summa contra gentiles", in which he undoubtedly places the whole <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in the mutual <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> of the contracting parties: "Marriage, therefore, inasmuch as it consists in the union of man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who propose to beget and rear children for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; therefore the contracting parties are <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And as in the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> something spiritual is signified by an external <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, so here in this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the union of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is typified by the union of man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a>: 'This is a great <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but I speak in Christ and in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.' And as the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> effect what they signify, it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> contracting marriage receive through this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the grace by which they participate in the union of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." Hence the whole <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and grace-producing power of marriage consists, according to <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, in the union of man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> (in presence of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>), not in the additional <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>The same seems to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the passage from <a href="../cathen/11434c.htm">Petrus de Palude</a> cited by Canus. As his work, "Commentarium in IV Librum Sententiarum" is not so readily accessible, we may state precisely the edition used here: It bears as a final note the comment: Explicit scriptum in quartum sententarium Clarissimi et Acutissimi doctoris <a href="../cathen/11434c.htm">Petri de Palude</a> patriarch Hierosolymitani, ordinis fratrum pr&aelig;dicatorum perquam diligentissime Impressum Venetiis per Bonettum Locatellum Bergomensem mandato Nobilis viri Octaviani Scoti Civis Modoetiensis Anno a natali partu Intemerate Virginis nonagesimotertio cum Quadringentesimo supra millesimum XII Kalendas Octobris." Here it says expressly in dist. V., Q. xi (fol. 124, col. 1): "It seems that one who <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contracts</a> marriage in the state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> although the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of marriage consists in the mutual <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a>, which the parties mutually express; this <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> confers the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> and not the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by his <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>; he only confers a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacramental</a>." Further on, in dist. XXVI, Q. iv (fol. 141, col. 4), he says: "Marriage is such that its efficacy is not based on the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>). Its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, therefore, can exist without the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, not because it is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> &#151; though it is indeed <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, just as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> &#151; but because its efficacy does not come from the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Perhaps, however, it is not lawful to <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> marriage except in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and before the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, if this is possible." These passages are clear. It is hard to see why <a href="../cathen/03251a.htm">Melchior Canus</a> tried to support his opinion by the opening words of the first quotation. He supposes that from the words "it seems that one who <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contracts</a> marriage in the state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" the conclusion is to be drawn that de <a href="../cathen/11434c.htm">Palude</a> means in this case a marriage which is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; for to administer or receive a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in a state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a grave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>. But on the other hand, it is to be noted that <a href="../cathen/11434c.htm">de Palude</a> in unmistakable terms declares the mutual <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> to be the conferring of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. The words, "it seems", merely introduce a difficulty: whether this expresses his own view, he does not make clear, in so far as the contracting of marriage means the reception of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; in so far as it is the administration of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> he regards it as probable that the administering of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is an additional <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> only in the case of <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> for the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, but the contracting parties in marriage are not such <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>.

<p>The opinion of Canus finds but little support in the expressions of the Fathers or in <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">papal letters</a>, which state that marriage without the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is declared unholy, wicked, or <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a>, that it does not bring the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace of God</a> but provokes His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>. This is nothing more than what the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> says in the chapter <a href="../cathen/14441b.htm">"Tametsi"</a> (XXIV, i, de ref. Matr.), namely, that "the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Holy Church of God</a> has always detested and forbidden <a href="../cathen/04001a.htm">clandestine marriages</a>". Such statements do not deny the <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">sacramental character</a> of marriage so contracted; but they do condemn as <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> that reception of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> which indeed lays open the source of grace, yet places an obstacle in the way of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament's</a> efficacy.

<p>For a long time, nevertheless, the opinion of Canus had its defenders among the post-Tridentine <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. Even Prosper Lambertini, as <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, did not set aside his pronouncement, given in his work "De synodo dioecesana", VIII, xiii, that Canus's view was "valde probabilis", although in his capacity as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> he taught the opposite clearly and distinctly in his letter to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>. Today it must be rejected by all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and branded at least as <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. The inferences not contemplated by the originators of this opinion, but <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a> later and used in practice against the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, constrained succeeding <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> repeatedly to condemn it formally. Subservient <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and court <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> especially found it useful as warranting the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> in making <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> concerning validity and invalidity, diriment <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a>, and the like. For, if the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> consisted in the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a>, as was never <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>, in the mutual <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> of the parties, evidently then <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> and <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> must be separated; the former had to precede as a foundation; upon it, as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, was founded the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, which took place through the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. But <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contracts</a>, which affect social and civil life, are subject to state authority, so that this can make such regulations and restrictions even as to their validity, as it deems <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the public weal. This practical conclusion was drawn especially by Marcus Antonius de Dominis, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, afterwards an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, in his work "De republica ecclesiastica" (V, xi, 22), and by Launoy in his work "Regia in matrimonio potestas" (I, ix sqq.). In the middle of the last century Nepomuk Nuytz, professor at the <a href="../cathen/15094a.htm">University of Turin</a>, defended this opinion with renewed vigour in order to supply a juridicial basis for civil legislation regarding marriage. Nuytz's work was thereupon expressly condemned by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in the Apostolical Letter of 22 Aug., 1851, in which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> declared as <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> especially the following propositions: The <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of marriage is only something which is added to the <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> of marriage and which can be separated from it; the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> consists only in the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of the marriage. These propositions are included in the "Syllabus" of 8 December 1864, and must be rejected by all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In like manner <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> expresses himself in the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Arcanum" quoted above. He says: "It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> marriage the <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> is inseparable from the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; and that, for this reason, the <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and legitimate without being a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> as well. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ our Lord</a> added to marriage the dignity of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; but marriage is the <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> itself, whenever that <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> is lawfully made. . . . Hence it is clear that among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> every <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage is, in itself and by itself, a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; and that nothing can be farther from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> than to say that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is a certain added ornament, or external adjunct, which can be separated and torn away from the <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> at the caprice of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p>As it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, therefore, from the point of view of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that marriage as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is fulfilled only through the mutual <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> of the contracting parties, it is a matter of secondary consideration, how and in what sense the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> are to be taken. The view that most correctly explains this is perhaps the one that is generally prevalent today; in every <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> two elements are to be distinguished, the offering of a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> and the acceptance of it; the former is the foundation, the latter is the juridicial completion. The same holds <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacramental</a> <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> of marriage; in so far, therefore as an offering of the marriage <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> is contained in the mutual declaration of <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a>, we have the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and, in so far as a mutual acceptance is contained therein, we have the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p>To complete our inquiry concerning the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the Sacrament of Marriage, its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, and its <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a>, we have still to mention a theory that was defended by a few jurists of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> and has been revived by Dr. Jos. Freisen ("Geschichte des canonischen Eherechts", T&uuml;bingen, 1888). According to this marriage in the strict sense, and therefore marriage as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, is not accomplished until consummation of the marriage is added to the <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a>. It is the consummation, therefore, that constitutes the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. But as Freisen retracted this opinion which could not be harmonized with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> definitions, it is no longer of actual interest. This view was derived from the fact that marriage, according to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> command, is absolutely indissoluble. On the other hand, it is undeniably the teaching and practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that, in spite of mutual <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a>, marriage can be dissolved by <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> or by the declaration of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; hence the conclusion seemed to be that there was no real marriage previous to the consummation, since admittedly neither <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> nor <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> declaration can afterwards effect a dissolution. The <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> lies in taking indissolubility in a sense that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has never held. In one case, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, according to earlier ecclesiastical law, the previous relation of mere <a href="../cathen/05542d.htm">espousal</a> between man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> became a lawful marriage (and therefore the Sacrament of Marriage), namely when a valid <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a> was followed by consummation. It was a legal presumption that in this case the <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> parties wished to lessen the sinfulness of their action as much as possible, and therefore performed it with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of marriage and not of fornication. The efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the marriage <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a>, as well as of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, was even in this case the mutual <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of marriage, although expression was not given to it in the regular way. This legal presumption ceased on 5 Feb., 1892, by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, as it had grown obsolete among the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> and was no longer adapted to actual <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>.
<h2 id="section3">Difference between the sacrament of marriage and the other sacraments</h2>

<p>From all that has been said, it is clear that while marriage, inasmuch as it is an outward sign of grace and also produces interior grace, has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> common to all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, still, viewed as an external sign, it is unique and very different from the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. The external sign is a <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a>; hence marriage, even as an effective sign or <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, has precisely the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a>, its validity depending on the rules for the validity of <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contracts</a>. And, as we can distinguish between a <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> in its origin and a <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> in its continuance, so we can distinguish between the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of marriage <em>in fieri</em> and <em>in facto esse</em>. The <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> <em>in fieri</em> is the above-mentioned mutual declaration of <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a>; the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> <em>in facto esse</em> is the Divine bond which unites the married <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> for life. In most of the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> also there is this distinction between <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> <em>in fieri</em> and <em>in facto esse</em>; but the continuance of the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is based mostly on the inamissible <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> which they impress upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the recipient. Not so with marriage; in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the recipient there is a question of no new physical being or mode of being, but of a legal <a href="../cathen/12731b.htm">relationship</a> which can as a rule be broken only by death, although in <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> cases it may otherwise be rendered void, provided the marriage has not been consummated. In this respect, therefore, marriage, especially as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, differs from other <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contracts</a>, since it is not subject to the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. Of course, the choice of a partner and especially the contracting or non-contracting of marriage are subject to the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>; but any <a href="../cathen/13007a.htm">revocation</a> or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> altering of the terms is beyond the power of the contracting parties; the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the contractual <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is Divinely regulated.

<p>Of still greater importance is the <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> aspect of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> <em>in fieri</em>. In the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, the conditional administration is admissible only within narrow limits. There can only be questions of <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of the present or past, which, according as they are verified or not verified in fact, there and then admit or prevent the valid administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But generally even these <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> have no influence on the validity; they are made for the sake of greater reverence, so as to avoid even the appearance of regarding the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacramental</a> procedure as useless. The Sacrament of Marriage, on the contrary, follows the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> in all these matters. It admits <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> not only of the past and present, but also future <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> which delay the production of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> until the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> are fulfilled. At the moment, these are fulfilled the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> and its conferring of grace take place in virtue of the mutual <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> previously expressed and still continuing. Only diriment <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> are opposed to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the Sacrament of Marriage, because it consists in an indissoluble <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a>. Any such <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>, as well as all others that are opposed to the intrinsic <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of marriage, have as a result the invalidity of both the <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p>A further <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the Sacrament of Marriage, not possessed by the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, is that it can be effected without the personal presence of the mutual <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> and recipients. A consensual agreement can be made in writing as well as orally, and by proxy as well as in person. Hence these methods are not opposed to the validity of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Of course, according to ecclesiastical law, the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> prescribed for validity is, as a rule, the personal, mutual declaration of <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> before <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>; but that is a requirement added to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of marriage and to <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can therefore set aside and from which she can dispense in individual cases. Even the contracting of marriage through authorized representatives is not absolutely excluded. In such a case, however, this representative could not be called the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a>, much less the recipient of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but merely the agent or intermediary. The declaration of <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> made by him is valid only in so far as it represents and contains the <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> of his principal; it is the latter which effects the <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> and <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, hence the principal is the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. It is the principal, and not the agent, who receives the <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> of and marries the other party, and who therefore also receives the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. It does not matter whether the principal, at the exact moment when the <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> is expressed by his agent, has the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">consciousness</a>, or is deprived of it (e.g. by sleep); as soon as the mutual <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> is given, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> comes into being with the <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a>, and the conferring of grace takes place at the same time, provided no obstacle is placed in the way of this effect. The actual use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is no more required for it than in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of an infant or in <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">extreme unction</a> administered to an unconscious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. It may even happen in the case of marriage that the <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a>, which was given many years ago, only now takes effect. This occurs in the case of the so-called <em>sanatio in radice</em>. Through this an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediment</a>, hitherto invalidating the marriage, is removed by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, and the mutual <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> previously given without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediment</a> is accepted as legitimate, provided it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that this <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> has habitually continued according to its original intent. At the moment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> the original <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> becomes the effective <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> and the hitherto presumptive, but now real, spouses receive the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacramental</a> effect in the increase of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, provided they place no obstacle in the way.
<h2 id="section4">The extent of sacramental marriage</h2>

<p>As we have several times emphasized, not every marriage is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but only marriages between <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. One becomes and remains a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> in the sense recognized here through valid <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Hence only one who has been validly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> can <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> a marriage which is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; but every one can <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> it who has been validly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, whether he has remained true to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a>, or become a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, or even an <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidel</a>. Such has always been the teaching and practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> one "becomes a member of Christ and is incorporated in the body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>", as declared in the Florentine <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> for the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>; so far as <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is concerned, he remains irrevocably subject to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and is therefore, in legal questions, always to be considered a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. Hence it is a general principle that all <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are subject to universal ecclesiastical laws, especially marriage <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> unless the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> makes an exception for <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> cases or classes. Hence not only the marriage between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but also that contracted by members of the different <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> which have retained <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and validly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, is undoubtedly a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. It matters not whether the non-Catholic considers marriage a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> or not, or whether he <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intends</a> to effect a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> or not. Provided only he <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intends</a> to <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage, and expresses the requisite <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a>, this <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> and this expression are sufficient to constitute a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But if he is absolutely determined not to effect a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, then, of course, the production of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> would be excluded, but the marriage <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> also would be null and void. By Divine ordinance it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> marriage that it should be a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; it is not in the power of the contracting parties to eliminate anything from its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who has the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of doing this invalidates the whole <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, therefore, that marriage contracted between <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, even the so-called <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriage</a> between a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and a non-Catholic, provided the non-Catholic has been validly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. It is equally <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that marriage between unbaptized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in the strict sense of the word.

<p>There is, however, great uncertainty as to how those marriages are to be regarded which exist legitimately and validly between a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and an unbaptized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Such marriages may occur in two ways. In the first place, a marriage may have been contracted between unbelievers, one of whom afterwards becomes a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, while the other remains an unbeliever. (Here believer and unbeliever are taken in the sense of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and unbaptized.) The marriage contracted validly while both were unbelievers continues to <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">exist</a>, and though under certain circumstances it is dissoluble, it is not rendered void simply because of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of one of the parties, for, as <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> says (in IV, xix, 8), "through the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of baptism</a> marriage is not dissolved, but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven", and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> expressly states (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#vrs12">1 Corinthians 7:12 sq.</a>): "If any brother hath a wife that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> not, and she <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> to dwell with him, let him not put her away. And if any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> hath a husband that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> not, and he <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> to dwell with her, let her not put away her husband." There is question here, therefore, of a marriage which subsequently has developed into a marriage between <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and unbaptized. Secondly, there may be question of a marriage, which from the beginning was a <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriage</a>, i.e. which was contracted between a believer and an unbeliever. By ecclesiastical law, such a marriage cannot take place without a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which has made <a href="../cathen/05037b.htm">disparity of worship</a> between <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and unbaptized a diriment <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediment</a>. In regard to both kinds of <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriage</a> it may be asked whether they have the character of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and whether they have the effect of imparting grace at least to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> party. As to the unbaptized party, there can clearly be no question of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> or sacramental grace, for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is the door to the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, none of which can be validly received before it.

<p>The opinions of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> on this point vary considerably. Some maintain that in both kinds of <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> party receives the grace of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; others deny this in the case of a marriage <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> contracted by unbelievers which subsequently becomes a <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriage</a>, and affirm it in the case of a marriage contracted by a believer with an unbeliever in virtue of a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; a third class again deny that there is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> or sacramental grace in either case. The first view was held as probable by Palmieri (De matrimonio christiano, cap. ii, thes. ii, Append. 8. 3), Rosset (De sacramento matrimonii, I, 350), and others; the second by the older authors, <a href="../cathen/14152a.htm">Soto</a>, <a href="../cathen/14800a.htm">Tourn&eacute;ly</a>, Collet, and, among recent authors, especially by <a href="../cathen/11702b.htm">Perrone</a> (De matrimonio christiano, I, 306-311); Sasse and Christian Pesch declare at least in favour of the <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">sacramental character</a> of a marriage contracted with <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> between a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and an unbaptized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but express no opinion on the other case. The third opinion is upheld by <a href="../cathen/15275a.htm">Vasquez</a> and <a href="../cathen/13427c.htm">Thomas Sanchez</a>, and is at the present <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> vigorously defended by Billot (De sacramentis: II, De matrimonio, thesis xxxviii, sec. 3) and Wernz (Jus Decretalium, IV, v, 44).

<p>No side brings convincing <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. Perhaps the weakest grounds are adduced for the opinion which, in regard to marriage contracted by unbelievers, claims sacramentality and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacramental</a> grace after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> for the party who, subsequently to the marriage, is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. These grounds are mostly negative; for example, there is no reason why an unbaptized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> should not administer a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, as is clearly done in the case of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; or why the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacramental</a> effect should not take place in one party which cannot take place in the other, as in the case of a marriage between <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> where one party is in the state of grace and the other is not, so that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of marriage confers grace on the former, but not on the latter. Besides, it is not fitting that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> should be altogether deprived of grace. As against this view, there seems to be a weighty reason in the fact that such a marriage contracted in infidelity is still dissoluble, even after years of continuation, either through the Pauline Privilege or through the plenary authority of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. And yet it has always been a principle with <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> that a <em>matrimonium ratum et consummatum</em> (i.e. a marriage that bears the <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">sacramental character</a> and is afterwards consummated) is by <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine Law</a> absolutely indissoluble, so that not even the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> can on any grounds whatsoever dissolve it. Hence, it seems to follow that the marriage in question is not a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p>This argument reversed, together with the reason of fitness mentioned above, tells in favour of the sacramentality of a marriage contracted with <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> between a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and an unbaptized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Such a marriage, once it is consummated, is absolutely indissoluble, just as a consummated marriage between two <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; under no circumstances may recourse be had to the Pauline Privilege, nor will any other dissolution be granted by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (for documents see Lehmkuhl, "Theol. Mor.", II, 928). A further reason is that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> claims <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over such <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, institutes diriment <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> to them, and grants <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a>. This authority regarding marriages <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> bases on their sacramentality; hence it seems that the marriage in question should be included among marriages that are <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. The words of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> in his letter to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mutila are as follows: "If, therefore, these matters (he is speaking of marriage) belong exclusively to the <a href="../cathen/06153b.htm">ecclesiastical forum</a> for no other reason than that the marriage <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> is truly and properly one of the seven <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the Law of the Gospel, then, since this <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">sacramental character</a> is inherent in all marriage-matters, they must all be subject to the exclusive <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>."

<p>However, these arguments likewise fail to carry conviction. In the first place, many deny that the <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> in question pertain exclusively to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but claim a certain <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> for the State as well; only in case of conflict the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has the preference; the exclusive <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is confined to marriages between two <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> also possesses some authority, no doubt, over all marriages contracted in infidelity, as soon as one party receives <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but this does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the sacramentality, after the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of one party, of a marriage contracted by <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidels</a>. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether matters affecting the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> marriage are subject to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority for the sole reason that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> marriage was raised to the dignity of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, or for the more general reason that it is a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and religious thing. In the document cited above <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> gives no decision on the point. In case the latter reason is of itself sufficient, then the conclusion is all the more secure if, as <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> says, "the raising to the dignity of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>" is taken as a reason. In fact the elevation of marriage to a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> can well serve as a ground for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, even in regard to a marriage which is only an inchoate <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p>As positive <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> against the sacramentality of the <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> with which we are dealing, the advocates of the third opinion emphasize the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of marriage as a <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a>. Marriage is an indivisible <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> which cannot be one thing for one party and another thing for the other party. If it cannot be a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> for one, then it cannot be a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> for the other. The <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> <em>in facto esse</em> is not really an entity that exists in the parties, but rather a relation between them, and indeed a relation of the same sort on both sides. Now, this cannot be a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> <em>in facto esse</em>, if in one of the parties the basis of the relation has no <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">sacramental character</a>. But, if the <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> <em>in facto esse</em> be no <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, then the actual contracting of marriage cannot be a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> <em>in fieri</em>. Were the opposite opinion correct, the <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> would be rather lame, i.e. firmer in the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> party than in the unbaptized, since the greater constancy of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> marriage arises precisely from its character as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But such an uneven <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> seems opposed to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of marriage. Should it be urged on the contrary that as a result in extraordinary cases these <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> might be dissolved just as in the case of those contracted by two unbaptized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, this inference is to be rejected. Apart from the question whether the inner constancy does not of itself exclude such a dissolution, it is quite <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that, externally, the most complete indissolubility is secured for such <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, or, in other words, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which by its approval has made them possible, also makes them by its <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> indissoluble. A dissolution in virtue of the Pauline Privilege is thus not certainly available, since it might be utilized <em>in odium fidei</em>, instead of <em>in favorem fidei</em>. In any case, as to the application of this <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the authoritative interpreter and judge. These arguments, though not perhaps decisive, may serve to recommend the third opinion as the most probable and best founded.

<p>There still remains the one question, on which also <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> are still to some extent divided, as to whether and at what moment marriages legitimately contracted between the unbaptized become a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> on the subsequent <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the two parties. That they never become a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> was taught in his day by <a href="../cathen/15275a.htm">Vasquez</a>, and also by the canonists Weistner and <a href="../cathen/01326b.htm">Schmalzgr&uuml;ber</a>. This view may today be regarded as abandoned, and cannot be reconciled with the official decisions since given by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The discussion must, therefore, be confined to the question, whether through the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> alone (i.e. at the moment when the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the later <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> of the two partners is completed) the marriage becomes a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, or whether for this purpose the renewal of their mutual <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, <a href="../cathen/09095a.htm">Laymann</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> defended the latter view; the former, which was already maintained by <a href="../cathen/13427c.htm">Sanchez</a>, is today generally accepted, and is followed by Sape, Rosset, Billot, <a href="../cathen/11739b.htm">Pesch</a>, Wernz etc. This opinion is based on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> teaching which declares that among the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> there can be no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage which is not also a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Now, immediately after the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of both partners, the already contracted marriage, which is not dissolved by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, becomes a "marriage of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>"; for were it not immediately a "sacrament", the above-mentioned general principle, which <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> and <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> proclaimed as incontestable <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, would be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>. Consequently we must say that, through the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> itself, the existing marriage passes into a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. A difficulty may arise only in the determination as to where in such a case the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> are to be sought, and what <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> completes the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. This problem, it would seem, is most readily solved by falling back on the virtually continuing mutual <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> of the parties, which has been already formally given. This virtual wish to be and to remain partners in marriage, which is not annulled by the reception of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, is an entity in the parties in which may be found the ministration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.
