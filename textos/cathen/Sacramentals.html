<h1>Sacramentals</h1>  

<p>In instituting the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> Christ did not determine the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and form down to the slightest detail, leaving this task to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which should determine what rites were suitable in the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. These rites are indicated by the word <em>Sacramentalia</em>, the object of which is to manifest the respect due to the sacrament and to secure the sanctification of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. They belong to widely different categories, e.g.: substance, in the mingling of water with Eucharistic wine; quantity, in the triple <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> effusion; quality, in the condition of unleavened bread; relation, in the capacity of the minister; time and place, in feast-days and churches; habit, in the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments; posture, in genuflection, prostrations; action, in chanting etc. So many external conditions connect the sacramentals with the virtue of religion, their object being indicated by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXII, 15), that it is asserted that apart from their ancient origin and traditional maintenance ceremonies, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>, lights, <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, etc. enhance the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> and arouse the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Moreover the sacramentals help to distinguish the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who have done away with the sacramentals or use them arbitrarily with little intelligence.

<p>Sacramental rites are dependent on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which established them, and which therefore has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to maintain, develop, modify, or abrogate them. The ceremonial regulation of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in Apostolic times is sufficiently <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the words of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> to the Corinthians with regard to the Eucharist: "Cetera autem, cum venero, disponam" [the rest I will set in order when I come (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#vrs34">1 Corinthians 11:34</a>)], which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, on what ground we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, supposes to refer to the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of the Eucharistic fast (Ep. liv, "Ad Januarium", c. 6, n. 8, in P.L., XXXIII, 203). The <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> enumerate ceremonies and rites, some of which were instituted by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, others by the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin Martyr</a>, "Apol. I", n. 61, 65 in P.G., VI, 419, 427; <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, "De baptismo", vii in P.L., I, 1206; <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, <a href="../fathers/3203.htm"><em>On the Holy Spirit</em> 67</a>). The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is the heiress of the Apostles, has always used and maintained against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> this power over sacramentals. To her and to her alone belongs the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to determine the matter, form, and minister of the sacramentals. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that is, the supreme authority represented by its visible head, alone legislates in this matter, because the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> no longer have in practice the power to modify of abolish by a particular legislation what is imposed on the universal Church. What concerns the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is contained in detail in the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a> and the Episcopal Ceremoniale.

<p>Apart from the ceremonies relating to the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has instituted others for the purpose of private devotion. To distinguish between them, the latter are named sacramentals because of the resemblance between their rites and those of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> properly so-called. In ancient times the term sacrament alone was used, but numerous confusions resulted and the similarity of rites and terms led many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to regard both as <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. After <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> the use and definition of the word "sacramental" had a fixed character and was exclusively applicable to those rites presenting an external resemblance to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> but not applicable to the sensible signs of Divine institution. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> makes use of the terms <em>sacra</em> and <em>sacramentalia</em> (Summa I-II, Q. cviii, a. 2 ad 2um; III, Q. lxv, a. 1 ad 8um), which the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of a later period adopted, so that at present <em>sacramentalia</em> is exclusively reserved for those rites which are practiced apart from the administration of the seven <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, for which the word ceremonies is used.

<p>The number of the sacramentals may not be limited; nevertheless, the attempt has been made to determine their general principles or rather applications in the verse: "Orans, tinctus, edens, confessus, dans, benedicens". <ul><li><em>Orans</em> indicates public <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> or private;<li><em>tinctus</em>, the use of <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a> and the unctions in use at various <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrations</a>;<li><em>edens</em>, the eating of blessed foods;<li><em>confessus</em>, the general avowal of faults which is made in the <a href="../cathen/04222a.htm">Confiteor</a> recited at Mass, at Communion, in the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>; <li><em>dans</em>, <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>;<li><em>benedicens</em>, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> and episcopal <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> etc., <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> of candles, ashes, palms etc.</ul>Another distinction classifies sacramentals according to whether they are acts, e.g. the <a href="../cathen/04222a.htm">Confiteor</a> mentioned above, or things, such as <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medals</a>, <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a> etc. The sacramentals do not produce <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> <em>ex opere operato</em>, by virtue of the rite or substance employed, and this constitutes their essential difference from the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is unable to increase or reduce the number of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> as they were instituted by Christ, but the sacramentals do not possess this dignity and privilege. <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> do not agree as to whether the sacramentals may confer any other grace <em>ex opere operantis</em> through the action of the one who uses them, but the negative opinion is more generally followed, for as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot confer <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> nor institute signs thereof, neither can she institute efficacious signs of the other <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can give. Moreover, as experience teaches, the sacramentals do not infallibly produce their effect. Finally in the euchologic formulas of the sacramentals the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> makes use, not of affirmative, but of deprecatory expressions, which shows that she looks directly to Divine mercy for the effect.

<p>Besides the efficacy which the sacramentals possess in common with other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> they have a special efficacy of their own. If their whole value proceeded from the <em>opus operantis</em>, all external <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> could be called sacramentals. The special virtue recognized by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and experienced by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the sacramentals should consist in the official <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> whereby we implore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to pour forth special <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> on those who make use of the sacramentals. These <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> move <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to give <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> which He would not otherwise give, and when not infallibly acceded to it is for reasons known to His Wisdom. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is aware of the measure in which He should bestow His gifts. All the sacramentals have not the same effect; this depends on the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which does not make use of the same urgency nor have recourse to the same Divine sources of merit. Some sacramentals derive no special efficacy from the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; such are those which are employed in worship, without a blessing, or even with a blessing which does not specify any particular fruit. This is the case with the blessing of vessels meant to contain the <a href="../cathen/07421b.htm">holy oils</a>: "Give ear to our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, most merciful Father, and deign to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> and sanctify these purified vessels prepared for the use of the sacred ministry of Thy Church". On the other hand, some sacramentals, among them one of those most frequently used, <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>, are the object of a benediction which details their particular effects.

<p>One of the most remarkable effects of sacramentals is the virtue to drive away <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> whose mysterious and baleful operations affect sometimes the physical activity of man. To combat this occult power the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has recourse to <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcism</a> and sacramentals. Another effect is the delivery of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the penalties therefor. Thus in the blessing of a cross the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> asks that this sacred sign may receive the heavenly blessing in order that all those who kneel before it and implore the Divine Majesty may be granted great compunction and a general pardon of faults committed. This means remission of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> alone, with perfect contrition, possess the efficacy to remit mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and to release from the penalties attached to them. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> is explicit on this point: "The episcopal blessing, the aspersion of <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>, every sacramental unction, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in a dedicated church, and the like, effect the remission of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, implicitly or explicitly" (Summa III, Q. lxxxvii, a. 3, ad 1um). Finally the sacramentals may be employed to obtain temporal favours, since the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesses</a> objects made use of in every-day life, e.g. the blessing of a house on which is called down the abundance of heavenly dew and the rich fruitfulness of the earth; so likewise in the benediction of the fields, in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is asked to pour down His <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> on the harvests, so that the wants of the needy may be supplied by the fertile earth.
