<h1>Sacraments</h1>  

<p>Sacraments are outward signs of inward <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> for our sanctification (Catechismus concil. Trident., n. 4, ex <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, <a href="../fathers/1303.htm">"De Catechizandis rudibus"</a>). The subject may be treated under the following headings:

<ul> <li><a href="../cathen/13295a.htm#I">The necessity and the nature of the sacramental system</a> <li><a href="../cathen/13295a.htm#II">The nature of the sacraments of the new law</a> <li><a href="../cathen/13295a.htm#III">The origin (cause) of the sacraments</a> <li><a href="../cathen/13295a.htm#IV">The number of the sacraments</a> <li><a href="../cathen/13295a.htm#V">The effects of the sacraments</a> <li><a href="../cathen/13295a.htm#VI">The minister of the sacraments</a> <li><a href="../cathen/13295a.htm#VII">The recipient of the sacraments</a> </ul>

<h2 id="i">Necessity and nature</h2>
<h3 id="A">In what sense necessary</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> can and does give <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in answer to their internal aspirations and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> without the use of any external sign or <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. This will always be possible, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are spiritual beings. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not restricted to the use of material, visible symbols in dealing with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; the sacraments are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in the sense that they could not have been dispensed with. But, if it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has appointed external, visible <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> as the means by which certain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> are to be conferred on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, then in order to obtain those <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> it will be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to make use of those Divinely appointed means. This <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> express by saying that the sacraments are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, not absolutely but only hypothetically, i.e., in the supposition that if we wish to obtain a certain <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end we must use the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> means appointed for obtaining that end. In this sense the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. VII, can. 4) declared <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> those who assert that the sacraments of the New Law are superfluous and not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, although all are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. It is the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in general that, whilst <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was nowise bound to make use of external <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> as symbols of things spiritual and sacred, it has pleased Him to do so, and this is the ordinary and most suitable manner of dealing with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Writers on the sacraments refer to this as the <em>necessitas convenientiae</em>, the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of suitableness. It is not really a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, but the most appropriate manner of dealing with creatures that are at the same time spiritual and corporeal. In this assertion all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are united: it is only when we come to consider the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the sacramental signs that <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> (except some <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a>) differ from <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. "To sacraments considered merely as outward forms, pictorial representations or symbolic acts, there is generally no objection", wrote Dr. Morgan Dix ("The sacramental system", New York, 1902, p. 16). "Of sacramental <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> this may be said, that it is co-extensive with historic <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Of this there is no reasonable <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, as regards the very ancient days, of which <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom's</a> treatise on the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and St. Cyril's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> lectures may be taken as characteristic documents. Nor was it otherwise with the more conservative of the reformed bodies of the sixteenth century. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Martin Luther's</a> Catechism, the Augsburg, and later the Westminster, Confessions are strongly sacramental in their tone, putting to shame the degenerate followers of those who compiled them" (ibid., p. 7, 8)
<h3 id="B">Why the sacramental system is most appropriate</h3>

<p>The reasons underlying a sacramental system are as follows: <ul><li>Taking the word "sacrament" in its broadest sense, as the sign of something sacred and hidden (the Greek word is "mystery"), we can say that the whole world is a vast sacramental system, in that material things are unto <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> of things spiritual and sacred, even of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Divinity</a>. "The heavens show forth the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> declareth the work of his hands" (<a href="../bible/psa018.htm#vrs2">Psalm 18:2</a>). The invisible things of him [i.e. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>], from the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a> of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made; his <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> power also, and divinity" (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#vrs20">Romans 1:20</a>). <li>The <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was not accomplished in an invisible manner. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> renewed, through the <a href="../cathen/11548a.htm">Patriarchs</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">Prophets</a>, the promise of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> made to the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first man</a>; external symbols were used to express <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the promised Redeemer: "all these things happened to them [the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>] in figure" (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#vrs11">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>; <a href="../bible/heb010.htm#vrs1">Hebrews 10:1</a>). "So we also, when we were children, were serving under the elements of the world. But when the fullness of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> was come, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent his Son, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>" (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#vrs3">Galatians 4:3-4</a>). The <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> took place because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> dealt with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in the manner that was best suited to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. <li>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> established by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> was to be a visible organization (see CHURCH: <em>The Visibility of the Church</em>): consequently it should have external <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> and symbols of things sacred. <li>The principal reason for a sacramental system is found in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. It is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, writes <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<a href="../summa/4061.htm#article1">III:61:1</a>), to be led by things corporeal and sense-perceptible to things spiritual and intelligible; now <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> provides for everything in accordance with its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (<em>secundum modum suae conditionis</em>); therefore it is fitting that Divine Wisdom should provide means of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in the form of certain corporeal and sensible signs which are called sacraments. (For other reasons see Catech. Conc. Trid., II, n.14.) </ul>

<h3 id="C">Existence of sacred symbols</h3>

<p><em>(a) No sacraments in the state of innocence</em>. According to <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<a href="../summa/4061.htm#article2">III:61:2</a>) and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> generally there were no sacraments before Adam <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, i.e., in the state of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> dignity was so great that he was raised above the natural <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. His <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> was subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; his lower <a href="../cathen/05749a.htm">faculties</a> were subject to the higher part of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>; his body was subject to his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; it would have been against the dignity of that state had he been dependent, for the acquisition of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>, on anything beneath him, i.e., corporeal things. For this reason the majority of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> hold that no sacraments would have been instituted even if that state had lasted for a long time.

<p><em>(b) Sacraments of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">law of nature</a></em>. Apart from what was or might have been in that extraordinary state, the use of sacred symbols is universal. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> says that every religion, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, has its visible <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> or sacraments. "In nullum nomen religionis, seu verum seu falsum, coadunari homines possunt, nisi aliquo signaculorum seu sacramentorum visibilium consortio colligantur" (<a href="../fathers/140619.htm"><em>Reply to Faustus</em> XIX.11</a>). Commentators on the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptures</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> almost unanimously assert that there were sacraments under the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">law of nature</a> and under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a>, as there are sacraments of greater dignity under the Law of Christ. Under the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">law of nature</a> &#151; so called not to exclude <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> but because at that time there existed no written <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> &#151; <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was granted through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the promised Redeemer, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> expressed that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by some external <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a>. What those <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> should be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did not determine, leaving this for the people, most probably to the leaders or heads of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, who were guided in their choice by an interior inspiration of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. This is the conception of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, who says that, as under the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">law of nature</a> (when there was no written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>), <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were guided by interior inspiration in worshiping <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so also they determined what <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> should be used in the external acts of worship (<a href="../summa/4060.htm#article5">III:60:5, ad 3</a>). Afterwards, however, as it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to give a written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: (a) because the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">law of nature</a> had been obscured by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and (b) because it was time to give a more explicit <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, then also it became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to determine what external <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> should be used as sacraments (<a href="../summa/4060.htm#article5">III:60:5, ad 3</a>; <a href="../summa/4061.htm#article3">III:61:3, ad 2</a>) This was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> immediately after the Fall, by reason of the fullness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> imparted to Adam. But about the time of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, when <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> had been weakened, many had fallen into <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, and the light of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> had been obscured by indulgence of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, even unto the commission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> intervened and appointed as a sign of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> (<a href="../bible/gen017.htm">Genesis 17</a>; <a href="../summa/4070.htm#article2"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III:70:2, ad 1</a>; see <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">CIRCUMCISION</a>).

<p>The vast majority of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> teach that this <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> was a sacrament and that it was instituted as a remedy for <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>; consequently that it conferred <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not indeed of itself (<em>ex opere operato</em>), but by reason of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> which it expressed. "In circumcisione conferebatur gratia, non ex virtute circumcisionis, sed ex virtute fidei passionis Christi futurae, cujus signum erat circumcisio &#151; quia scilicet justitia erat ex fide significata, non ex circumcisione significante" (<a href="../summa/4070.htm#article4"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III:70:4</a>). Certainly it was at least a sign of something sacred, and it was appointed and determined by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> himself as a sign of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and as a mark by which the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> were distinguished from unbelievers. It was not, however, the only sign of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> used under the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">law of nature</a>. It is incredible, writes <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, that before <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> there was no sacrament for the relief (<a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>) of children, although for some good reason the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptures</a> do not tell us what that sacrament was (<a href="../fathers/15093y.htm"><em>Against Julian</em> III.11</a>). The sacrifice of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>, the sacrifice of the friends of <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a>, the various <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> and oblations for the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are mentioned by <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<a href="../summa/4061.htm#article3">III:61:3, ad 3</a>; <a href="../summa/4065.htm#article1">III:65:1, ad 7</a>) as external observances which may be considered as the sacred <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> of that time, prefiguring future sacred institutions: hence, he adds, they may be called sacraments of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">law of nature</a>.

<p><em>(c) Sacraments of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a></em>. As the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming drew nearer, in order that the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> might be better instructed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealing</a> to him in detail the sacred <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> and <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> by which they were to manifest more explicitly their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the future Redeemer. Those <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> and <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> were the sacraments of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a>, "which are compared to the sacraments which were before the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> as something determined to something undetermined, because before the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> it had not been determined what <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> should use" (<a href="../summa/4061.htm#article3"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III:61:3, ad 2</a>).

<h2 id="ii">Nature of the sacraments of the New Law</h2>
<h3 id="A">Definition of a sacrament</h3>

<p>The sacraments thus far considered were merely <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> of sacred things. According to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, accepted today by many <a href="../cathen/12493a.htm">Episcopalians</a>, the sacraments of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian dispensation</a> are not mere <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a>; they do not merely signify <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>, but in virtue of their Divine institution, they <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. "Signum sacro sanctum efficax gratiae" &#151; a sacrosanct sign producing <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, is a good, succinct definition of a sacrament of the New Law. Sacrament, in its broadest acceptation, may be defined as an external sign of something sacred. In the twelfth century <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> (d. 1164), known as the Master of the Sentences, author of the manual of systematized <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, gave an accurate definition of a sacrament of the New Law: A sacrament is in such a manner an outward sign of inward <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that it bears its image (i.e. signifies or represents it) and is its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> &#151; "Sacramentum proprie dicitur quod ita signum est gratiae Dei, ei invisibilis gratiae forma, ut ipsius imaginem gerat et causa existat" (IV Sent., d.I, n.2). This definition was adopted and perfected by the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">medieval Scholastics</a>. From <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> we have the short but very expressive definition: The sign of a sacred thing in so far as it sanctifies <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> - "Signum rei sacrae in quantum est sanctificans homines" (<a href="../summa/4060.htm#article2">III.60.2</a>).

<p>All the creatures of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> proclaim something sacred, namely, the wisdom and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as they are sacred in themselves, not as they are sacred things sanctifying <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, hence they cannot be called sacraments in the sense in which we speak of sacraments (<a href="../summa/4060.htm#article2">III.60.2, ad 1um</a>). The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> includes the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of these two definitions in the following: "Symbolum rei sacrae, et invisibilis gratiae forma visibilis, sanctificandi vim habens" &#151; A symbol of something sacred, a visible <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> of invisible <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, having the power of sanctifying (Sess. XIII, cap.3). The <a href="../cathen/13120c.htm">"Catechism of the Council of Trent"</a> gives a more complete definition: Something perceptible by the senses which by Divine institution has the power both to signify and to effect <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> (II, n.2). <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> catechisms in English usually have the following: An outward <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign</a> of inward <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, a sacred and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> sign or <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by Christ, by which <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is conveyed to our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> and <a href="../cathen/12493a.htm">Episcopalian</a> theologies and catechisms give definitions which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> could accept.

<p>In every sacrament three things are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>: the outward sign; the inward <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; Divine institution. A sign stands for and represents something else, either naturally, as smoke represents fire, or by the choice of an intelligent being, as the red cross indicates an ambulance. Sacraments do not naturally signify <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; they do so because they have been chosen by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to signify <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> effects. Yet they are not altogether arbitrary, because in some cases, if not in all, the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> performed have a quasi-natural connection with the effect to be produced. Thus, pouring water on the head of a child readily brings to mind the interior purification of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The word "sacrament" (<em>sacramentum</em>), even as used by <a href="../cathen/09032a.htm">profane Latin</a> writers, signified something sacred, viz., the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> by which soldiers were bound, or the money deposited by litigants in a contest. In the writings of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> the word was used to signify something sacred and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a>, and where the Latins use <em>sacramentum</em> the Greeks use <em>mysterion</em> (mystery). The sacred and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> thing signified is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>, which is the formal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> (see <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">GRACE</a>), but with it we must associate the <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">Passion of Christ</a> (efficient and <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>) and the end (final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>) of our sanctification, viz., <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">eternal life</a>. The significance of the sacraments according to <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologians</a> (e.g. <a href="../summa/4060.htm#article3"><em>Summa Theologic&aelig;</em> III.60.3</a>) and the <a href="../cathen/13120c.htm">Roman Catechism</a> (II, n. 13) extends to these three sacred things, of which one is past, one present, and one future. The three are aptly expressed in <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas's</a> beautiful <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphon</a> on the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Eucharist</a>: "O sacrum convivium, in quo Christus sumitur, recolitur memoria passionis ejus, mens impletur gratia, et futurae gloriae nobis pignus datur &#151; O sacred banquet, in which Christ is received, the memory of the passion is recalled, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is filled with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and a pledge of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">future life</a> is given to us".
<h3 id="B">Errors of Protestants</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> generally hold that the sacraments are <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> of something sacred (<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>), but deny that they really <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>. <a href="../cathen/12493a.htm">Episcopalians</a>, however, and <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a>, especially the <a href="../cathen/13090a.htm">Ritualists</a>, hold with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> that the sacraments are "effectual <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a>" of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. In article XXV of the Westminster Confession we read: <blockquote>Sacraments <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be not only badges or tokens of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> men's profession, but rather they be <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> sure <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> and effectual <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> good will towards us by which He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken but strengthen and confirm our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him (cf. art. XXVII). </blockquote>

<p>"The <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwinglian</a> theory", writes Morgan Dix (op. cit., p. 73), "that sacraments are nothing but memorials of Christ and badges of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> profession, is one that can by no possible jugglery with the English tongue be reconciled with the <a href="../cathen/06141a.htm">formularies</a> of our church." Mortimer adopts and explains the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> formula "<em>ex opere operato</em>" (loc. cit., p. 122). <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and his early followers rejected this conception of the sacraments. They do not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but are merely "signs and testimonies of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> good will towards us" (Augsburg Confessions); they excite <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (fiduciary) causes <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>. <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> and <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterians</a> hold substantially the same <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwinglius</a> lowered still further the dignity of the sacraments, making them <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> fidelity but of our fidelity. By receiving the sacraments we manifest <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: they are merely the badges of our profession and the pledges of our fidelity. Fundamentally all these <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> arise from <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> newly-invented theory of righteousness, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone (see <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">GRACE</a>). If <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is to be sanctified not by an interior renovation through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which will blot out his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but by an extrinsic imputation through the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which will cover his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as a cloak, there is no place for <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and those used can have no other purpose than to excite <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> convenient <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> was not adopted by all his followers and it is not baldly and boldly proclaimed by all <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> today; nevertheless they accept its consequences affecting the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> notion of the sacraments.
<h3 id="C">Catholic doctrine</h3>

<p>Against all innovators the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> declared: "If anyone say that the sacraments of the New Law do not contain the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which they signify, or that they do not confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> on those who place no obstacle to the same, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>" (Sess. viii, can.vi). "If anyone say that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not conferred by the sacraments ex opere operato but that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> promises is alone sufficient for obtaining <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>" (ibid., can. viii; cf. can. iv, v, vii). The phrase "ex opere operato", for which there is no equivalent in English, probably was used for the first time by <a href="../cathen/11773b.htm">Peter of Poitiers</a> (d. 1205), and afterwards by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> (d. 1216; de myst. missae, III, v), and by <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (d. 1274; IV Sent., dist. 1, Q.i, a.5). It was happily invented to express a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that had always been taught and had been introduced without objection. It is not an elegant formula but, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> remarks (<a href="../fathers/1801138.htm"><em>Enarration on Psalm 138</em></a>): It is better that grammarians should object than that the people should not understand. "Ex opere operato", i.e. by virtue of the action, means that the efficacy of the action of the sacraments does not depend on anything <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, but solely on the will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as expressed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> institution and promise. "Ex opere operantis", i.e. by reason of the agent, would mean that the action of the sacraments depended on the worthiness either of the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> or of the recipient (see Pourrat, "Theology of the Sacraments", tr. St. Louis, 1910, 162 sqq.). <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> cannot in <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a> object to the phrase as if it meant that the mere outward <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, apart from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> action, causes <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. It is well known that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> teach that the sacraments are only the instrumental, not the principal, causes of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Neither can it be claimed that the phrase adopted by the council does away with all dispositions <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> on the part of the recipient, the sacraments acting like infallible charms causing <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in those who are ill-disposed or in grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The fathers of the council were careful to note that there must be no obstacle to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> on the part of the recipients, who must receive them <em>rite</em>, i.e. rightly and worthily; and they declare it a <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> to assert that they require no previous dispositions (Sess. XIV, de poenit., cap.4). Dispositions are required to prepare the subject, but they are a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> (<em>conditio sine qua non</em>), not the causes, of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> conferred. In this case the sacraments differ from the <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a>, which may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> <em>ex opere operantis</em>, i.e. by reason of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or the good, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> sentiments of those who use them.
<h3 id="D">Proofs of the Catholic doctrine</h3>

<p>In examining <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> it must be borne in mind that our <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a> is not simply <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, but <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> and <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a>.

<p>(a) In <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> we find expressions which clearly indicate that the sacraments are more than mere <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: "Unless a man be born again of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, he cannot enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs5">John 3:5</a>); "He <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a> us, by the laver of <a href="../cathen/12714a.htm">regeneration</a>, and renovation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>" (<a href="../bible/tit003.htm#vrs5">Titus 3:5</a>); "Then they laid their hands upon them, and they received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>" (<a href="../bible/act008.htm#vrs17">Acts 8:17</a>); "He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, hath everlasting life . . . For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed" (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#vrs55">John 6:55-56</a>). These and similar expressions (see articles on each sacrament) are, to say the least, very much exaggerated if they do not mean that the sacramental <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> is in some sense the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> conferred.

<p>(b) <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Tradition</a> clearly indicates the sense in which they have been interpreted in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. From the numerous expressions used by the Fathers we select the following: "The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> comes down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and hovers over the waters, sanctifying them of Himself, and thus they imbibe the power of sanctifying" (<a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, <a href="../fathers/0321.htm"><em>On Baptism</em> 4</a>). "<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the expiation of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, the remission of crimes, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of renovation and <a href="../cathen/12714a.htm">regeneration</a>" (<a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a>, <a href="../fathers/2910.htm"><em>On the Baptism of Christ</em></a>).

<p>(c) Theological argument. &#151; The Westminster Confession adds: "The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of children is in any wise to be retained in the church as most agreeable with the institution of Christ". If <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> does not confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> <em>ex opere operato</em>, but simply excites <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, then we ask: (1) Of what use would this be if the language used be not understood by the recipient, i.e. an infant or an adult that does not understand Latin? In such cases it might be more beneficial to the bystanders than to the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. (2) In what does the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Christ surpass the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a>, for the latter could excite <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Why were those <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> rebaptized with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of Christ? (<a href="../bible/act019.htm">Acts 19</a>). (3) How can it be said that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is strictly <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> since <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be excited and expressed in many other ways? Finally <a href="../cathen/12493a.htm">Episcopalians</a> and <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> of today would not revert to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> ex opere operato unless they were convinced that the ancient <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was warranted by <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> and <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Tradition</a>.
<h3 id="E">Matter and form of the sacraments</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> writers of the thirteenth century introduced into their explanations of the sacraments terms which were derived from the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>. <a href="../cathen/15631d.htm">William of Auxerre</a> (d. 1223) was the first to apply to them the words <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> (<em>materia</em>) and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> (<em>forma</em>). As in physical bodies, so also in the sacramental <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> we find two elements, one undetermined, which is called the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, the other determining, called the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. For instance, water may be used for drinking, or for cooling or cleansing the body, but the words pronounced by the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> when he pours water on the head of the child, with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of doing what the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does, determines the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a>, so that it signifies the purification of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> (the <em>res et verba</em>) make up the external <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a>, which has its special significance and efficacy from the institution of Christ. The words are the more important element in the composition, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> express their thoughts and <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intentions</a> principally by words. "Verba inter homines obtinuerunt principatum significandi" (St. Augustine, <a href="../fathers/12022.htm"><em>Christian Doctrine</em> II.3</a>; <a href="../summa/4060.htm#article6"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III.60.6</a>). It must not be supposed that the things used for the acts performed, for they are included in the res, remarks <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> <a href="../summa/4060.htm#article6">(<em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III.60.6, ad 2)</a> have no significance. They too may be symbolical, e.g. anointing the body with oil relates to health; but their significance is clearly determined by the words. "In all the compounds of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> the determining element is the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>: (<a href="../summa/4060.htm#article7"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III.60.7</a>).

<p>The terminology was somewhat new, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was old; the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> had been expressed in former times in different words. Sometimes the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> of the sacrament meant the whole external <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> (St. Augustine, <a href="../fathers/15011.htm"><em>Of Sin and Merit</em> I.34</a>; Council of Mileve, De bapt.). What we call the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> were referred to as "mystic symbols"; "the sign and the thing invisible"; the "word and the element" (St. Augustine, <a href="../fathers/1701080.htm">Tractate 80 on the Gospel of John</a>). The new terminology immediately found favour. It was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> ratified by being used in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> for the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, which was added to the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decrees</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>, yet has not the value of a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">definition</a> (see <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, 695; <a href="../cathen/07583c.htm">Hurter</a>, "Theol. dog. comp.", I, 441; Pourrat, op. cit., p. 51). The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> used the words <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> (Sess. XIV, cap. ii, iii, can. iv), but did not <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">define</a> that the sacramental <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> was composed of these two elements. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/01644a.htm">"Apostolicae Curae"</a> (13 Sept., 1896) made the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic</a> theory the basis of his declaration, and pronounced ordinations performed according to the <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">ancient Anglican rite</a> invalid, owing to a defect in the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> used and a lack of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>. The hylomorphistic theory furnishes a very apt comparison and sheds much light on our conception of the external <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. Nevertheless our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the sacraments is not dependent on this <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> terminology, and the comparison must not be carried too far. The attempt to verify the comparison (of sacraments to a body) in all details of the sacramental <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> will lead to confusing subtilities or to singular opinions, e.g., <a href="../cathen/03251a.htm">Melchior Cano's</a> (De locis theol., VIII, v.3) opinion as to the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Matrimony</a> (see <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">MARRIAGE</a>; cf. Pourrat, op. cit., ii).

<h2 id="iii">Origin (cause) Of the sacraments</h2>

<p>It might now be asked: in how far was it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> of the sacraments should have been determined by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>?
<h3 id="A">Power of God</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> that the seven sacraments of the New Law were instituted by Christ (Sess. VII, can.i). This settles the question of fact for all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> tells us that all sacraments must come originally from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Since they are the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> of sacred things in so far as by these sacred things <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are sanctified (<a href="../summa/4060.htm#article2"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III:60:2</a>); since the external <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> (<a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>) of itself cannot give <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it is evident that all sacraments properly so called must originate in Divine appointment. "Since the sanctification of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is in the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who sanctifies", writes <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<a href="../summa/4060.htm#article2"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III:60:2</a>), "it is not in the competency of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to choose the things by which he is to be sanctified, but this must be determined by Divine institution". Add to this that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is, in some sense, a participation of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (see <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">GRACE</a>) and our <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> becomes unassailable: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> that by exterior <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> shall be partakers of His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.
<h3 id="B">Power of Christ</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is the principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the sacraments. He alone authoritatively and by innate power can give to external material <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> the power to confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Christ as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, equally with the Father, possessed this principal, authoritative, innate power. As <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> He had another power which <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> calls "the power of the principal <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministry</a>" or "the power of excellence" (<a href="../summa/4064.htm#article3">III:64:3</a>). "Christ produced the interior effects of the sacraments by <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meriting</a> them and by effecting them. . . The <a href="../cathen/11327b.htm">passion of Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> meritoriously and effectively, not as the principal agent and authoritatively but as an instrument, inasmuch as His Humanity was the instrument of His Divinity" (<a href="../summa/4064.htm#article3">III:64:3</a>; cf. <a href="../summa/4013.htm#article1">III:13:1</a>, <a href="../summa/4013.htm#article3">III:13:3</a>). There is <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> in the old maxim: "From the side of Christ dying on the cross flowed the sacraments by which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a>" (Gloss. Ord. in Rom. 5: <a href="../summa/4062.htm#article5"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III:62:5</a>). The principal efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to whom the Humanity of Christ is as a conjoined instrument, the sacraments being instruments not joined to the Divinity (by <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a>): therefore the saving power of the sacraments passes from the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, through His Humanity into the sacraments (<a href="../summa/4062.htm#article5"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III:62:5</a>). One who weighs well all these words will understand why <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have great reverence for the sacraments. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> power of excellence consists in four things: (1) Sacraments have their efficacy from His <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> and sufferings; (2) they are sanctified and they sanctify in His name; (3) He could and He did institute the sacraments; (4) He could produce the effects of the sacraments without the external <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> (<a href="../summa/4064.htm#article3"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III:64:3</a>). Christ could have communicated this power of excellence to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: this was not absolutely impossible (<a href="../summa/4064.htm#article4">III:64:4</a>). But, (1) had He done so <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> could not have possessed it with the same <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfection</a> as Christ: "He would have remained the head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> principally, others secondarily" (<a href="../summa/4064.htm#article3">III:64:3</a>). (2) Christ did not communicate this power, and this for the good of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>: (a) that they might place their <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and not in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; (b) that there might not be different sacraments, giving rise to divisions in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (<a href="../summa/4064.htm#article1">III:64:1</a>). This second reason is mentioned by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#vrs12">1 Corinthians 1:12-13</a>): "every one of you saith: I indeed am of Paul; and I am of Apollo; and I of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Cephas</a>; and I of Christ. Is Christ divided? Was Paul then crucified for you? Or were you <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of Paul?"
<h3 id="C">Immediate or mediate institution</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> did not <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">define</a> explicitly and formally that all the sacraments were instituted immediately by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Before the council great <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, e.g. <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> (IV Sent., d. xxiii), <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a> (De sac. II, ii) <a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a> (Summa, IV, Q. xxiv, 1) held that some sacraments were instituted by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, using power that had been given to them by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">Doubts</a> were raised especially about <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">Confirmation</a> and <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> rejects the opinion that <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">Confirmation</a> was instituted by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. It was instituted by Christ, he holds, when he promised to send the <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Paraclete</a>, although it was never administered whilst He was on earth, because the fullness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was not to be given until after the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>: "Christus instituit hoc sacramentum, non exhibendo, sed promittendo" (<a href="../summa/4062.htm#article1"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III.62.1, ad 1um</a>). The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> that the <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">sacrament of Extreme Unction</a> was instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by <a href="../cathen/08275b.htm">St. James</a> (Sess. XIV, can.i). Some <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, e.g. Becanus, <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, <a href="../cathen/15275a.htm">Vasquez</a>, <a href="../cathen/06634a.htm">Gonet</a>, etc. thought the words of the council (Sess. VII, can.i) were explicit enough to make the immediate institution of all the sacraments by Christ a matter of <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. They are opposed by <a href="../cathen/14152a.htm">Soto</a> (a <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of the council), <a href="../cathen/05547a.htm">Estius</a>, <a href="../cathen/16041d.htm">Gotti</a>, <a href="../cathen/14800a.htm">Tourn&eacute;ly</a>, <a href="../cathen/02522a.htm">Berti</a>, and a host of others, so that now nearly all <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> unite in saying: it is theologically <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, but not <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> (<em>de fide</em>) that Christ immediately instituted all the sacraments of the New Law. In the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> "Lamentabili", 3 July, 1907, <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> condemned twelve propositions of the <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernists</a>, who would attribute the origin of the sacraments to some <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of evolution or development. The first sweeping proposition is this: "The sacraments had their origin in this that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, persuaded and moved by circumstances and events, interpreted some <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> and <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of Christ", (Demzinger-Bannwart, 2040). Then follow eleven propositions relating to each of the sacraments in order (ibid., 2041-51). These propositions deny that Christ immediately instituted the sacraments and some seem to deny even their mediate institution by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>.
<h3 id="D">What does immediate institution imply? Power of the Church.</h3>

<p>Granting that Christ immediately instituted all the sacraments, it does not necessarily follow that personally He determined all the details of the sacred <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, prescribing minutely every iota relating to the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> to be used. It is sufficient (even for immediate institution) to say: Christ determined what special <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> were to be conferred by means of external <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>: for some sacraments (e.g. <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Eucharist</a>) He determined minutely (<em>in specie</em>) the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>: for others He determined only in a general way (<em>in genere</em>) that there should be an external <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, by which special <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> were to be conferred, leaving to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> or to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the power to determine whatever He had not determined, e.g. to prescribe the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> of the Sacraments of <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">Confirmation</a> and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXI, cap. ii) declared that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had the power to change the "substance" of the sacraments. She would not be claiming power to alter the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the sacraments if she used her Divinely given authority to determine more precisely the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> in so far as they had not been determined by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. This theory (which is not modern) had been adopted by <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>: by it we can solve historical difficulties relating, principally, to <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">Confirmation</a> and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a>.
<h3 id="E">May we then say that Christ instituted some sacraments in an implicit state?</h3>

<p>That Christ was satisfied to lay down the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> principles from which, after a more or less protracted development, would come forth the fully developed sacraments? This is an application of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> theory of development, according to Pourrat (op. cit., p. 300), who proposes two other formulae; Christ instituted all the sacraments immediately, but did not himself give them all to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> fully constituted; or <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> instituted immediately and explicitly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>: He instituted immediately but implicitly the five other sacraments (loc. cit., p. 301). Pourrat himself thinks the latter formula too absolute. <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> probably will consider it rather dangerous, and at least "<em>male sonans</em>". If it be taken to mean more than the old expression, Christ determined <em>in genere</em> only the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> of some sacraments, it grants too much development. If it means nothing more than the expression hitherto in use, what is gained by admitting a formula which easily might be misunderstood?

<h3 id="A">Catholic doctrine: Eastern and Western Churches</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> that there are seven sacraments of the New Law, truly and properly so called, viz., <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">Confirmation</a>, <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Penance</a>, <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Orders</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Matrimony</a>. The same enumeration had been made in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> for the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> (1439), in the Profession of Faith of Michael Palaelogus, offered to <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> in the Council of Lyons (1274) and in the council held at <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, in 1237, under Otto, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. According to some writers Otto of Bamberg (1139), the Apostle of <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>, was the first who clearly adopted the number seven (see Tanquerey, "De sacr."). Most probably this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> (d. 1164) who in his fourth Book of Sentences (d. i, n.2) defines a sacrament as a sacred <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign</a> which not only signifies but also causes <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and then (d.ii, n.1) enumerates the seven sacraments. It is worthy of note that, although the great <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> rejected many of his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> opinions (list given in app. to <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> edition, Paris, 1841), this definition and enumeration were at once universally accepted, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> positive that he did not introduce a new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, but merely expressed in a convenient and precise formula what had always been held in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Just as many doctrines were <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, but not always accurately expressed, until the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> or the development of religious <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> called forth a neat and precise formula, so also the sacraments were accepted and used by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for centuries before <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelian</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, applied to the systematic explanation of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>, furnished the accurate definition and enumeration of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>. The earlier <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were more concerned with the use of sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> than with scientific formulae, being like the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> author of the <a href="../cathen/07674c.htm">"Imitation of Christ"</a>, who wrote: "I had rather feel compunction than <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> its definition" (I, i).

<p>Thus <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> was required, not for the development of the sacraments - except in so far as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may have determined what was left under her control by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> &#151; but for the growth and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the sacraments. For many centuries all <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> of sacred things were called sacraments, and the enumeration of these <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> was somewhat arbitrary. Our seven sacraments were all mentioned in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>, and we find them all mentioned here and there by the Fathers (see THEOLOGY; and articles on each sacrament). After the ninth century, writers began to draw a distinction between sacraments in a general sense and sacraments properly so called. The ill-fated <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> ("Intro. ad Theol.", I, i, and in the "Sic et Non") and <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a> (De sacr., I, part 9, chap. viii; cf. Pourrat, op. cit., pp.34, 35) prepared the way for <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, who proposed the precise formula which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> accepted. Thenceforward until the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of the so-called <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> joined with the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> in saying: by sacraments proper we understand efficacious sacred <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> which by Divine ordinance signify, contain and confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and they are seven in number. In the history of conferences and councils held to effect the reunion of the Greek with the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, we find no record of objections made to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of seven sacraments. On the contrary, about 1576, when the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> of <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>, anxious to draw the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a> into their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, sent a Greek translation of the Augsburg Confession to Jeremias, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, he replied: "The <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> received in this same <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and the sacred <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>, are seven in number &#151; just seven and no more" (Pourrat, op. cit., p. 289). The consensus of the Greek and Latin Churches on this subject is clearly shown by Arcadius, "De con. ecc. occident. et orient. in sept. sacr. administr." (1619); Goar in his "Euchologion" by Martene in his work "De antiquis ecclesiae ritibus", by <a href="../cathen/12769a.htm">Renaudot</a> in his "Perpetuite de la foi sur sacrements" (1711), and this agreement of the two Churches furnishes recent writers (<a href="../cathen/12493a.htm">Episcopalians</a>) with a strong argument in support of their appeal for the acceptance of seven sacraments.
<h3 id="B">Protestant errors</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> capital <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, viz. private interpretation of the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptures</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> led to a rejection of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> on the sacraments (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">LUTHER</a>; <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">GRACE</a>). Gladly would he have swept them all away, but the words of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> were too convincing and the Augsburg Confession retained three as "having the command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the promise of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>". These three, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, the Lord's Supper, and <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Penance</a> were admitted by <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and also by Cranmer in his "Catechism" (see Dix, "op. cit.", p. 79). <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> protested against <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> innovations and received the title "Defender of the Faith" as a reward for publishing the "Assertio septem sacramentorum" (re-edited by Rev. Louis O'Donovan, New York, 1908). Followers of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> principles surpassed their leader in opposition to the sacraments. Once granted that they were merely "signs and testimonies of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> good will towards us", the reason for great <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">reverence</a> was gone. Some rejected all sacraments, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> good will could be manifested without these external <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a>. <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Confession (Penance)</a> was soon dropped from the list of those retained. The <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a> rejected infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> could not excite <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in children. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> generally retained two sacraments, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and the Lord's Supper, the latter being reduced by the denial of the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a> to a mere commemorative service. After the first fervour of destruction there was a reaction. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> retained a <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">Confirmation</a> and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>. Cranmer retained three sacraments, yet we find in the Westminster Confession: "There are two Sacraments <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Our Lord</a> in the Gospel, that is to say, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, and the Supper of the Lord. Those five commonly called sacraments, that is to say <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">Confirmation</a>, <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Penance</a>, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Orders</a>, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Matrimony</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>, are not to be counted for sacraments of the Gospel, being such as have grown partly of the corrupt following of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, partly are states of life allowed in the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptures</a> but yet have not like <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of sacraments with <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and the Lord's Supper, for that they have not any visible <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> or <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (art. XXV). The <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, by way of compromise, had shown a willingness to make such a distinction, in a second letter to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, but the Greeks would have no compromise (Pourrat, loc. cit., 290).

<p>For more than two centuries the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a> theoretically recognized only two "sacraments of the Gospel" yet permitted, or tolerated other five <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>. In practice these five "lesser sacraments" were neglected, especially <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Penance</a> and <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>. <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> of the nineteenth century would have gladly altered or abolished the twenty-fifth article. There has been a strong desire, dating chiefly from the <a href="../cathen/11370a.htm">Tractarian Movement</a>, and the days of <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Pusey</a>, <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, Lyddon, etc. to reintroduce all of the sacraments. Many <a href="../cathen/12493a.htm">Episcopalians</a> and <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> today make heroic efforts to show that the twenty-fifth article repudiated the lesser sacraments only in so far as they had "grown of the corrupt following of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, and were administered 'more Romamensium'", after the Roman fashion. Thus Morgan Dix reminded his contemporaries that the first book of Edward VI allowed "auricular and secret confession to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>", who could give <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> as well as "ghostly counsel, advice, and comfort", but did not make the practice <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>: therefore the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Absolution</a> is not to be "obtruded upon <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">consciences</a> as a matter <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>" (op. cit., pp.99, 101, 102, 103). He cites authorities who state that "one cannot <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that a sacramental use of anointing the sick has been from the beginning", and adds, "There are not wanting, among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the American <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, some who concur in deploring the loss of this primitive ordinance and predicting its restoration among us at some propitious <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>" (ibid., p. 105). At a convention of <a href="../cathen/12493a.htm">Episcopalians</a> held at <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, in 1910, unsuccessful effort was made to obtain <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> for the practice of anointing the sick. High Church <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curates</a>, especially in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, frequently are in conflict with their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> because the former use all the ancient <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>. Add to this the assertion made by Mortimer (op. cit., I, 122) that all the sacraments <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> <em>ex opere operato</em>, and we see that "advanced" <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> are returning to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and the practices of the Old Church. Whether and in how far their position can be reconciled with the twenty-fifth article, is a question which they must settle. Assuredly their wanderings and gropings after the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of having on earth an <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> interpreter of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> word.
<h3 id="C">Division and comparison of the sacraments</h3>

<p>(a) All sacraments were instituted for the spiritual good of the recipients; but five, viz. <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">Confirmation</a>, <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Penance</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Eucharist</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>, primarily benefit the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> in his private <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>, whilst the other two, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Orders</a> and <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Matrimony</a>, primarily affect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as a social being, and sanctify him in the fulfillment of his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> towards the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. By <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> we are born again, <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">Confirmation</a> makes us strong, perfect <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and soldiers. The <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Eucharist</a> furnishes our daily spiritual food. <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Penance</a> heals the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> wounded by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> removes the last remnant of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frailty, and prepares the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal life</a>, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Orders</a> supplies <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>. <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Matrimony</a> gives the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for those who are to rear children in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> militant, future citizens of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. This is <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas's</a> explanation of the fitness of the number seven (<a href="../summa/4055.htm#article1">III:55:1</a>). He gives other explanations offered by the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a>, but does not bind himself to any of them. In fact the only sufficient reason for the existence of seven sacraments, and no more, is the will of Christ: there are seven because He instituted seven. The explanations and adaptations of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> serve only to excite our admiration and gratitude, by showing how wisely and beneficently <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has provided for our spiritual needs in these seven efficacious signs of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p>(b) <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Penance</a> are called "sacraments of the dead", because they give life, through <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> then called "first grace", to those who are spiritually dead by reason of original or <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">actual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The other five are "sacraments of the living", because their reception presupposes, at least ordinarily, that the recipient is in the state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>, and they give "second grace", i.e. increase of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. Nevertheless, since the sacraments always give some <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> when there is no obstacle in the recipient, it may happen in cases explained by <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> that "second grace" is conferred by a sacrament of the dead, e.g. when one has only venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to confess receives <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> and that "first grace" is conferred by a sacrament of the living (see <a href="../summa/4072.htm#article7"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III:72:7 ad 2</a>; <a href="../summa/4079.htm#article3">III:79:3</a>). Concerning <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> <a href="../cathen/08275b.htm">St. James</a> explicitly states that through it the recipient may be freed from his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: "If he be in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, they shall be forgiven him" (<a href="../bible/jam005.htm#vrs15">James 5:15</a>).

The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> declared that the sacraments are not all equal in dignity; also that none are superfluous, although all are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> (Sess. VII, can.3, 4). The <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Eucharist</a> is the first in dignity, because it contains Christ in person, whilst in the other sacraments <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is conferred by an instrumental virtue derived from Christ (<a href="../summa/4056.htm#article3"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III.56.3</a>) To this reason <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> adds another, namely, that the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Eucharist</a> is as the end to which the other sacraments tend, a centre around which they revolve (<a href="../summa/4056.htm#article3"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III:56:3</a>). <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is always first in <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>; <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a> comes next after the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Eucharist</a> in the order of dignity, <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">Confirmation</a> being between these two. <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Penance</a> and <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> could not have a first place because they presuppose defects (<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>). Of the two <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Penance</a> is the first in <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>: <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> completes the work of <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Penance</a> and prepares <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> for <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Matrimony</a> has not such an important social work as <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Orders</a> (<a href="../summa/4056.htm#article3"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III:56:3, ad 1</a>).

<p>(d) <a href="../cathen/12493a.htm">Episcopalians</a> and <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> distinguish two great sacraments and five lesser sacraments because the latter "have not any visible sign or <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (art. XXXV). Then they should be classed among the <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a> since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can be the author of a sacrament (see above III). On this point the language of the twenty-fifth article ("commonly called sacraments") is more <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> and straightforward than the terminology of recent <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> writers. The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> Catechism calls <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Eucharist</a> sacraments "generally (i.e. universally) <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>". Mortimer justly remarks that this expression is not "entirely accurate", because the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Eucharist</a> is not generally <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in the same way as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> (op. cit., I, 127). The other five he adds are placed in a lower class because, "they are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in the same sense as the two other sacraments, since they are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for everyone" (loc. cit., 128). Verily this is interpretation extraordinary; yet we should be grateful since it is more respectful than saying that those five are "such as have grown partly of the corrupt following of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, partly are states of life allowed in the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptures</a>" (art. XXV). Confusion and uncertainty will be avoided by accepting the declaration of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (above).

<h2 id="v">Effects of the sacraments</h2>
<h3 id="A">Catholic doctrine</h3>

<p>(a) The principal effect of the sacrament is a two-fold <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: (1) the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the sacrament which is "first grace", produced by the sacraments of the dead, or "second grace", produced by the sacraments of the living (supra, IV, 3, b); (2) The sacramental <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, i.e., the special <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> needed to attain the end of each sacrament. Most probably it is not a new habitual <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, but a special vigour or efficacy in the <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> conferred, including on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a promise, and on the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a permanent <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to the assistance needed in order to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> incurred, e.g., to live as a good <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, a good <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, a good husband or wife (cf. <a href="../summa/4062.htm#article2"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III:62:2</a>).

<p>(b) Three sacraments, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">Confirmation</a> and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Orders</a>, besides <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, produce in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> a <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">character</a>, i.e., an indelible <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">spiritual mark</a> by which some are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, some as soldiers, some as <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>. Since it is an indelible mark, the sacraments which impress a character cannot be received more than once (Conc. Trid., sess. VII, can. 9; see <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">CHARACTER</a>).
<h3 id="B">How the sacraments cause grace: theological controversies</h3>

<p>Few questions have been so hotly controverted as this one relative to the manner in which the sacraments <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> (ST IV, Sent., d.1, Q.4, a.1.).

<p>(a) All admit that the sacraments of the New Law <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> <em>ex opere operato</em>, not <em>ex opere operantis</em> (above, II, 2, 3).

<p>(b) All admit that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can be the principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> (above 3, 1).

<p>(c) All admit that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, had a special power over the sacraments (above, 3, 2).

<p>(d) All admit that the sacraments are, in some sense, the instrumental causes either of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> itself or of something else which will be a "title exigent of grace" (<em>infra</em> e). The principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is one which produces an effect by a power which it has by reason of its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or by an inherent faculty. An instrumental <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> produces an effect, not by its own power, but by a power which it receives from the principal agent. When a carpenter makes a table, he is the principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, his tools are the instrumental causes. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as the principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; sacraments can be no more than his instruments "for they are applied to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by Divine ordinance to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in them" (<a href="../summa/4062.htm#article1"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III:62:1</a>). No <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> today defends <a href="../cathen/11195b.htm">Occasionalism</a> (see <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">CAUSE</a>) i.e. the system which taught that the sacraments <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by a kind of concomitance, they being not real causes but the <em>causae sine quibus non</em>: their reception being merely the occasion of conferring <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. This opinion, according to Pourrat (op. cit., 167), was defended by <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a>, Durandus, <a href="../cathen/15636a.htm">Occam</a>, and all the <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalists</a>, and "enjoyed a real success until the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, when it was transformed into the modern system of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>". <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<a href="../summa/4062.htm#article1">III:62:1</a>, <a href="../summa/4062.htm#article4">III:62:4</a>; and "Quodlibeta", 12, a, 14), and others rejected it on the ground that it reduced the sacraments to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of mere <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a>.

<p>(e) In solving the problem the next step was the introduction of the system of dispositive instrumental <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>, explained by <a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a> (Summa theol., IV, Q. v, membr. 4), adopted and perfected by <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (IV Sent., d. 1, Q. i, a. 4), defended by many <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> down to the sixteenth century, and revived later by Father Billot, S.J. ("De eccl. sacram.", I, Rome, 1900). According to this theory the sacraments do not efficiently and immediately <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> itself, but they <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <em>ex opere operato</em> and instrumentally, a something else &#151; the <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">character</a> (in some cases) or a spiritual ornament or <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> &#151; which will be a "disposition" entitling the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> ("dispositio exigitiva gratiae"; "titulus exigitivus gratiae", Billot, loc. cit.). It must be admitted that this theory would be most convenient in explaining "reviviscence" of the sacraments (infra, VII, c). Against it the following objections are made: <ul><li>From the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> down to recent times little was heard of this system. <li>The "ornament", or "disposition", entitling the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not well explained, hence explains very little. <li>Since this "disposition" must be something spiritual and of the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a>, and the sacraments can <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> it, why can they not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> itself? <li>In his <a href="../summa/index.html">"Summa theologica"</a> <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> does not mention this dispositive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>: hence we may reasonably <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he abandoned it. </ul>

<p>(f) Since the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> almost unanimously have taught that the sacraments are the efficient instrumental <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> itself. The <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">definition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, that the sacraments "contain the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which they signify", that they "confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> ex opere operato" (Sess. VII, can.6, 8), seemed to justify the assertion, which was not contested until quite recently. Yet the end of the controversy had not come. What was the nature of that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>? Did it belong to the physical or to the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> order? A physical <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> really and immediately produces its effects, either as the principal agent or as the instrument used, as when a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> uses a chisel to carve a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>. A <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is one which moves or entreats a physical <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to act. It also can be principal or instrumental, e.g., a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who in person successfully pleads for the liberation of a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> is the principal <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, a letter sent by him would be the instrumental <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, of the freedom granted. The expressions used by <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> seem clearly to indicate that the sacraments <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> after the manner of physical causes. He says that there is in the sacraments a virtue productive of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> (<a href="../summa/4062.htm#article4">III:62:4</a>) and he answers objections against attributing such power to a corporeal instrument by simply stating that such power is not inherent in them and does not reside in them permanently, but is in them only so far and so long as they are instruments in the hands of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> (loc. cit., ad um and 3 um). Cajetan, <a href="../cathen/14319a.htm">Francisco Su&aacute;rez</a>, and a host of other great <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> defend this system, which is usually termed <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a>. The language of the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, the expressions of the Fathers, the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decrees</a> of the councils, they say, are so strong that nothing short of an impossibility will justify a denial of this dignity to the sacraments of the New Law. Many facts must be admitted which we cannot fully explain. The body of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acts on his spiritual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; fire acts, in some way, on <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and on <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. The strings of a harp, remarks Cajetan (In III, Q. lxii) touched by an unskilled hand, produce nothing but sounds: touched by the hands of a skilful musician they give forth beautiful melodies. Why cannot the sacraments, as instruments in the hands of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, produce <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>?

<p>Many grave <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> were not convinced by these arguments, and another <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, improperly called the <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotistic</a>, headed by <a href="../cathen/03251a.htm">Melchior Cano</a>, <a href="../cathen/09418b.htm">De Lugo</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15275a.htm">Vasquez</a>, embracing later Henno, <a href="../cathen/14800a.htm">Tourn&eacute;ly</a>, <a href="../cathen/06242a.htm">Franzelin</a>, and others, adopted the system of instrumental <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>. The principal <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">Passion of Christ</a>. The sacraments are instruments which move or entreat <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> effectively and infallibly to give his <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to those who receive them with proper dispositions, because, says <a href="../cathen/03251a.htm">Melchior Cano</a>, "the price of the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is communicated to them" (see Pourrat, op. cit., 192, 193). This system was further developed by <a href="../cathen/06242a.htm">Franzelin</a>, who looks upon the sacraments as being <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morally</a> an act of Christ (loc. cit., p. 194). The <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> and <a href="../cathen/14319a.htm">Francisco Su&aacute;rez</a> object to this system: <ul><li>Since the sacraments (i.e. the external <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>) have no intrinsic value, they do not, according to this explanation, exert any genuine <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>; they do not really <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone causes the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: the sacrament do not operate to produce it; they are only <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> or occasions of conferring it. <li>The Fathers saw something <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> and inexplicable in the sacraments. In this system wonders cease or are, at least, so much reduced that the expressions used by the Fathers seem altogether out of place. <li>This theory does not sufficiently distinguish, in efficacy, the sacraments of the Gospel from the sacraments of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Nevertheless, because it avoids certain difficulties and obscurities of the physical <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> theory, the system of moral <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> has found many defenders, and today if we consider numbers alone, it has authority in its favour.</ul>

<p>Recently both of these systems have been vigorously attacked by Father Billot (op. cit., 107 sq.), who proposes a new explanation. He revives the old theory that the sacraments do not immediately <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> itself, but a disposition or title to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> (above e). This disposition is produced by the sacraments, neither physically nor morally, but imperatively. Sacraments are practical <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> of an intentional order: they manifest <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> to give spiritual benefits; this manifestation of the Divine <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is a title exigent of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> (op. cit., 59 sq., 123 sq.; Pourrat, op. cit., 194; Cronin in reviews, <em>sup. cit.</em>). Father Billot defends his opinions with remarkable acumen. Patrons of the physical <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> gratefully note his attack against the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>, but object to the new explanation, that the imperative or the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intentional</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>, as distinct from the action of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a>, occasions, moral or physical instruments (a) is conceived with difficulty and (b) does not make the sacraments (i.e. the external, Divinely appointed <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>) the real <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> are perfectly free to dispute and differ as to the manner of instrumental <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>. <em>Lis est adhuc sub judice</em>.

<h2 id="vi">Minister of the sacraments</h2>
<h3 id="A">Men, not angels</h3>

<p>It was altogether fitting that the ministration of the sacraments be given, not to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. The efficacy of the sacraments comes from the <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">Passion of Christ</a>, hence from Christ as a man; <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, not <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, are like unto Christ in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">Miraculously</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> might send a good <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to administer a sacrament (<a href="../summa/4064.htm#article7"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III:64:7</a>).
<h3 id="B">Ordination requirements for the ministers of particular sacraments</h3>

<p>For administering <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> validly no special <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> is required. Any one, even a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>, can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, provided that he use the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and pronounce the words of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of doing what the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does (Decr. pro Armen., <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, 696). Only <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and in some cases, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> may confer <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> (see <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">BAPTISM</a>). It is now held as <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that in <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Matrimony</a> the contracting parties are the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the sacrament, because they make the contract and the sacrament is a <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a> raised by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to the dignity of a sacrament (cf. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, <a href="../cathen/01687e.htm">Encyclical "Arcanum"</a>, 10 Febr., 1880; see <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">MATRIMONY</a>). For the validity of the other five sacraments the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> must be duly <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> those who said that all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> could administer all the sacraments (Sess. VII, can.10). Only <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> can confer <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Sacred Orders</a> (Council of Trent, sess. XXIII, can.7). Ordinarily only a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can give <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">Confirmation</a> (see <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">CONFIRMATION</a>). The <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priestly Order</a> is required for the valid administration of <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Penance</a> and <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> (Conc. Trid., sess. XIV, can.10, can.4).

<h3 id="C">Heretical or schismatic ministers</h3>

<p>The care of all those sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> has been given to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">Heretical</a> or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> can administer the sacraments validly if they have valid <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Orders</a>, but their ministrations are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> (see Billot, op. cit., thesis 16). <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">Good faith</a> would excuse the recipients from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and in cases of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> grants <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Penance</a> and <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> (see <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">EXCOMMUNICATION</a>: V, <em>Effects of Excommunication</em>).
<h3 id="D">State of soul of the minister</h3>

<p>Due reverence for the sacraments requires the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> to be in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>: one who <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> and officially administers a sacrament, being himself in a state of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, would certainly be guilty of a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> (cf. <a href="../summa/4064.htm#article6"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III.64.6</a>). Some hold that this <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> is committed even when the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> does not <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> officially or confer the sacrament <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a>. But from the controversy between St. Augustine and the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> in the fourth century and especially from the controversy between <a href="../cathen/14287a.htm">St. Stephen</a> and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> in the third century, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that personal <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> or the state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> is not a prerequisite for the valid administration of the sacrament. This has been <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> in several <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a> including the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess VII, can.12, <em>ibid.</em>, de bapt., can. 4). The reason is that the sacraments have their efficacy by Divine institution and through the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of Christ. Unworthy <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, validly conferring the sacraments, cannot impede the efficacy of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to produce <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> <em>ex opere operato</em> (cf. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, <a href="../summa/4064.htm#article5">III:64:5</a>, <a href="../summa/4064.htm#article9">III:64:9</a>). The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which follows <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> conception of a sacrament, gives comfort to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, and it should increase, rather than diminish, reverence for those sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> and confidence in their efficacy. No one can give, in his own name, that which he does not possess; but a bank cashier, not possessing 2000 dollars in his own name, could write a draft worth 2,000,000 dollars by reason of the wealth of the bank which he is authorized to represent. Christ left to His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> a vast treasure purchased by His <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> and sufferings: the sacraments are as credentials entitling their holders to a share in this treasure. On this subject, the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> has retained the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, which is neatly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in article XXVI of the Westminster Confession: "Although in the visible church the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> be ever mingled with the good, and sometimes the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> hath the chief authority in the ministration of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> and Sacraments, yet forasmuch as they do not the same in their own name, but in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a>, and do <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> by His commission and authority, we may use their <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministry</a> both in hearing the Word of God and in receiving the Sacraments. Neither is the effect of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> ordinance taken away by their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> nor the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">God's gifts</a> from such as by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and rightly, do receive the sacraments ministered unto them; which be effectual, because of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> institution and promise, although they be administered by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>" (cf. Billuart, de sacram., d. 5, a. 3, sol. obj.)
<h3 id="E">Intention of the minister</h3>

<p>(a) To be a <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> of the sacraments under and with Christ, a man must <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> as a man, i.e. as a rational being; hence it is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that he have the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of doing what the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does. This was declared by <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> in 1439 (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, 695) and was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess.VII, can.II). The <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> of Trent was aimed at the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">innovators of the sixteenth century</a>. From their fundamental <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> that the sacraments were <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> that excited <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it followed <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> that their effect in no wise depended on the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a>. <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Men</a> are to be "<a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the dispensers of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#vrs1">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>), and this they would not be without the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, for it is by the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, says <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<a href="../summa/4064.htm#article8">III:64:8, ad 1</a>) that a man subjects and unites himself to the principal agent (<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>). Moreover, by rationally pronouncing the words of the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> must determine what is not sufficiently determined or expressed by the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> applied, e.g. the significance of pouring water on the head of the child (<a href="../summa/4064.htm#article8"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III.64.8</a>). One who is demented, drunk, asleep, or in a stupor that prevents a rational <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a>, one who goes through the external <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> in mockery, mimicry, or in a play, does not <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> as a rational <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a>, hence cannot administer a sacrament.

<p>(b) The <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> object and <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">qualities</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> required in the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> of the sacrament are explained in the article <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">INTENTION</a>. Pourrat (op. cit., ch. 7) gives a history of all controversies on this subject. Whatever may be said speculatively about the opinion of Ambrosius Catherinus* (see <a href="../cathen/12212c.htm">LANCELOT POLITI</a>) who advocated the sufficiency of an external <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a>, it may not be followed in practice, because, outside of cases of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, no one may follow a probable opinion against one that is safer, when there is question of something required for the validity of a sacrament (<a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a>, 1679; Denzinger-Bannwart, 1151).
<h3 id="F">Attention in the minister</h3>

<p>Attention is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, viz. the application of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to what is being done. <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">Voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/05047b.htm">distraction</a> in one administering a sacrament would be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would however not be <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a>, unless (a) there be danger of making a serious mistake, or (b) according to the common opinion, the <a href="../cathen/05047b.htm">distraction</a> be admitted in <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Eucharistic</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Attention on the part of the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the valid administration of a sacrament, because in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, which is presupposed, he can <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> in a rational manner, notwithstanding the <a href="../cathen/05047b.htm">distraction</a>.

<h2 id="vii">Recipient of the sacraments</h2>

<p>When all <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> required by <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine</a> and ecclesiastical law are complied with, the sacrament is received validly and licitly. If all <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> required for the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> are observed, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a>, the recipient, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, but some non-essential <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> is not complied with by the recipient, the sacrament is received validly but not licitly; and if the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> wilfully neglected be grave, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not then conferred by the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> contracting <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Matrimony</a> whilst they are in the state of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would be validly (i.e. really) married, but would not then receive <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>.
<h3 id="A">Conditions for valid reception</h3>

<p>(a) The previous reception of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> (by water) is an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> for the valid reception of any other sacrament. Only citizens and members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can come under her influence as such; <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the door by which we enter the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and thereby become members of a <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystical body</a> united to Christ our head (Catech. Trid., de bapt., nn. 5, 52).

<p>(b) In adults, for the valid reception of any sacrament except the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Eucharist</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that they have the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of receiving it. The sacraments impose <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> and confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: Christ does not wish to impose those <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> or confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> without the <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Eucharist</a> is excepted because, in whatever state the recipient may be, it is always the body and blood of Christ (see <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">INTENTION</a>; cf. Pourrat, op. cit., 392).

<p>(c) For attention, see above, VI, 6. By the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> submits himself to the operation of the sacraments which produce their effects ex opere operato, hence attention is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the valid reception of the sacraments. One who might be <a href="../cathen/05047b.htm">distracted</a>, even <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>, during the conferring, e.g. of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, would receive the sacrament validly. It must be carefully noted, however, that in the case of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Matrimony</a> the contracting parties are the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> as well as the recipients of the sacraments; and in the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Penance</a>, the acts of the penitent, <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, confession, and willingness to accept a <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Penance</a> in satisfaction, constitute the proximate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the sacraments, according to the commonly received opinion. Hence in those cases such attention is required as is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the valid application of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.
<h3 id="B">Conditions for the licit reception</h3>

<p>(a) For the licit reception, besides the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> and the attention, in adults there is required:<ul><li>for the sacraments of the dead, <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/02065a.htm">attrition</a>, which presupposes acts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">repentance</a> (see <a href="../cathen/02065a.htm">ATTRITION</a> and <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">JUSTIFICATION</a>);<li>for the sacraments of the living the state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowingly</a> to receive a sacrament of the living whilst one is in the state of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would be a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>. </ul>

<p>(b) For the licit reception it is also <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to observe all that is prescribed by <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine</a> or ecclesiastical law, e.g. as to <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, place, the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a>, etc. As the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone has the care of the sacraments and generally her duly appointed agents alone have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to administer them, except <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> in some cases, and <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Matrimony</a> (supra VI, 2), it is a general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that application for the sacraments should be made to worthy and duly appointed <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>. (For exceptions see <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">EXCOMMUNICATION</a>.)
<h3 id="C">Reviviscence of the sacraments</h3>

<p>Much attention has been given by <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> to the revival of effects which were impeded at the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> when a sacrament was received. The question arises whenever a sacrament is received validly but unworthily, i.e. with an obstacle which prevents the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>. The obstacle (mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>) is positive, when it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, or negative, when it is involuntary by reason of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a>. One who thus receives a sacrament is said to receive it feignedly, or falsely (<em>ficte</em>), because by the very <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of receiving it he pretends to be properly disposed; and the sacrament is said to be <em>validum sed informe</em> &#151; valid, but lacking its proper <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or charity (see LOVE). Can such a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> recover or receive the effects of the sacraments? The term reviviscence (<em>reviviscentia</em>) is not used by <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> in reference to the sacraments and it is not strictly correct because the effects in question being impeded by the obstacle, were not once "living" (cf. Billot, op. cit., 98, note). The expression which he uses (<a href="../summa/4069.htm#article10">III:69:10</a>), viz., obtaining the effects after the obstacle has been removed, is more accurate, though not so convenient as the newer term.

<p>(a) <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> generally hold that the question does not apply to <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Penance</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>. If the penitent be not sufficiently disposed to receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> he confesses his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> the sacrament is not validly received because the acts of the penitent are a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> part of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this sacrament, or a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> for its reception. One who unworthily receives the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Eucharist</a> can derive no benefit from that sacrament unless, perhaps, he repent of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> before the sacred <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> have been destroyed. Cases that may occur relate to the five other sacraments.

<p>(b) It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> and admitted by all, that if <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> be received by an adult who is in the state of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he can afterwards receive the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> of the sacrament, viz. when the obstacle is removed by <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> or by the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>. On the one hand the sacraments always produce <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> unless there be an obstacle; on the other hand those <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, and yet the sacrament cannot be repeated. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<a href="../summa/4069.htm#article10">III:69:10</a>) and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> find a special reason for the conferring of the effects of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> (when the "fiction" has been removed) in the permanent <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">character</a> which is impressed by the sacrament validly administered. Reasoning from <a href="../cathen/01449a.htm">analogy</a> they hold the same with regard to <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">Confirmation</a> and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a>, noting however that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> to be received are not so <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> as those conferred by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p>(c) The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is not so <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> when applied to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Matrimony</a> and <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>. But since the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> impeded are very important though not strictly <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, and since <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Matrimony</a> cannot be received again whilst both contracting parties are living, and <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> cannot be repeated whilst the same danger of death lasts, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> adopt as more probable the opinion which holds that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will grant the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> of those sacraments when the obstacle is removed. The "reviviscence" of the effects of sacraments received validly but with an obstacle to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> at the time of their reception, is urged as a strong argument against the system of the physical <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> (supra, V, 2), especially by Billot (op. cit., thesis, VII, 116, 126). For his own system he claims the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of establishing an invariable mode of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>, namely, that in every case by the sacrament validly received there is conferred a "title exigent of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>". If there be no obstacle the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is conferred then and there: if there be an obstacle the "title" remains calling for the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which will be conferred as soon as the obstacle is removed (op. cit., th. VI, VII). To this his opponents reply that exceptional cases might well call for an exceptional mode of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>. In the case of three sacraments the <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">character</a> sufficiently explains the revival of effects (cf. <a href="../summa/4066.htm#article1">ST III:66:1</a>, <a href="../summa/4069.htm#article9">III:69:9</a>, <a href="../summa/4069.htm#article10">III:69:10</a>). The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> as applied to <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> and <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Matrimony</a>, is not <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> enough to furnish a strong argument for or against any system. Future efforts of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> may dispel the obscurity and uncertainty now prevailing in this interesting chapter.
