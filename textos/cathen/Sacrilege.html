<h1>Sacrilege</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>sacrilegium</em>, robbing a temple, from <em>sacer</em>, sacred, and <em>legere</em>, to purloin.)

<p>Sacrilege is in general the violation or injurious treatment of a sacred object. In a less proper sense any transgression against the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">virtue of religion</a> would be a sacrilege.

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> are substantially agreed in regarding as sacred that and that only which by a public rite and by Divine or <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institution has been dedicated to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The point is that the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">public authority</a> must intervene; private initiative, no matter how ardent in devotion or praiseworthy in motive, does not suffice. Attributing a sacred character to a thing is a juridical act, and as such is a function of the governing power of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>It is customary to enumerate three kinds of sacrilege: personal, local, and real. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> teaches (Summa, II-II, Q., xcix) that a different sort of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> attaches to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, places, and things. Hence the irreverence offered to any one of them is specifically distinct from that which is exhibited to the others. <a href="../cathen/14319a.htm">Suarez</a> (De Religione, tr. iii, 1-3) does not seem to think the division very <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a>, but accepts it as being in accord with the canons.
<h2>Personal sacrilege</h2>

<p>Personal sacrilege means to deal so irreverently with a sacred <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> that, whether by the injury inflicted or the defilement <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a>, there is a breach of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> due to such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. This sacrilege may be committed chiefly in three ways:

<ul> <li>by laying violent hands on a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> or religious. This constitutes an infraction of what is known as the privilege of the canon (<em>privilegium canonis</em>), and is visited with the penalty of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>; <li>by violating the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunity</a> in so far as it still exists. Clerics according to the old-time discipline were entitled to exemption from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of lay tribunals (<em>privilegium fori</em>). The meaning, therefore, is that he who despite this haled them before a civil court, otherwise than as provided by the canons, was guilty of sacrilege and was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>; <li>by any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> on the part of those who are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> &#151; such are those in <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacred orders</a> (in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>) and religious, even those with simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, if these are perpetual. The weight of opinion amongst <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moralists</a> is that this guilt is not contracted by the violation of a privately-made <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. The reason seems to be that, while there is a breach of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>, still such a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, lacking the indorsement and acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, does not make the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> formally a sacred one; it does not in the juridical sense set such an one apart for the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It need hardly be noted that the partners of sacred <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of this kind are to be adjudged equally guilty of sacrilege even though their status be a purely lay one.</ul>
<h2>Local sacrilege</h2>

<p>Local sacrilege is the violation of a sacred place. Under the designation "sacred place" is included not only a church properly so-called even though it be not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, but merely blessed, but also public <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> as well as cemeteries canonically established for the burial of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Four species of this crime are ordinarily distinguished:

<ul> <li>the theft of something found in and specially belonging to the church; <li>the infringing of the immunity attaching to sacred places in so far as this prerogative still prevails. It should be observed that in this case the term "sacred place" receives a wider comprehension than that indicated above. It comprises not only churches, public <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and cemeteries, but also the episcopal palace, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> erected by episcopal authority and having a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> for the celebration of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>, and also the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> when he is carrying the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. To all of these was granted the right of asylum the outraging of which was deemed a sacrilege; <li>the commission within the sacred precincts of some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act by which, according to canon law, the edifice is esteemed polluted. These acts are <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">homicide</a>, any shedding of blood reaching to the guilt of a grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, any consummated offence against chastity (including marital intercourse which is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>), the burial within the church or sacred place of an unbaptized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or of one who has been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by name or as a <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> violator of the privilege of the canon; <li>the doing of certain things (whether <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> or not), which, either by their own nature or by special provision of law, are particularly incompatible with the demeanour to be maintained in such a place. Such would be for instance turning the church into a stable or a market, using it as a banquet hall, or holding court there indiscriminately for the settlement of purely secular affairs.</ul>
<h2>Real sacrilege</h2>

<p>Real sacrilege is the irreverent treatment of sacred things as distinguished from places and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. This can happen first of all by the administration or reception of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> (or in the case of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> by celebration) in the state of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as also by advertently doing any of those things invalidly. Indeed deliberate and notable irreverence towards the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> is reputed the worst of all sacrileges. Likewise conscious maltreatment of sacred pictures or <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> or perversion of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> or <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> to unhallowed uses, and finally, the usurpation or diverting of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> (whether movable or immovable) intended for the maintenance of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> or serving for the ornamentation of the church to other uses, constitute real sacrileges. Sometimes the guilt of sacrilege may be incurred by omitting what is required for the proper administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> or celebration of the sacrifice, as for example, if one were to say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> without the <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">sacred vestments</a>.
