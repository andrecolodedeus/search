<h1>Sacristan</h1>  

<p>An officer who is charged with the care of the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>, the church, and their contents. In ancient times many <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the sacristan were performed by the doorkeepers (<em>ostiarii</em>), later by the <em>mansionarii</em> and the treasurers. The <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> (lib. I, tit. xxvi, "De officio sacrist&aelig; speak of the sacristan as if he had an honourable office attached to a certain <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, and say that his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> was to care for the <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a>, vestments, lights, etc. Nowadays the sacristan is elected or appointed. The "C&aelig;remoniale episcoporum" prescribed that in <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and collegiate churches the sacristan should be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and describes his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> in regard to the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>, the Blessed Eucharist, the <a href="../cathen/02274a.htm">baptismal font</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07421b.htm">holy oils</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">sacred relics</a>, the decoration of the church for the different seasons and feasts, the preparation of what is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the various ceremonies, the pregustation in <a href="../cathen/12232a.htm">pontifical Mass</a>, the ringing of the church bells, the preservation of order in the church, and the distribution of Masses; and finally it suggests that one or two canons be appointed each year to supervise the work of the sacristan and his assistants.

<p>The under-sacristan (<em>custos</em>) is also mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> (lib. I, tit. xxvii, "De officio custodis"). He was the assistant of the sacristan, was subject to the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, and discharged <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> very similar to those of the sacristan. Now the office is hardly ever attached to a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, but is usually a salaried position. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> desired that, according to the old canons, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> should hold such offices; but in most churches, on account of the difficulty or impossibility of obtaining <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> perform many of the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the sacristan and under-sacristan.
<h2>Altar societies</h2>

<p>There are altar <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> in connection with most <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches. The <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of members vary according to circumstances, in some instances including those which ordinarily fall within the sacristan's province, such as the vestments and altar vessels, making ready for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> Mass, and so on, but as a general thing they consist of the payment of yearly dues into a fund for the maintenance and repair of the accessories used in the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and usually also of a certain amount of labor for this purpose. Altar <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> differ from tabernacle <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> in that their work is for the benefit of the church to which they are attached. (See <a href="../cathen/14426a.htm">TABERNACLE SOCIETIES</a>).

<p>The Sodality of <a href="../cathen/08450a.htm">St. John Berchmans</a>, known as the Pious Association of Servers of Mass and Sacristans, was founded by Vincent Basile, S.J., missionary Apostolic among the southern <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, for lay <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a>, choir boys, sacristans, and all who have any <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to perform in the services of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Its object is to induce all its members to perform their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> piously and in a manner befitting the ceremonies in which they participate, for the glory of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the edification of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. The rules compiled by Father Basile bind the members to absolute silence in church, devout genuflexion when passing before the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, and the clear pronunciation of the words of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. This same circumspection is expected to characterize their conduct even in the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>, and they are required to attend monthly meeting and to receive <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> at least once a month. The director should be either the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> or a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> appointed by him. Although it is not a confraternity properly so-called, this sodality was approved by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a>, 21 Sept., 1865, and <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> were accorded to its members, subject to the usual conditions.
