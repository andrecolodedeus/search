<h1>Sadducees</h1>  

<p>A politico-religious <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> during the late post-Exile and New-Testament period. The old derivation of the name from <em>tsaddiqim</em>, i.e. the righteous; with assumed reference to the adherence of the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> to the letter of the Law as opposed to the pharasaic attention to the superadded "traditions of the elders", is now generally discredited mainly on philological grounds and the term is associated with the proper name "Sadoc", Sadducee being equivalent to Sadokite. They became the dominant <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> party during the Greek and Roman period of Jewish history, and the name, whether bestowed seriously or in irony, originated doubtless in their pretensions to the descendants of Sadoc, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> prominent in the times of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and Solomon (<a href="../bible/1ki001.htm#vrs8">1 Kings 1:8, 26, 32</a>; <a href="../bible/1ki002.htm#vrs35">2:35</a>; <a href="../bible/1ch029.htm#vrs22">1 Chronicles 29:22</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/eze040.htm#vrs46">Ezekiel 40:46</a>; <a href="../bible/eze042.htm#vrs19">42:19</a>; etc.). As a prominent political party they first appear in the reign of John Hyrcanus (135-105 B.C.). They espoused the hellenizing tendencies of the Asmonean princes in which they were strongly opposed by the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, or Separatists, a party evolved from the earlier <a href="../cathen/01800b.htm">Assideans</a>, and which abhorred all forms of Greek culture as detrimental to the religious interests of the Jewish nation. Under Aristobulus I and Alexander Jann&aelig;us, the immediate successor of John Hyrcanus, the power of the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> was supreme, and though the opposing faction of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> came into favour during the regency of Alexandra Salome (780-69 B.C.), the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> regained their ascendancy under Aristobulus II (69-63 B.C.) whom they supported in his conflicts with Hyrcanus II, Antipater, and the Romans. When Pompey captured <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (63 B.C.) he executed many of their leaders, as did also <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod the Idumean</a> on his accession to power (37 B.C.). The <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> retained however, their traditional <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions and also a varying preponderance in the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a>, but even in this respect their influence was much diminished through the policy of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> and later of the Roman procurators of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, who, arbitrarily and mainly for political reasons, appointed and removed the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priests</a> at will.

<p>During this period and down to the destruction of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> were naturally unpopular with the masses because of their marked tendency to side closely with the ruling power, while the patriotic and exclusive <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> became more and more the leaders of the people. Among the religious difference between the two parties may be mentioned the denial on the part of the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the existence of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#vrs23">Matthew 22:23</a>; <a href="../bible/mar012.htm#vrs18">Mark 12:18</a>; <a href="../bible/act023.htm#vrs8">Acts 23:8</a>). They rejected likewise the oral traditions which the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> maintained and emphasized as a Divinely <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> supplement to the written law. While the tenacity and exclusiveness and other characteristics of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> have been indelibly impressed on all subsequent generations of <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, the influence of the indifferent and materialistic <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> vanished completely as soon as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> ceased to be a nation.
