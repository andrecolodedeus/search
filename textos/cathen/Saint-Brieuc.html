<h1>Saint-Brieuc</h1>  

<p>(B<font size=-2>RIOCUM</font>)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a>; comprises the Department of the C&ocirc;tes du Nord. Re-established by the Concordat of 1802 as suffragan of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, later, in 1850, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Rennes</a>, the Diocese of Saint-Brieuc was made to include: (1) the ancient diocese of the same name; (2) the greater portion of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Tr&eacute;guier; (3) a part of the old Diocese of St. Malo, Dol, and Quimper, and the (4) <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the of the <a href="../cathen/15271b.htm">Diocese of Vannes</a>. In 1852 the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/13340a.htm">Saint-Brieuc</a> were authorized to add to their title that of the ancient See of Tr&eacute;guier.
<h2>(Ancient) diocese of Saint-Brieuc</h2>

<p>An <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, Briocus (Brieue), who died at the beginning of the sixth century founded in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Stephen a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which afterwards bore his name, and from which sprang the town of <a href="../cathen/13340a.htm">Saint-Brieuc</a>. An inscription later than the ninth century on his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, at Saint-Serge at <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a>, mentions him as the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Saint-Brieuc. According to Mgr. Duchesne certain trustworthy documents prove that it was King Nomenoe who, about the middle of the ninth century, made the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> the seat of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. Among the Bishops of Saint-Brieue, the following are mentioned: St. Guillaume Pinchon (1220-34), who protected the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the episcopate against Pierre Mauclerc, Duke of Brittany, and was forced to go into exile for some time at <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>; Jean du Tillet (1553-64), later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Meaux; and Denis de La Barde (1641-75)
<h2>Diocese of Tr&eacute;guier</h2>

<p>St. Tudgual, nephew of <a href="../cathen/02784a.htm">St. Brieuc</a>, was appointed by the latter at the close of the fifth century, superior of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Tr&eacute;guier, which he had founded. The biography of St. Tudgual, composed after the middle of the ninth century, relates that King Childebert had him <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tr&eacute;guier, but Mgr Ducheane holds that it was King Nomenoe who, in the middle of the ninth century, raised the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Tr&eacute;guier to the dignity of an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. The Diocese of Saint-Brieuc and Tr&eacute;guier pays special <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the following <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>: St. Jacut, first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Landouart (died about 440); St. Mandez, member of a princely <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> (sixth century); St. Briac, disciple of St. Tudgual; founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> around which the town of Boulbriac grew up (sixth century): St. Osmanna, an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> princess, who took refuge and died near Saint-Brieue (seventh century); <a href="../cathen/10068c.htm">St. Maurice</a> of Cornwall (1117-91), founder and first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Carnoet, in the <a href="../cathen/12611a.htm">Diocese of Quimper</a>; <a href="../cathen/08256b.htm">St. Yves</a> (1253-1303), born near Tr&eacute;guier, <a href="../cathen/08545a.htm">ecclesiastical judge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Diocese of Rennes</a>, then of the Diocese of Tr&eacute;guier, where he gained the name of "advocate of the poor". He was patron of the lawyers' confraternity, erected at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in the church of St. Yves des Bretons. His <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, destroyed during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, was re-erected in 1890 in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Tr&eacute;guier, whither it draws many <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. Numerous <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were held at Tr&eacute;guier in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and passed important regulations for the discipline of the Breton churches. Among the natives of the Diocese of Saint-Brieue are &mdash; Duclos (b. 1700 d. 1772), the historian of Louis XI (b. at Dinan); Ernest Renan (b. at Tr&eacute;guier, 1823; d. 1892). The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> historian Dom Lobineau died at the Abbey of St. Jacut, 1727. The town of La Roche Derrien, in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, was the scene of the great battle between Jean de Montford and Blessed Charles of <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a> (1346), after which the latter was taken as <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.

<p>The principal <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> in the Diocese of Saint-Brieuc are: Notre-Dame de Bon Secours at Guingamp the sanctuary of which was enriched by the munificence of the Dukes of Brittany; Notre Dame d'Esp&eacute;rance, at Saint-Brieuc, a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from 1848; Notre Dame de La Fontaine at Saint-Brieuc, dating from the establishment of an oratory by Saint-Brieuc, and revived in 1893 to encourage devotion to that Saint; Notre Dame de Guyaudet, near St-Nicholas du P&eacute;lem. Notre Dame de LaRonce, at Rostrenen, a sanctuary raised to the collegiate dignity by <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> in 1483.
