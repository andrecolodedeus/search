<h1>Saint-Claude</h1>  

<p>(S<font size=-2>ANCTI</font> C<font size=-2>LAUDII</font>).

<p>The Diocese of Saint-Claude comprised in the eighteenth century only twenty-six <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, subject previously to the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/13341a.htm">Saint-Claude</a>, and some <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> detached from the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a> and <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. By the Concordat of 1802, the territory of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was included in that of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>. Later the Concordat of 1817 re-erected the Diocese of Saint-Claude giving it as territory the Department of Jura, and making it suffragan to Lyons. The Abbey of <a href="../cathen/13341a.htm">Saint-Claude</a>, the cradle of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, was one of the most distinguished in the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a>. Between 425 and 430 the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> of <a href="../cathen/13163a.htm">Saints Romanus</a> and Saint Lupic withdrew into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> Condat, where Saint-Claude now stands, and there founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Condat: other <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were; attracted to them, the land was cleared, and three new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were founded: those of Lauconne, on the site of the present village of Saint Lupicin; La Balme, where Yole, the sister of Sts. Romanus and Lupicinus, assembled her <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>; and Romainmoutier, in the present Canton of Vaud. After the death of St. Romeanus (d. about 460), St. Lupicinus (d. about 480), St. Mimausus, St. Oyent (d. about 510), St Antidiolus, St. Olympus, St. Sapiens, St. Thalasius, St. Dagamond, St. Auderic, and St. Injuriosus were <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of Condat, which was distinguished also by the virtues of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, St. Sabinian, <a href="../cathen/11424a.htm">St. Palladius</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15254a.htm">St. Valentine</a> (fifth century), <a href="../cathen/08586a.htm">St. Justus</a>, St. Hymetierus, and St. Point (sixth century). The rule which was followed at the beginning in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Condat was drawn up between 510 and 515 and adopted by the great <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Agaune; later the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">rule of St. Benedict</a> was introduced at Condat. Flourishing <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> arose at once around Condat and from them came <a href="../cathen/13163a.htm">St.Romanus</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, and St. Viventiolus, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. In the early years of the sixth century the peasants who gathered around the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Condat created the town which was to be known later by the name of <a href="../cathen/13341a.htm">Saint-Claude</a>.

<p>The Life of St. Claudius, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Condat, has been the subject of much controversy. Dom Benott says that he lived in the seventh century; that he had been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a> before being <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, that he was fifty-five years an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and died in 694. He left Condat in a very flourishing state to his successors, among whom were a certain number of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>: St. Rusticus, St. Aufredus, St. Hipplytus (d. after 776), St Vulfredus, St. Bertrand, St. Ribert, all belonging to the eighth century. Carloman, uncle of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, went to Condat to become a religious; St Martin, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Condat was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> probably in the time of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. this Emperor was a benefactor of the Abbey of Condat; but the two diplomas of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, formerly in possession of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/13341a.htm">Saint-Claude</a>, and now preserved in the Jura archives, dealing with the temporal interests of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, have been found by M. Poupardin to be forgeries, fabricated without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> in the eleventh century. A <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Condat, Venerable Manon, after having enriched the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> with precious <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> was, about 874, appointed by Charles the Bald, head of the Palace <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> where he had among his pupils, St. Radbod, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>. Two <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of Condat, St. Remy (d. 875) and St. Aurelian (d. 895), filled the archiepiscopal See of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. In the eleventh century the renown of Abbey of Condat was increased by St. Stephen of Beze (d. 1116) by St. Simon of Crepy (b. about 1048), a descendant of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>; this saint was brought up by Mathilda, wife of William the Conqueror, was made Count of Valois and Vexin, fought against Philip I, King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and then became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Condat. He afterwards founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Monthe, went to the court of William the Conqueror to bring about reconciliation with his son, Robert, and died in 1080.

<p>The body of St. Claudius, which had been concealed at the time of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> invasions, was discovered in 1160, visited in 1172 by St. Peter of <a href="../cathen/14454a.htm">Tarentaise</a>, and solemnly carried all through <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> before being brought back to Condat. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and the town, theretofore known as Oyent, were thenceforeward called by the name of <a href="../cathen/13341a.htm">Saint-Claude</a>. Among those who made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Saint-Claude were Philip the bold, Duke of burgundy, in 1369, 1376, and 1382, Philip the Good in 1422, 1442, and 1443, Charles the Rash in 1461, Louis XI in 1456 and 1482, blessed Amadeus IX, Duke of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, in 1471. In 1500 Anne of Brittany, wife of Louis XII, went there in thanksgiving for the birth of her daughter Claudia. The territory of <a href="../cathen/13341a.htm">Saint-Claude</a> forme a veritable state; it was a member of the Holy Empire, but it was not a fief, and was independent of the Countship of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. In 1291, Rudolph of Hapsburg named the dauphin, Humbert de Viennois, his vicar, and entrusted him with the defense of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/13341a.htm">Saint-Claude</a>. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/13341a.htm">Saint-Claude</a> became a kind of Chapter, to enter which it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to give <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of four degrees of nobility The system of &quot;commendam&quot; <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> injurious to the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. Among the commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of <a href="../cathen/13341a.htm">Saint-Claude</a> were Pierre de la Baume (1510-44) during whose administration Geneva fell away from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; Don Juan of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, natural son of Philip IV (1645-79), and Cardinal d'Estr&eacute;es (1681-1714). The Abbey of <a href="../cathen/13341a.htm">Saint-Claude</a> and the lands depending on it became French territory in 1674, on the conquest of La Franche-Comt&eacute;. At that the inhabitants of La Franche-Comt&eacute; took him as their second regional patron, and associated him everywhere with St. Andrew, the first patron of the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundians</a>. <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> prepared and <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> published a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> on 22 January, 1742, decreeing the secularization of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and the erection of the episcopal See of <a href="../cathen/13341a.htm">Saint-Claude</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who bore the title of count, inherited all the seignorial <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. Moreover the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the canons continued to hold the dependents of the old <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> as subject to the <a href="../cathen/10579a.htm">mortmain</a>, which meant that these men were incapable of disposing of their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. The lawyer, Christian, in 1770, waged a very vigorous campaign in favour of six communes that protested against the <a href="../cathen/10579a.htm">mortmain</a>, and disputed the claims of the canons of <a href="../cathen/13341a.htm">Saint-Claude</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of their lands. Voltaire intervened to help the communes. The Parliament of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>, in 1775, confirmed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the Chapter; but the agitation excited by the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> apropos of those subject to the <a href="../cathen/10579a.htm">mortmain</a> of <a href="../cathen/13341a.htm">Saint-Claude</a>, was one of the signs of the approaching <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. In March, 1794, the body of St. Claudius was burnt by order of the revolutionary authorities.

<p>Dole, where <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a> constructed in the twelfth century an immense castle in which he sojourned from time to time, but which has now disappeared, and where Philip the Good, Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, established in 1422 a parliament and a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> &#151; transferred in 1691 to <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a> by <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> &#151; deserves mention in <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">religious history</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> opened at Dole, in the sixteenth century, a celebrated establishment known as the Coll&egrave;ge de l'Arc, the most important in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> after the Coll&egrave;ge de la Fl&egrave;che. Anne de Sainctonge (1567-1621) founded there an important branch of the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, which left its mark in the history of primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The celebrated chemist, <a href="../cathen/11536a.htm">Pasteur</a> (1822-95), was a native of Dole. Among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> connected with the history of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: St. Anatolius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01135f.htm">Adana</a>, in Cilicia, who died a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> near Salins in the diocese (fifth century); St. Lautenus (477-547), founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> bearing his name; St. Bernond, who established the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> abbey of Gigny and rebuilt in 926 the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> abbey of Baume-les-Moines (ninth-tenth century); <a href="../cathen/04099b.htm">St. Colette of Corbie</a> (1381-1447), foundress of the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clare</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Poligny in which town her <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are preserved; her friend Blessed Louise of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> (1462-1503), niece of Louis XI, King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and daughter of Blessed Amadeus IX of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, wife of Hugue de Chalon, Lord of Nozeroy, then a <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clare</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Orbe founded by <a href="../cathen/04099b.htm">St. Colette</a>; her <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were transferred to Nozeroy, and afterwards to <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>; Blessed John of Ghent, surnamed the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> of <a href="../cathen/13341a.htm">Saint-Claude</a>, celebrated in the fifteenth century for his prophecies in 1421 and 1422 to Charles VII and Henry V, King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, relative to the deliverance of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the birth of a dauphin; <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a>; Ste Jane de Chantal, whose important interview at Saint-Claude in 1604 determined the foundation of the Visitation order; Venerable Frances Monet, in religion Fran&ccedil;oise de Saint-Joseph (1589-1669); <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> worker, born at Bonas in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; Blessed Pierre Fran&ccedil;ois N&eacute;ron, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, a native of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (nineteenth century).

<p>The principal <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> in the Diocese of Saint-Claude are: the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of St-Pierre at Baume-les-Moines, where numerous <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are preserved; Notre-Dame-de-Mont-Roland, end of the eleventh century; Notre-Dame-Miraculeuse, at Bletterans, 1490; Notre-Dame-de-la-Balme at Epy, sixteenth century; Notre-Dame-Lib&eacute;ratrice, at Salins, 1639; Notre-Dame-de-Mi&egrave;ges, 1699; Notre-Dame-de-l'Ermitage, at Arbois, seventeenth century; Notre-Dame-du-Ch&ecirc;ne, at Cousance, 1774. Before the application of the Law of 1901 against the congregations there were in the Diocese of Saint-Claude, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and various teaching orders of brothers; the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a> still remain there. Among the congregations of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> which were first founded in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: the Soeurs du Saint-Esprit, teachers and hospitallers, with their mother-house at Poligny, and the Sisters of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis of the Immaculate Conception, teachers and hospitallers, with their mother-house at Lons-le-Saunier.
