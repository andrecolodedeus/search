<h1>Saint-Denis</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> erected in 1850 as suffragan of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, includes the Island of R&eacute;union in the Indian Ocean about 350 miles cast of <a href="../cathen/09509e.htm">Madagascar</a>. This island is 1000 sq. miles in area, and was discovered by the Portuguese, 8 February, 1513; it was originally called Sancta Appollonia, and later changed to Mascareigne from the name of their leader Mascarenhas. In 1638 a <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchman</a> named Gaubert hoisted the French flag there, and in 1642 Pronis, representing the Compagnie de Lorient, took possession of it in the name of the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In 1646 twelve Madagascar colonists who had revolted were transported there, and in 1649 Flacourt, Pronis's successor, changed the name from Mascareigne to Island of Bourbon; from 1654 to 1658 an attempt was made by Antoine* Thaureau, seven <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a>, and six <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> to colonize the west coast; in 1665 Regnault, who had been appointed governor of the island by the King, arrived with three ships bringing 20 labourers, a merchant, and 200 sick People, the first colonists of the island. The first apostles of R&eacute;union were P. Louis de Matos, a Portugese, who on his return journey from <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> built the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of Our Lady of the Angels (1667), and P. Jourdi&eacute;, a <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> father, who remained on the island from 1667 to 1670. In 1674 P. Bernardin, a <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a>, arrived from <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>; he drew up <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for hunting, planted cotton, taught the young girls to sew and spin, and was governor of the island from 1686 to 1689. In 1689 he went to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to lay the needs of the island before <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>. In 1703 Cardinal Maillard de Toumon, on his way to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, called at R&eacute;union and administered confirmation.

<p>In 1711 <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> entrusted the island to <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> missionaries, who began work there in 1714. In 1848 the island took the name of R&eacute;union, slavery was abolished, and two years later the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was established. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Julien Desprez (1850-57), afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. In March, 1851, he set out in the corvette "Cassini". The captain in charge, Fran&ccedil;ois de Plas, the ensign Jaussier, and the lieutenant Alexis Clerc, afterwards became <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; Clerc died a <a href="../cathen/04168a.htm">victim of the Paris Commune</a>. Gaul&eacute;jac, a midshipman on the same vessel, in after life became a <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a>. The R&eacute;union <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are trained in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> at the Seminary of the <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Fathers of the Holy Ghost</a> and Sacred Heart of Mary which serves as <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. In 1905 (at the breach of the Concordat) the island contained one <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> served by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Fathers; the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of Cluny, a nursing and teaching order, had 28 establishments there, and the Daughters of Mary, also a nursing and teaching order, conducted 10 establishments; the population was 173,000; there were 54 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and 74 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.
