<h1>Saint-Di&eacute;</h1>  

<p>(SANCTI DEODATI)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> comprising the Department of the Vosges. Suppressed by the Concordat of 1802 and then included in the <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Diocese of Nancy</a>, it was re-established nominally by the Concordat of 1817, and in fact by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> of 6 October, 1822, and a royal ordinance of 13 January, 1823, as a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>. The Treaty of Frankfort (1871) cut eighteen communes from the Department of the Vosges, and added them to the <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Diocese of Strasburg</a>. The Diocese of St-Di&eacute; originated in the celebrated abbey of that name. St. Deodatus (Di&eacute;) (b. towards the close of the sixth century; d. 679) came from Le Nivernais, or, according to some authorities, from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; attracted by the reputation of St. Columbanus he withdrew to the Vosges, sojourning at Romont, and Arentelle, and made the acquaintance of <a href="../cathen/01686a.htm">St. Arbogast</a> and Florentius. For some time he was a solitary at Wibra, doubtless the present Katzenthal on Alsace, but being <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the inhabitants, he went to the Vosges and founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, which he named Galil&eacute;e on lands (called "Juncturae") given to him by Childeric II. The town of St-Di&eacute; now stands on this site. At the same time, Leudin Bodo, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Toul, founded to the north of Galil&eacute;e the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Bonmoutier and to the south that of Etival; Saint Gondelbert, perhaps after resigning the <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Archbishopric of Sens</a>, had just founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Senones to the east. These four <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> formed, by their geographical position the four extremities of a cross : Later, Saint Hidulphus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Treves (d 707), erected between them at the intersection. of the two arms of the cross, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Moyenmoutier. Villigod and Martin (disciples of St-Di&eacute;), Abbot Spinulus (Spin), John the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Benignus (disciples of St. Hidulphus) are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. in the tenth cent of the Abbey of St-Di&eacute; grew lax, a Frederick I, Duke of Lorraine, expelled the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, replacing them by the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> of St Augustine. <a href="../cathen/06790a.htm">Gregory V</a>, in 996, agreed to the change and decided that the <em>grand pre&eacute;v&ocirc;t</em>, the principal dignitary of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> should depend directly upon the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>During the sixteenth century, profiting by the long vacancy of the See of Toul, the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of the several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the Vosges, without actually declaring themselves independent of the Diocese of Toul, claimed to exercise a quasi-episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> as to the origin of which, however, they were not agreed; in the eighteenth century they pretended to be <em>nullius dioceseos</em>. In 1718, Thiard de Bissy <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Toul, requested the election of a see at St-Di&eacute; Leopold; Duke of Lorraine, was in favour of this step, but the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> opposed it; the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> refrained for the time from action. In 1777 a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> erected the abbey of St-Di&eacute; into an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>, and cut off from the Diocese of Toul (see <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">DIOCESE OF NANCY</a>) the new Diocese of St-Di&eacute;, which, until the end of the old r&eacute;gime, was a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. Louis Caverot, who died as <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St-Di&eacute; from 1849 to 1876.

<p>The Abbey of Remiremont was founded about 620 by Saint Romaric, a lord at the court of Clotaire II, who, having been converted by Saint Am&eacute;, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Luxeuil, took the habit at <a href="../cathen/09467a.htm">Luxeuil</a>; it comprised a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, among whose <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> were Sts. Am&eacute; (570-625), Romaric (580-653), and Adelphus (d. 670), and a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, which numbered among its abbesses Sts. Mactefelda (d. about 622), Claire (d. about 652), and G&eacute;b&eacute;trude (d. about 673). At a later period the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> were replaced by a chapter of ninety-eight canonesses who had to prove 200 years of nobility, and whose last <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>, under the old r&eacute;gime, was the Princess de Bourbon Cond&eacute;, sister of the Duke of Enghien; she was <a href="../cathen/12428a.htm">prioress</a> of the Monastery of the Temple at her death.

<p>Besides the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> mentioned above and some others, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a> and Toul, the, following are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in a special manner in the Diocese of St-Di&eacute;; St Sigisbert, King of Austrasia (630-56); St. Germain, a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> near Remiremont, a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, who died <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Grandval, near Basle (618-70); St. Hunna, a penitent at St-Di&eacute; (d. about 672); St. Dagobert, King of Austrasia, slain by his servant Grimoald (679) and honored as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>; St. Modesta, a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> at <a href="../cathen/12764b.htm">Remiremont</a>, afterwards foundress and <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Horren at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> (seventh century); St. Go&eacute;ry, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> (d. about 642), whose <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are preserved at Epinal and who is the patron of the butchers of the town; St. Simeon, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> (eighth century), whose <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are preserved at Senones; Sts. William and Achery, <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> near Ste. Marie aux Mines (ninth wife of Charles the Fat, who died as <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Andlau in Alsace; <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Blessed Joan of Arc</a>, b. at Domremy in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; Venerable M&eacute;re Alix le Clerc (b. at <a href="../cathen/12764b.htm">Remiremont</a>, 1576; d. 1622) and <a href="../cathen/11767b.htm">St. Peter Fourier</a> (b. at Mericourt, 1565; d. 1640), cur&eacute; of Mattaincourt, who founded the Order of Notre-Dame. Elizabeth de Ranfaing (b. at <a href="../cathen/12764b.htm">Remiremont</a>, 1592; d. 1649) founded in the Diocese of Toul the congregation of Our Lady of Refuge; Catherine de Bar (b. at St-Di&eacute;, 1614; d. 1698), known as M&eacute;re Mechtilde of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, at first an Annunciade <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> and then a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, founded at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in 1654, the Order of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of the Perpetual Adoration of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>; following in her footsteps Elizabeth Brem (1609-68) known as Mother Benedict of the Passion (1609-68), a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> at Rambervillers, established in that <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> the Institute of the Perpetual Adoration. The remains of Brother Joseph Formet, known as the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> of Ventron (1724-84), are the object of a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>. <a href="../cathen/10609a.htm">Venerable Jean Martin Moye</a> (1730-93), founder in Lorraine of the Congr&eacute;gation de la Providence for, the instruction of young girls and apostle of Su-Tchuen, was director for a brief period of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of St-Di&eacute;, and established at Essegney, in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, one of the first novitiates of the Soeurs de la Providence (hospitallers and teachers), whose, mother-house at Portieux ruled over a large number of houses before the Law of 1901. Grandclaude, a village teacher who was sent to the Roman College in 1857 by Bishop Caverot, contributed, when a professor in the <em>grand seminaire</em> of St-Di&eacute;, to the revival of canon law studies in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>It is interesting to note how at St-Di&eacute;, about the beginning of the sixteenth century, the newly discovered continent received the name of America. Vautrin Lud, Canon of St-Di&eacute; and <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> and secretary of Ren&eacute;e II, Duke of Lorraine, set up a printing-establishment at St-Di&eacute; in which two Alsatian geographers, Martin Waldseem&uuml;ller and, Mathias Ringmann, began at once to produce an edition of a Latin translation of Ptolemy's "geography". In 1507 Ren&eacute;e II received from <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> the abridged account, written in French, of the four voyages of <a href="../cathen/15384b.htm">Vespucci</a>. Lud had this translated into Latin by Basin de Sandaucourt. The printing of the translation was completed at St-Di&eacute; on 24 April, 1507; it was prefaced by a short writing entitled "<em>Cosmographiae introductio</em>", certainly the work of Waldseem&uuml;ler, and was dedicated to Emperor Maximilian. In this preface Waldseem&uuml;ller proposed the name of America. A second edition appeared at St-Di&eacute; in August, 1507, a third at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> in 1509, and thus the name a of America was spread about. The work was re-edited with an English version by Charles Herbermann (New York, 1907). M Gallois has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that in 1507 Waldseem&uuml;ller inserted this name in two maps, but that in 1513, in other maps Waldseem&uuml;ller, being better informed, inserted the name of <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> as the discoverer of America. But it was too late; the name of America had been already firmly established.

<p>The principal <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: Notre-Dame de St-Di&eacute;, at St-Di&eacute;, at the place where St. Di&eacute; erected his first sanctuary; Notre-Dame du Tr&eacute;sor, at <a href="../cathen/12764b.htm">Remiremont</a>; Notre-Dame de Consolation, at Epinal; Notre-Dame de la Brosse, at Bains; Notre-Dame de Bermont, near Domremy, the sanctuary at which <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Peter Fourrier at Mattaincourt. There were in the diocese before the application of the Law of 1901 against the congregations: Canons of Lateran; <a href="../cathen/04052a.htm">Clerks Regular of Our Saviour</a>; Eudistes; <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Fathers of the Holy Ghost</a> and the Holy Heart of Mary; various teaching orders of brothers. Among the congregations of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> founded in the diocese may be mentioned besides the Sisters of Providence, the Soeurs du Pauvre Enfant J&eacute;sus (also known as the Soeurs de la bienfaisance chr&eacute;tienne), teachers and hospitallers, founded in 1854 at Chemoy l'Orgueilleux; the mother-house was transferred to Remiremont. At the close of the nineteenth century the religious congregations in the diocese directed: 7 cr&eacute;ch&eacute;s; 55 day nurseries; 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> for boys and girls; 19 girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>; 13 workshops; 1 house of refuge; 4 houses for the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, 36 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or hospices; 11 houses of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> devoted to the care of the sick in their own homes; and 1 insane asylum. The Diocese of St-Di&eacute; had, in 1905 (at the time of the rupture of the Concordat), 421,104 inhabitants; 32 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; 354 succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; and 49 vicariates supported by the State.
