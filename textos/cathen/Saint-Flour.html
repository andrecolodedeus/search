<h1>Saint-Flour</h1>  

<p>(F<font size=-2>LOROPOLIS</font>)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> comprising the Department of Cantal, and is suffragan of the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>. Re-established by the Concordat of 1802, by which the Department of Haute-Loire was brought into this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, this department was detached from it in 1823 by the reestablishment of the <a href="../cathen/09185b.htm">See of Le Puy</a>. The traditions relative to St. Florus (Flour), who is said to have been the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lod&egrave;ve and to have died at Indiciat (later Saint-Flour) while evangelizing Haute-Auvergne, have been the subject of numerous discussions. In two documents concerning the foundation of the second <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St-Flour, drawn up in 1013 and 1031, and in a letter written to <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> in 1261 by Pierre de Saint-Haon, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of <a href="../cathen/13347b.htm">Saint-Flour</a>, St. Flour is already considered as belonging to the Apostolic times, and the "Speculum sanctorale" of Bernard Gui in 1329 relates at length the legend of this "disciple of Christ". M. Marcellin Boudet believes it more likely that St. Flour lived in the fifth century, and that it was he who attended the <a href="../cathen/01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a> in 450 or 451.

<p>At the close of the tenth century there was already a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Indiciat. A local <em>seigneur</em>, Astorg de Brezons, surnamed "the Red Bull", gave this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to Odilo, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny, and the donation was confirmed by <a href="../cathen/06790a.htm">Gregory V</a> (996-99). Amblard de Brezons, his nephew, surnamed "le Mal Hivern&eacute;", seized the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and destroyed all of it except the church. Amblard and Astorg, from 1010 to 1013, gave this church and its fief to St. Peter's at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, together with the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Sauxillages, governed by Odilo; but later Amblard considered this donation as void, and constructed a fortress, a remnant of which is now the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, upon the site of the old <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>; afterwards Amblard, seized with remorse at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, between 1025 and 1031 gave back to Odilo all he possessed, and a large <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was again founded. <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a>, after the Council of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> (1095), <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the church of this new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The church collapsed in 1396, and no remains of it exist. <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Pope Callistus II</a> passed some time there. In August, 1317, <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> detached Haute-Auvergne from the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> and raised St-Flour to the rank of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, the first ordinary of which was his <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> Raymond de Montu&eacute;jols. Among his successors were Pierre d'Estaing (1361-67), afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1370; Louis-Siffrein-Joseph de Salamon (1820-29), former <em>counseiller-clerc</em> to the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, who during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> had secretly acted in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> agent, a r&ocirc;le concerning which he has left very important memoirs.

<p>The Abbey of Aurillac was celebrated: it was founded by St. G&eacute;raud, Count of Aurillac, who in 898 brought thither <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from Vabres; it soon became well known, according to <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a>, as a centre of literacy and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> studies: Gerbert (later Sylvester II), and Guillaume d'Auvergne, friend and confidant of Saint Louis, studied there. St. Odo, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny, from 926 to 943, was at first a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at Saint-Pierre de Mauriae, and, according to some, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Aurillac. St. Peter Chavanon, founder in 1062 of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of P&eacute;brac, in the <a href="../cathen/09185b.htm">Diocese of Le Puy</a>, was for some time superior of the Abbey of Chazes, near Vic. The tragic poet de Belloy (1727-95), author of the celebrated tragedy on the Siege of Calais, was born at Saint-Flour. <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Louis-Antoine de Noailles</a> (1651-1729), <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, was born at Laroquebrou in the diocese. Abb&eacute; Jean Chappe d'Auteroche (1722-69), <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, who in 1769 went to <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> to observe the transit of Venus and died there of a contagious disease, was a native of Mauriae. Abb&eacute; de Pradt (1759-1837) was born at Allanche. The Diocese of Saint-Flour is remarkable among the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> for the great number of its sanctuaries and <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> dedicated to the Blessed Virgin. There are sixty-five, of which the following are the more important: Notre-Dame de Claviers, at Moussages, the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of which is the most ancient in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; Notre-Dame des Miracles, at Mauriac, sixth century; Notre-Dame de Frodi&egrave;re, at Saint-Flour, eleventh century; Notre-Dame de' Laurie, at Laurie, an eleventh-century sanctuary; Notre-Dame de Bon Secours at Marmanhac; Notre-Dame de Quezac, which is visited annually by between 20,000 and 30,000 <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>; Notre-Dam de Vau Claire, at Molompise &mdash; these three dating-back to the twelfth century; Notre-Dame de Valentines at S&eacute;gur, belong to the thirteenth century; Notre-Dame de Turlande at Paulhenc, Notre-Dame de Villedieu, both dating to the fourteenth century; Notre-Dame de Piti&eacute; at Chaudesaigues; Notre-Dame de Puy Rachat, at Nieudan; Notre-Dame des Oliviers, at Marat, all three dating back to the fifteenth century; Notre-Dame d'Aubespyre, at Aubespeyre; Notre-Dame dela font Sainte, at St. Hippolyte, visited annually by between 10,000 and 12,000 <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>; Notre-Dame de Pailherols; Notre Dame aux Neiges, at Aurillac, all four dating back to the sixteenth century; Notre-Dame de Gu&eacute;rison, at Enchanet; Notre-Dame de Lescure, both dating back to the eighteenth century.

<p>The "Revue catholique des &eacute;glises" published in 1905, an interesting monograph of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; it shows that 50 percent of the men go to Mass each Sunday, 25 per cent go every second <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a>, and 70 per cent fulfill their <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. An interesting work is the "&OElig;uvre des bergers", which assembles several hundred shepherds from the neighbouring regions each year at Pailherols and La Font Sainte for a day's religious exercises, the only one which they can have during the five months that they pass alone in the mountains. Before the application of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 1901 on the associations, there were in the Diocese of Saint-Flour <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> and various teaching orders of brothers. Some congregations of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> have their mother-houses in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, in particular: the Soeurs de Saint Joseph, with their mother-house at Saint-Flour; the Petites Soeurs des Malades, with their mother-house at Mauriac; the Soeurs de l'Enfant Jesus, dites de l'instruction; and the Soeurs de la Sainte Famille, with their mother-house at Aurillac. At the close of the nineteenth century the religious congregations directed in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, 1 cr&egrave;che, 12 refuge halls, 1 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the deaf and dumb, 1 boys' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>, 6 girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 1 home for honest poor girls, 1 hospice for incurables, 1 asylum for the insane, 1 dispensary, 1 house of retreat, I house of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> devoted to nursing the sick in their own homes, 13 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or hospices. At the time of the destruction of the concordat (1905) the Diocese of Saint-Flour contained 230,511 inhabitants, 24 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 288 succursal churches, and 190 vicariates towards the support of which the State contributed.
