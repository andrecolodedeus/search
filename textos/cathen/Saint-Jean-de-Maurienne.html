<h1>Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne</h1>  

<p>(DIOCESE OF MAURAMANENSIS)

<p>Includes the <em>arrondissement</em> of Saint Jean-de-Maurienne in the Department of Haute Savoie. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was suppressed by the Concordat of 1802, and its territory joined to the <a href="../cathen/03566c.htm">Diocese of Chamb&eacute;ry</a> under the French Empire, then in 1825 under <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> rule it was cut off from <a href="../cathen/03566c.htm">Chamb&eacute;ry</a> and made a special diocese, which with the rest of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> became French territory, 14 June, 1860. It is suffragan of <a href="../cathen/03566c.htm">Chamb&eacute;ry</a>. <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a>, in his "De Gloria Martyrum", relates how the church of Maurienne, belonging then to the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, became a place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, after the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> Thigris or Thecla, who was a native of Valloires, had brought to it from the East a finger of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>. Saint Gontran, King of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, took from the Lombards in 574 the valleys of Suse and Maurienne, and in 576 founded near the shrine a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, which was suffragan of Vienne. Its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Felmasius. In 599 <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> made futile attempts to make Queen Brunehaut listen to the protests of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> against this foundation. A letter written by <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a> in 878 formally designated the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maurienne as suffragan of <a href="../cathen/14454a.htm">Tarentaise</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> continued to claim Maurienne as a suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and under <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a> (1120) they carried their point. Local tradition claims as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Maurienne: St. Emilianus, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> (736 or 738); St. Odilard, slain by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> (916) together with St. Benedict, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Embrun. After the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> had been driven out, the temporal sovereignty of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maurienne appears to have been very extensive, but there is no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that such sovereignty had been recognized since Gontran's time. At the death of Rudolph III, Bishop Thibaut was powerful enough to join a league against Conrad II of Franconia. The emperor suppressed the See of Maurienne, and gave over its title and possessions to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> (1038); but this imperial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was never executed.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Maurienne were: St. Ayroldus (1132-46), once a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the Charterhouse of Portes; Louis de La Palud (1441-50), who as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a> had taken an active part at the Council of Basle in favour of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, <a href="../cathen/06031b.htm">Felix V</a>, who named him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maurienne in 1441; and afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; he was confirmed in both appointments by <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> in 1449; <a href="../cathen/08479a.htm">John of Segovia</a> (1451-72), who at the Council of Basle as representative of the King of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> had also worked for <a href="../cathen/06031b.htm">Felix V</a>, and was appointed by him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1441; ten years later <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> gave him the See of Maurienne; he is the author of "Gesta Concilii Basileensis"; William d'Estouteville (1473-80) was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1439 and as a pluralist held among other titles those of Maurienne and Rouen; Louis de Gorrevod (1499-1550) was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1530; Hippolyte d'Este (1560), made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1538, acted as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> to the Council of Poissy, and built the famous Villa d'Este at <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tivoli</a>; Charles Joseph Fillipa de Martiniana (1757-79), made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1778, was the first to whom <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a>, after the battle of Marengo, confided his intention of concluding a concordat with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; Alexis Billiet (1825-40), made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1861. Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, took solemn possession of a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Maurienne in 1564.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> specially <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in, or connected with, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: Saint Aper (Avre), a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who founded a refuge for <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> and the poor in the Village of St. Avre (seventh century); Blessed Thomas, b. at Maurienne, d. in 720, famous for rebuilding the <a href="../cathen/05785d.htm">Abbey of Farfa</a>, of which the third <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Lucerius, was also a native of Maurienne; St. Marinus, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Chandor, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> (eighth century); St. Landry, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Lanslevillard (eleventh century), drowned in the Arc during one of his apostolic journeys; St. B&eacute;n&eacute;zet, or Benoit de Pont (1165-84), b. at Hermillon in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and founder of the guild of <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">Fratres Pontifices</a> of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>; Blessed Cabert or Gabert, disciple of <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a>, who preached the Gospel for twenty years in the vicinity of Aiguebelle (thirteenth century). The chief shrines of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: Notre Dame de Charmaise, near Modane, Notre Dame de Bonne Nouvelle, near St-Jean-de-Maurienne, which dates from the sixteenth century, and Notre Dame de Beaurevers at Montaimon, dating from the seventeenth century. The <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, a nursing and teaching order, with mother-house at St-Jean-de-Maurienne, are a branch of the Congregation of St. Joseph at Puy. At the end of the nineteenth century, they were in charge of 8 day nurseries and 2 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. In Algeria, the East Indies, and the <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentine</a> they have houses controlled by the motherhouse at Maurienne. In 1905 (end of the Concordat), the Diocese of St-Jean-de-Maurienne had 61,466 inhabitants, 10 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 76 auxiliary <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and 28 curacies, remunerated by the State.
