<h1>Saint-Pierre and Miquelon</h1>  

<p>(INSULARUM S. PETRI ET MIQUELONENSIS).

<p>Prefecture apostolic comprising the only French possession in North America, a group of islands situated 48&#176;46' N. lat., and 58&#176;30 W. long. (Paris standard), having an area of 177 square miles. Geologically and geographically connected with Newfoundland, it was once likewise so historically. Known to the earliest Breton and Basque fishermen, this group already bore its present name when Jacques Cartier identified it in 1535, The first settlement dates from 1604. In 1689 Bishop St-Vallier visited it from Placentia, blessed a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and left a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in charge. The Recollects sent to Placentia (1691) attended this mission. The islands were successively ceded to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (Treaty of Utrecht, 1712), restored to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (Treaty of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1763), thrice captured by the English (1778, 1793, and 1808), and thrice retroceded to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (Treaties of <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a>, 1783, of <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, 1802, and of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, 1814). Many Acadians fled thither after the dispersion of Grand Pr&eacute; (1755) and the fall of Louisbourg (1757). The first missionaries who came after the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> were the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> Bonnecamp and Ardilliers, with dubious <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a> (1765). The islands now separated from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Quebec were erected by <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> into a <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefecture Apostolic</a>, and formed the first mission confided by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to the Seminary of the Holy Ghost. MM. Girard, prefect, and de Manach, who sailed the same year, were driven by a storm to Martinique. They were replaced (1766) by MM. Becquet and Paradis, likewise of the Holy Ghost Seminary, or Spiritains, as well as several of the following. In 1775 the prefect, M. Paradis, with his companion and 300 <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> were expelled by the English. M. de Longueville succeeded him in 1788. In 1792 M. Allain, vice-prefect, and his companion, M. Le Jamtel, were forced by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> to leave for the Magdalen Islands, with a number of <a href="../cathen/01090a.htm">Acadians</a> who, remaining faithful to the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, refused to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of the Constitution. The former inhabitants returning in 1816, M. Ollivier, who accompanied them, applied for <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec. He was appointed vice-prefect in 1820. His successors, with the same title, were MM. Charlot (1841), Le Helloco (1854), Le Tournoux (1864), Tiberi (1893); the two last named belonged to the newly-restored <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Congregation of the Holy Ghost</a>.

<p>The present titular is Mgr Christophe-Louis Legasse, b. at Bassussary, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 1859, appointed in 1898, <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> of His Holiness in 1899. His chief work was the erection of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St-Pierre, his residential town. The population, almost exclusively <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, varies from 4000 in winter to 8000 in summer, owing to the presence of the fishing crews. They are all Bretons, Normans, and Basques. Besides the six resident missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the fishermen, on the great banks are visited every month by a <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> on board a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> ship which also distributes their mail. There are 7 churches or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 4 stations, 6 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, those for boys managed until 1903 by 16 <a href="../cathen/03711c.htm">Brothers of Ploermel (Christian Instruction)</a>; 37 <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of Cluny (teaching and nursing) were subsidized by the Government until 1903. A classical college opened by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Fathers in 1873 was closed in 1892.
