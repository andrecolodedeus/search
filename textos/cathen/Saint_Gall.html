<h1>Saint Gall</h1>  

<p>(The Diocese of Saint Gall; S<font size=-2>ANGALLENSIS</font>)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> directly subject to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. It includes the Canton of St. Gall and, as a temporary arrangement, the two half-cantons of Appenzell Outer Rhodes and Appenzell Inner Rhodes. In 1910 its statistics were: 9 deaneries, each directed by a dean; 117 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; 116 additional cures of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; 128 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers; 233 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>; 46 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular priests</a>; about 169,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; and a non-Catholic population of 152,000. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is elected by the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter within three months after the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> falls vacant. According to the concordat of the Canton of St. Gall with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, he must be a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and must be approved by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> collegium of the cantonal great council. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of five resident and eight honorary canons, with a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> dean as its head. The resident canons have charge of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> services and the care of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, in which they are aided by 3 coadjutors and 3 vicars. Besides the chapter there is also a <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. For the training of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> there is a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at St. Gall which, however, is limited to the actual practical <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> course of a six months term. As a rule the students of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> attend for their academic training the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculties of the Universities of <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a> and Fribourg in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. The male orders are represented in the diocese only by 4 <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> orders in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: 1 house of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>; 2 of <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>; 2 of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>; 8 of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>; 1 of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd; 2 of the School <a href="../cathen/07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a>; 1 of <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>; 1 of the Italian-Missionary Sisters of St. Francis; and numerous houses of Sisters of Charity of the Holy Cross (Ingenbohl Sisters). The most noted church of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the church of the former <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> (see above). Among other of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> are: the Wildkirchlein, on the Santis; the little <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Notkersegg, near St. Gall; the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church at Kirchberg, in the District of Toggenburg; and Dreibrunnen, near Wil. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> associations are highly developed; a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> congress is held annually in the diocese. There are 12 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> newspapers, of which the "Ostschweiz", published at St. Gall, is the most important.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>The Abbots of St. Gall had exercised nearly all the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> within their territory. After the suppression of the ancient <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. there was evident need of a reorganization of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, which had sunk into a deplorable decay, and the plan was proposed to replace the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> by a Diocese of St. Gall. At that era a part of the present territory of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> belonged ecclesiastically to the <a href="../cathen/03743b.htm">Diocese of Chur</a>, and another part to the <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Diocese of Constance</a>. In 1815 the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> part of the <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Diocese of Constance</a> was separated from <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pope Pius VII</a>, and placed under the provisional administration of Provost Goldin of Berom&uuml;ster, in the Canton of Lucern. On the death of the <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> in 1819 this district fell to the <a href="../cathen/03743b.htm">Diocese of Chur</a>. The arrangement, however, was only intended to be a temporary one. After long negotiations the desired Diocese of St. Gall was established in 1823, but it was connected by personal union with the <a href="../cathen/03743b.htm">Diocese of Chur</a>. However, the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Gall that was raised to a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> received a separate <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter and an independent <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. The Bishop also was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to live alternately at <a href="../cathen/03743b.htm">Chur</a> and at St. Gall. This double diocese satisfied neither the inhabitants of the Grisons nor those of St. Gall. The former wanted their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for themselves, the latter feared that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03743b.htm">Chur</a> might regard St. Gall merely as an appendage of his old diocese and look down on it. Moreover, the government of the Canton of St. Gall meddled incessantly in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters and in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> right of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and demanded for itself the right of approval (<em>placetum regium</em>) in all more important discipline. When therefore the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Count von Buolschauenstein (1823-35), died, the governments of both cantons refused to recognize his successor, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> collegium of the great council of St. Gall appointed an episcopal administrator, Father Z&uuml;rcher, for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the canton. Finally <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, at the request of the Canton of St. Gall, suppressed the double diocese and erected in 1836 a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicariate Apostolic</a> of St. Gall; the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> was Johann-Peter Mirer of Upper Saxony, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Sargans.

<p>Negotiations concerning the erection of a separate Diocese of St. Gall were soon begun with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in order to bring this state of affairs to an end. It was, however, only after great difficulties that an agreement was made that was satisfactory both to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and to the Canton of St. Gall. In 1845 the Concordat was signed by the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> and the authorities of the canton; on 12 April, 1847, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> issued the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of circumscription, and on 29 June Mirer was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> as first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Gall. The new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> had soon a hard fight to wage with the Liberal party, which had gained ascendancy in the canton from 1855, as to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and liberties of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, a highly talented and very <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> man, was ably and vigorously supported in this struggle by <a href="../cathen/07025b.htm">Father Greith</a>, Gallus Baumgartner (father of the celebrated <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Alexander Baumgartner) the jurist Leonhard Gr&uuml;n (president of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> administrative council), and the advocate J.J. M&uuml;ller. Yet, notwithstanding all their efforts, they could not prevent the suppression of the newly-established <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> lyceum, the wasting of a part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> funds, or the combination of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cantonal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> town gymnasium to form a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in which both <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> were placed on a parity, to put an end to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> influence in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. These actions were the result of the terrorism of the Liberal Party (see on these events <a href="../cathen/07025b.htm">Greith</a>, "Die Lage der katholischen Kirche unter der Herrschaft des Staatskirchentums in Sankt Gallen", St. Gall, 1858). The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, however, maintained itself notwithstanding the storms, and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> developed and flourished greatly. A large part of the credit for this prosperity was due to <a href="../cathen/07025b.htm">Karl Johann Greith</a>, who was elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> after Mirer's death in 1862. Not long after his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> <a href="../cathen/07025b.htm">Greith</a> was also made provisional administrator of the Canton of Appenzell, which, after the dissolution of the <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Diocese of Constance</a>, had up to then been administered by Chur. This provisional administration has become in fact, although not legally, a permanent condition.

<p>After a few years of quiet new discords broke out in the diocese in connection with the <a href="../cathen/11235b.htm">Old-Catholic</a> movement in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07025b.htm">Greith</a> was accused of contravening the concordat and the constitutional <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. It did not, indeed, go as far as the deposition of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> demanded, but the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for boys, which <a href="../cathen/07025b.htm">Greith</a> had founded and maintained at a great sacrifice of money and time, was closed in 1874 by the government, and has not so far been reopened. Soon after this, <a href="../cathen/09691b.htm">civil marriage</a> was introduced by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Confederation, and the religious <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the young was endangered by the introduction of irreligious <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> books, and by forcibly putting both <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> on a parity in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. <a href="../cathen/07025b.htm">Greith</a> was succeeded by his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> Augustinus Egger (1882-1906). A widely-read author and a skilful orator, he deserves much credit for what he did to encourage <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life, not only in his own diocese but also in the whole of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. During his administration the extreme Radical government of the Canton of St. Gall was replaced by a moderate one, and the new constitution of 1890 has brought about a more satisfactory state of affairs between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. According to Article 24 of the constitution the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> alone have charge of religious and purely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> districts of the canton settle their own denominational organization subject to the approval of the great council, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> organization being in harmony with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Authorities chosen by each denomination have charge of denominational matters of a mixed nature as well as of the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>, of the state. Augustine Egger was succeeded in 1906 by the present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Ferdinand R&uuml;egg, b. 20 Oct., 1847, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 10 June, 1906.
