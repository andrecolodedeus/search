<h1>Saint Hyacinthe</h1>  

<p>(SANCTI HYACINTHI)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. In answer to a petition from the Fathers of First Council of Quebec to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, portions of the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> and Quebec were formed into a separate <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 8 June, 1852. At first the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was limited to the south side of the Richelieu River, and contained the greater portion of the Eastern Townships, a tract of land granted in the latter part of the eighteenth century to the American loyalists, but now a part of the Sherbrooke Diocese. Later three <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> on the north side of the Richelieu River were annexed. Today the diocese embraces the counties of Bagot, Iberville, Missisquoi, Richelieu, Rouville, Saint Hyacinthe, and a part of the counties of Brome (2 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>), and Verch&egrave;res, (3 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>).

<p>St. Hyacinthe, the titular city, is a typical <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> industrial town; it stands on the banks of the Yamaska, thirty-five miles from <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, and has a population of 10,000. Right Rev. J. C.  Prince, Coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Hyacinthe. Bishop Prince took possession on 3 November, 1852, and from the outset encountered great difficulties. The old <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> building was turned into a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and residence; unfortunately, it was burned in May, 1854. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> built a new residence as well as a chapel-cathedral. Bishop Prince showed untiring activity, founding twenty new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, establishing several missions, and in 1853 introducing from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the Sisters of the Presentation. He died on 5 May, 1860, at the age of fifty-six.

<p>By <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 22 June of the same year, Right Rev. Joseph La Rocque, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04581b.htm">Cydonia</a>, and Coadjutor of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, the second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was appointed. From November, 1856, to July, 1857, he had administered the diocese during the prolonged illness of Bishop Prince, but now, overwhelmed by the responsibility forced on him, and suffering from a series he petitioned the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to be relieved of this burden. His request was granted on 17 August, 1865. As <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06475b.htm">Germanicopolis</a> and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, he remained in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Sisters of the Precious Blood (a community which <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> him as its founder), until his death on 18 November, 1887, at the age of seventy-nine.

<p>The vacancy was filled on 20 March, 1866, by the Right Rev Charles La Rocque, cousin of the former <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who for twenty-two years was <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. John's. The new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was a highly-cultured man with rare financial ability; realizing that the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a> of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> called for unusual measures, he closed the episcopal palace and retired with his staff to Beloeil, where he combined the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of this <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> till his death on 25 July, 1875. Bishop La Rocque assisted at the Vatican founding the Sherbrooke Diocese. He opened the first house of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> by giving them a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> in his titular city, and had the satisfaction of effectively reducing the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> and placing the diocese on a satisfactory money basis.

<p>The fourth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Mgr. Louis-Z&eacute;phirin Moreau, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 16 January, 1876. He had come from <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> in 1852 as secretary to Bishop Prince. Bishop Moreau reopened the episcopal residence and on 4 July, 1886, dedicated the stone <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> which he had built with the money amassed by the economy of his predecessor. His <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter was installed in August, 1876, by the Most Rev. Dr. Conroy, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01699c.htm">Ardagh</a> and first Papal Delegate to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. On Bishop Moreau's invitation the Marist Brothers came from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and established their <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; he also founded a community to take charge of rural <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys and girls, under the name "Les Soeurs de St. Joseph". After seventeen years of administration he was given as coadjutor the Right Rev. Maxime Decelles (d. July 1905); the latter was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Druzipara on 9 March 1893, and entered on his administration of the Diocese of St. Hyacinthe immediately on the death of Bishop Moreau (24 May, 1901). During his administration he opened the patronage of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, and agitated the question of a new and larger <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The execution this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was left to his successor, who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Archbishop Bruchesi on 15 February, 1906. Bishop Bernard is now in his sixty-third year. From 1876, either as secretary, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, or <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar general</a>, he was constantly a member of the administration. In a series of ten volumes he has compiled and published with additional biographical notes the letters of the preceding <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of St. Hyacinthe to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and faithful of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Notwithstanding delicate health, since his elevation to the episcopate he has proved himself an indefatigable worker and an ardent apostle of temperance. He placed the patronage of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> on a stable basis, and, at the cost of $200,000, completely and beautifully restored and enlarged the old <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>.

<p>In the episcopal city of St. Hyacinthe are the following: College-Seminary (dating from 1811) with 400 students, all following a classical curriculum; the mother house of the Sisters of Charity (the <a href="../cathen/07031a.htm">Grey Nuns</a>) with 400 members who have charge of the Hotel Dieu; the mother house of the Sisters of the Presentation, with 600 members; the mother-house of Sisters of the Precious, Blood; the central <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fathers; the mother-house of the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>; the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Sisters of St. Martha, a community in charge of the domestic arrangements of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the Marist Brothers; the Institute of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>; a commercial college and an academy, both conducted by the <a href="../cathen/13305a.htm">Brothers of the Sacred Heart</a>.

<p>The Diocese of St. Hyacinthe has 74 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and a population of about 120,000, of whom 108,000 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> number 183 secular and 18 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities number 337 men and 861 <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: 2 superior teaching institutions, the Seminary of St. Hyacinthe and the Petit S&eacute;minaire de Sainte-Marie de Monnoir, both under the direction of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>; 6 commercial colleges; 56 academies; 435 primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Six <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and asylums provide for charitable wants.
