<h1>Saint Paul (Minnesota)</h1>  

<p>(SANCTI PAULI)

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> comprising the counties of Ramsey, Hennepin, Chisago, Anoka, Dakota, Scott, Wright, Rice, Lesueur, Carver, Nicollet, Sibley, Meeker, Redwood, Renville, Kandiyohi, Lyon, Lincoln, Yellow Medicine, Lac-Qui-Parle, Chippewa, Swift, Goodhue, Big Stone, and Brown, which stretch across the State of Minnesota from east to west, in about the center of its southern half.

<p>During the Seventh <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> (5-13 May, 1849) the fathers petitioned the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to erect a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in what was then the village of St. Paul. No action was taken on the matter in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for over a year, owing to revolutionary disturbances and the absence of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a> (1846-78) in <a href="../cathen/06333a.htm">Gaeta</a> consequent thereon. The See of St. Paul was actually established on 19 July, 1850. Its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> extended over an area of some 166,000 square miles, i.e. over what was then the Territory of Minnesota (established 3 March, 1849). The constituent parts were: a larger western part, to the west of the Mississippi, formerly part of the <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Diocese of Dubuque</a>, and a smaller eastern part, between the Mississippi and St. Croix rivers, formerly part of the <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Diocese of Milwaukee</a>. The size remained the same even after the admission of the <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">State of Minnesota</a> into the Union (11 May, 1858), and up to the erection of the Vicariate Apostolic of Northern Minnesota (12 Feb., 1875), of the Vicariate Apostolic of Dakota (12 Aug., 1879), and of the <a href="../cathen/15658b.htm">Diocese of Winona</a> (3 Oct., 1889), when it was reduced to its present area. At the time of its erection the Diocese of St Paul was assigned to the province of St. Louis, afterwards (12 Feb., 1875) to that of <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>. On 4 May, 1888, it became itself an archdiocese, and as such comprises at present the suffragan Sees of <a href="../cathen/05188c.htm">Duluth </a>, Crookston, St. Cloud, and Winona, in Minnesota; Fargo and Bismarck, in <a href="../cathen/11111b.htm">North Dakota</a>; <a href="../cathen/14016b.htm">Sioux Falls</a> and Lead, in <a href="../cathen/14160a.htm">South Dakota</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was named after the town of St. Paul, which had its origin late in the thirties of last century, along the left or eastern bank of the Mississippi, near the military post of Fort Snelling. Father Lucien Galtier had built a log <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> there, and had opened it for services on 1 Nov., 1841. The rude oratory was placed under the invocation of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, the Apostle of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and the name was then attached to the settlement itself.

<p>The earliest <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> record of what became afterwards the Diocese of St. Paul is in the Rune Stone, discovered in 1898 near Kensington, Minnesota. A strange inscription on it tells us of a visit made in 1362 by thirty Norsemen to the above locality, where ten of them were slain by the natives, and the remainder addressed a salutation to the Blessed Virgin Mary and called upon her for protection. Although not all the Scandinavian scholars are agreed on the authenticity of this text, still the internal evidence seems to be all in its favour; and nothing has been found so far to contradict its contents. Minnesota is a classic land in the history of early <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> voyageurs and missionaries. The first, as far as records go, were Groseilliers and Radisson, who spent some time on Prairie Island (1654-56) and in the neighbourhood of Knife lake, Kanabee County (1659-60). In 1679-80 <a href="../cathen/05188a.htm">Du Lhut</a> visited the countries around Lake Mille Lacs, the western extremity of Lake Superior, and the Mississippi. It was during these journeys that he met the Recollect <a href="../cathen/07215c.htm">Father Louis Hennepin</a> and his two companions Michel Accault and Antoine* Auguelle, and rescued them from their captivity among the <a href="../cathen/14017a.htm">Sioux Indians</a>. During an excursion down the Mississippi <a href="../cathen/07215c.htm">Hennepin</a> beheld and named the Falls of St. Anthony in what is now Minneapolis. Nicolas Perrot, in 1683, established a small trading post, Fort Perrot, near the site of the present town of Wabasha, Minnesota; and in 1689 he proclaimed the sovereignty of the French king over the regions of the upper Mississippi. In his company was the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> Joseph-Jean Marest, who spent considerable time among the <a href="../cathen/14017a.htm">Sioux</a> about the years 1689 and 1702. A contemporary of Perrot, Le Sueur, established in 1695 a trading on Prairie Island, and in 1700 another, Fort L'Huillier, on the Blue Earth River, about three miles from its junction with the Minnesota. In 1727 a post, Fort Beauharnois, was established on the western shore of Lake Pepin, near the present town of Frontenac, Minnesota; the missionaries stationed there were the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> Michel Guignas and Nicolas de Gonnor. Another, Fort St. Charles, was erected in 1732 on the southern shore of Northwest Angle Inlet, Lake of the Woods, by the explorer <a href="../cathen/09050b.htm">de Lav&eacute;rendrye</a>. The missionaries of the post were the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> Messaiger and Aulneau, the latter of whom met a cruel death at the hands of savage <a href="../cathen/14017a.htm">Sioux</a>. Religious ministrations were, of course, the chief object of the missionaries. Even the lay voyageurs did what they could towards the religious betterment of the natives. Groseilliers and Radisson instructed the older people in the elements of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> a number of children whom they believed in danger of death.

<p>No permanent settlements were made within the area of the Diocese of St. Paul until some time after the organization of the Government of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. In Sept., 1818, a mission was opened at Pembina, <a href="../cathen/11111b.htm">North Dakota</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlers, who had gone there from Lord Selkirk's colony near St. Boniface, Manitoba. The first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Father Dumoulin, and his immediate successors were sent from St. Boniface, the nearest <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. Within the years following upon 1826 many settlers of the Red River valley were compelled to depart, owing to floods, grasshoppers, and other afflictions; and a number of them, generally <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> and <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> French, came to the vicinity of what is now St. Paul. Bishop Loras of <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, accompanied by Father Pelamourgues, visited the few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in 1839; in 1840 he sent them a resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in Father Lucien Galtier, who in 1844 was replaced by Father Augustine Ravoux, for more than sixty years a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the Diocese of St. Paul. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Paul was Rt. Rev. Joseph Cretin (1851-57), <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Diocese of Dubuque</a>, appointed 23 July, 1850. His <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> took place at <a href="../cathen/02415a.htm">Belley</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 26 Jan., 1851; on 2 July of the same year, he took possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>; his death occurred on 22 Feb., 1857. The small log <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> built by Father Galtier was soon, replaced by a large structure of brick and stone, which contained accommodations for church, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and residential purposes. Another stone building was begun in 1855, but not finished until after the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> death; it is still used as the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. Paul. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, which consisted of several hundred, or perhaps a thousand, grew considerably in numbers, and counted about 50,000 at the end of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> career. The increase was largely due to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> own efforts, who invited <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlers to the fertile plains of <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>. In addition to the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> large contingents of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> arrived, who located in St. Paul, in places along the Mississippi, St. Croix, and Minnesota Rivers. Wherever it was possible <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> or missions were organized, and provided with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, or at least visited occasionally by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from other stations. At his arrival in St. Paul Bishop Cretin found only a couple of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> with small congregations at St. Paul, Mendota, and Pembina; at his death there were 29 churches and 35 stations with about 20 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> attending to the spiritual needs of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> people. Great efforts were made for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the young and for the preparation of worthy candidates for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. in Pembina there were the Sisters of the Propagation of the Faith. The <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of Carondelet came to St. Paul 3 Nov., 1851, and soon opened <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for both elementary and higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at St. Paul and St. Anthony Falls. In 1855 the Brothers of the Holy Family took charge of a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at St. Paul for boys in both the grammar and higher grades. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Fathers</a> from St. Vincent, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, sent some of their men to Minnesota in 1856, and soon a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was opened near St. Cloud in Stearns County. A <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was conducted in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> own house, where the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> training was imparted to young <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> of the sanctuary. Works of charity or of general benefit to <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> were not neglected. A <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> was founded at St. Paul by the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>; the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">St. Vincent de Paul Society</a> and other similar associations were organized; and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14482a.htm">temperance society</a> was established in 1852. Among the more noteworthy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> pioneers were <a href="../cathen/05787b.htm">Jean-Baptiste Faribeault</a>, Antoine* P&eacute;pin, Vital and Gervais Gu&eacute;rin, Joseph Turpin, Abraham Perret, Benjamin and Pierre Gervais, Joseph and his son Isaac Labissonni&eacute;re, Pierre and S&eacute;v&egrave;re Bottineau, August L. Larpenteur, Louis Robert, Charles Bazille, and William F. Forbes. Of the early <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, apart from Fathers Galtier and Ravoux, the following may be mentioned: Thomas Murray, Daniel J. Fisher, John McMahon, Francis de Vivaldi, Dennis Ledon, Marcellin Peyragrosse, George Keller, Claude Robert, Louis Caillet, Felix Tissot, Anatole Oster, Francis Pierz, Michael W&uuml;rzfeld, Demetrius Marogna, O.S.B., and Cornelius Wittman, O.S.B.



<p>After the death of Bishop Cretin the see of St. Paul remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> for over two years. Father Augustine Ravoux was appointed administrator; under his regime the present stone <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was completed and opened for service in 1858. The second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Paul was Rt. Rev. Thomas Langdon Grace, O.P. (1859-84). He was born, 16 Nov., 1814, at <a href="../cathen/03630a.htm">Charleston</a>, <a href="../cathen/14157a.htm">South Carolina</a>, entered the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> in 1829, and the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of St. Rose, <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, in 1830, where on 12 June, 1831, he made his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> as a member of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a>. In 1837 he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for further studies, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> there to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> by Cardinal Patrizi, 21 Dec., 1839. After his return to America in 1844 he was employed in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ministry first in <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, and afterwards for thirteen years at <a href="../cathen/10176a.htm">Memphis</a>, <a href="../cathen/14508a.htm">Tennessee</a>. In 1859 he. was called to the Bishopric of St. Paul by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>; his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> took place at St. Louis, 24 July, 1859; and on 29 July following he took possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, over which he presided until the day of his resignation, 31 July, 1884. He was then made <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Menith, and afterwards, 24 Sept., 1889, titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14031a.htm">Siunia</a>; his death occurred on 22 Feb., 1897.

<p>Several modifications were introduced in the territorial arrangement and the direction of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> during his incumbency. By the creation of the Vicariates of Northern Minnesota and Dakota the northern part of <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a> and the territory west of <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a> were erected into new <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> jurisdictions. In 1875 Bishop Grace received a coadjutor in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Rev. John Ireland, then <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The number of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> people in the diocese continued to grow, largely through the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> activity in inviting settlers; at the time of his resignation in 1884 it amounted to about 130,000. In addition to the races already represented there came also many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. The number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> grew with the increase of the people, and they were so chosen as to correspond to the needs of the flock; in 1884 they were 153 in all. Side by side with the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> there laboured fathers of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, and Oblates. Charitable institutions were kept up and multiplied wherever <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Hospitals were opened at Minneapolis and New Ulm, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> were erected at St. Paul and Minneapolis, and homes were established for the aged poor. The <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the children was promoted in all possible ways. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were founded and provided with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers; the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a> were called to St. Paul; and new academies for girls were opened. The growing needs in the field of charity and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> necessitated the coming of more religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the Congregations of St. Benedict, <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a>, St. Francis, Notre Dame, the Visitation the <a href="../cathen/07031a.htm">Grey Nuns</a>, the Good Shepherd, the <a href="../cathen/03711a.htm">Sisters of Christian Charity</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12254a.htm">Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a> furnished their quota. Like his predecessor, Bishop Grace never lost sight of the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of candidates for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. In 1860 he opened a preparatory <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for young boys who felt a vocation for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Among its pupils was Rt. Rev. John Shanley, late <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05786a.htm">Fargo</a>. Unfortunately, after some years of existence it had to be given up for lack of accommodations.

<p>To Bishop Grace succeeded his coadjutor, the Rt. Rev. John Ireland, D.D. (1884-). He was born at Burnchurch, Co. Kilkenny, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 11 Sept., 1838, and came to St. Paul with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> in 1852. Bishop Cretin sent him to Meximieux and Hyres, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where he completed his college and <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> course; he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> at St. Paul, 21 Dec., 1861. During the Civil War he served as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the Fifth Minnesota Regiment, and was afterwards stationed at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In 1875 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maxonea and coadjutor to Bishop Grace of St. Paul, in whose <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> he received the episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, 21 Dec., 1875. Upon the resignation of his predecessor he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Paul; and on 15 May, 1888, he was raised to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> dignity as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of St. Paul. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Province was organized with the suffragan Sees of <a href="../cathen/05188c.htm">Duluth </a>, St. Cloud, <a href="../cathen/15658b.htm">Winona</a>, Jamestown (Fargo), and <a href="../cathen/14016b.htm">Sioux Falls</a>, to which were added afterwards those of <a href="../cathen/09098a.htm">Lead</a> (1902), Crookston, and Bismarck (1910). The creation of the <a href="../cathen/15658b.htm">Diocese of Winona</a> diminished the territory of the archdiocese by the southern section of <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>. In 1910 an <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> was appointed in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Rt. Rev. John J. Lawler, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Greater Hermopolis. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population kept steadily on the increase, so that at present it numbers about 260,000. Much of this growth is due to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> own efforts. From the day of his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> he organized a systematic movement for the colonization of different parts of <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>. Various settlements such as De Graff, Clontarf (Swift Co.), Adrian (Nobles Co.), Avoka, <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> (Murry Co.), Graceville (Big Stone Co.), Minneota, and Ghent (Lyon Co.), owe their origin and prosperity to his labours. With the increase of the people grew also the number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, which at present exceeds 300. Of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, one, that of the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marist Fathers</a>, was added to the existing ones. The <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> were maintained and increased. The work of temperance found always a most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> advocate in the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> received from him a liberal and wise patronage. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> grammar and high schools were multiplied and rendered more efficient. A new departure in the higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> was made by the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> in the opening of St. Catharine's College in 1905. To the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities engaged in teaching was added another, that of the <a href="../cathen/06027b.htm">Felician Sisters</a>.

<p>The training of the candidates for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is imparted in two institutions. On 8 Sept., 1885, the Seminary of St. Thomas opened its gates to students of both the college and <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> curriculum, with an attendance of 27 in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and philosophy, and of 39 in the classics. St. Thomas continued to house the two departments until in 1894, when it was continued as a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>; and its growth has been so marvellous, that during the past year it enrolled nearly 700 students. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was transferred, in Sept., 1894, to new quarters, the St. Paul Seminary, built and endowed by the munificence of St. Paul's great citizen, James J. Hill. In the year of its opening it numbered about 60 students, and last, year it had on its list 165 seminarians, representing 19 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. In 1905 the St. Paul <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Historical Society was organized with headquarters in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. The following events illustrate the growth of the Diocese and the Province of St. Paul within recent years. On 2 June, 1907, the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> was laid for the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. Paul; and a year afterwards, 31 May, 1908, a similar <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> was performed with reference to the new pro-cathedral of Minneapolis. The <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Seminary of St. Paul witnessed, 19 May 1910, a scene extremely rare, if not unique, in the annals of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>. Six <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> received on that day their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, all six destined for service in the one Province of St. Paul. The present condition of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> may best be gauged from the following statistics: <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, 1; <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 1; <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 275; <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, 40; churches with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 188; missions with churches, 62; <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 17; <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, 1; college, 1; commercial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>, 2; number of pupils in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 21,492; boarding-schools and academies for girls, 7; <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>, 3; <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 3; homes for the aged poor, 2; house of the Good Shepherd, 1.
