<h1>Saint Petersburg</h1>  

<p>Saint Petersburg, the imperial residence and second capital of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, lies at the mouth of the Neva on the Gulf of Finland. In 1899, including the suburbs, it had 1,439,600 inhabitants; of these 81.8 per cent belonged to the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, 4.8 per cent were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 7.03 per cent were <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and 1.4 per cent were <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. As regards nationality 87.5 per cent were Russians, 3.3 per cent were German, 3.1 per cent were Poles, 1.03 per cent were Finns, and 1.03 per cent were Esthonians. In 1910 the population was estimated at over 1,900,000 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. The district of Ingermannland, that is, the territory between Lake Peipus, the Narova River, and Lake Ladoga, in which St. Petersburg is situated, belonged in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> to the Grand Duchy of Novgorod, and later to <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>. In 1617 the district was given by the Treaty of Stolbovo to Sweden; in 1702 it was rewon by Peter the Great. When Peter in 1703 formed the daring plan to transfer the centre of his empire from the inaccessible <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> to the Baltic and to open the hitherto isolated <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> to the influence and cultivation of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> by means of a large fortified commercial port, he chose for his new creation the southern end of the present island of Petersburgsky. At this point the Neva separates into two branches, the big and the little Neva; here on 16 (27) May, 1703, he began the citadel of Peter and Paul, the fortifications of which were built first of wood and in 1706 of stone. The Troitzki church was the first wooden church of the imperial city; around it were erected houses in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> style for Peter and his friends. As early as 1704 the first habitations were built on the northern bank of the Neva. Some 40,000 men drawn from all parts of the empire worked for several years in the erection of the new city; a large number of them succumbed to the extreme severity of their labours and the deadly mists of the marshy ground. In 1708 St. Petersburg was unsuccessfully besieged by the Swedes. The Russian victory over Charles XII at Pultowa put an end to any danger that might have arisen from <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>. In 1712 the city was formally made the residence of the Court.

<p>It was Peter's desire that his new capital should not be surpassed in brilliance by the capitals of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. He intended to follow in its construction the plans of the architect and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> Andreas Schl&uuml;ter, who was called to St. Petersburg in 1713 but died in the following year. In order to make the new capital the equal of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> in religious matters, Peter and his successors built a large number of churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, often equipped with the most lavish splendour. Peter sought, above all, to establish veneration for the national saint, Alexander Newski, Grand duke of Novgorod, who died in 1261. He therefore built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> near Neva, on the spot where Alexander in 1241 gained the traditionally celebrated victory over the united forces of the Swedes, <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danes</a>, and Finns; this victory cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> historically. The bones of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> were placed in the church with much pomp in 1724. The tsar himself drew up a plan for a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and gave to its construction 10,000 roubles from his private fortune, besides state revenues. At Peter's death the city had 75,000 inhabitants. However, a pause now occurred in its development as Catherine I and Peter II preferred the old capital <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>. Anna Ivanovna (1730-40) was the first ruler to live again at St. Petersburg. During her reign and that of her successor, Elizabeth Petrovna, the city grew greatly and was adorned with striking buildings. Most of the older public buildings, however, belong to the reigns of Catherine II and Paul I, who were great builders. By the favour of the tsars who competed with one another in adorning it with <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and collections, as well as by its advantageous position for commerce and intercourse with Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, St. Petersburg has gradually surpassed its rival <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>. It has developed into the largest city of the empire, but has assumed more the character of a city of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> than that of a national Russian one.

<p>The history of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at St. Petersburg goes back to the era of the founding of the city. As early as 1703 there were a few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the city. In 1704 one of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who since 1684 had been able to maintain themselves at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, came to St. Petersburg in order to make the observance of their religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> easier to the officers and soldiers stationed on the Neva; he had also the spiritual care of over 300 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Lithuanians who had been taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>. From 1710 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had a little wooden <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, called the Chapel of St. Catherine, not far from the spot where the monument to Peter the Great now stands. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> register of the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> goes back to this year. Later, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> took the place of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Although Peter the Great was kindly disposed to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> community, the Holy Synod, an administrative <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> board that he had created, was constantly suspicious of them. National disputes having arisen between the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, the Holy Synod was able to obtain an imperial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> in 1725, compelling all the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> but one to leave the city. This one remained behind in the employ of the French embassy and was permitted to hold services for his countrymen in a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> designated for the purpose. In 1737 the wooden church burnt down. It was decided to rebuild it in stone and a temporary <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was arranged. Although the Empress Anna Ivanovna gave a piece of ground, the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of the new Church of St. Catherine was not laid until 1763 on account of the national feuds within the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> community of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, French, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, and Poles. The construction of the church advanced slowly because of lack of funds. It was built in the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> style by the Italian architect, Vollini de la Mothe, and was formally <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> Archetti in 1783. In 1769 Catherine II confirmed the gifts of her predecessors and released the church, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and dwelling of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from all taxes and imposts. In the same year she issued the "Ordinatio ecclesi&aelig; petropolitan&aelig;", which settled the legal status of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and was a model for the other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. This ordinance raised the permitted number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from four to six. These were generally <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, who had charge of the welfare of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> at Kronstadt, Jamburg, Riga, and Reval.

<p>The number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was considerably increased by the French emigrants whom the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> caused to flee to St. Petersburg. Further, the fact that the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the newly founded <a href="../cathen/10428a.htm">Archdiocese of Mohileff</a> soon transferred his residence to the capital of the empire also contributed to the strengthening of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in St. Petersburg. In October, 1800, the Church of St. Catherine was confided to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at the request of the Emperor Paul. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> opened a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> that was soon very prosperous, but their success and the many following conversions aroused the jealousy of the Orthodox. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were expelled from St. Petersburg on 22 December, 1815, and from the whole of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> in 1820. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> care of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of St. Petersburg was given to <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, and in 1816 to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> who have been in the city continuously until the present time. A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Rumanian church was built during the reign of Alexander I. During the forties the number of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> increased to twenty; but the closing of the Polish <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, from which they drew new members, reduced their number, and it became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to call fathers from <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Since 1888 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> have also been admitted to the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a>; still the present number of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> is hardly sufficient to meet the needs of the entire <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> community, the pastoral care, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and charitable demands. In addition, there still remains the old limitation of administration by the governmental church consistory, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> collegium, and the department of the state ministry for foreign <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, which exerts a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> care that an active <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life, religious freedom, and efforts for the conversion of those of other faiths should be and remain impossible.

<p>Ecclesiastically, as regards <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, St. Petersburg is the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/10428a.htm">Mohileff</a>, of the general consistory, of the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> collegium (the highest collegiate church board of administration, which, however, has to obtain the consent of the minister of the interior in all more important matters), of a <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> preparatory academy for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and of an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. The Cathedral of the Assumption of Mary was built in the Byzantine style in 1873 and was enlarged 1896- 1902. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> Church of St. Catherine was erected in 1763, that of St. Stanislaus in 1825, that of Our Lady in 1867, that of St. Casimir in 1908, and the German <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> Church of St. Boniface in 1910. In addition there are 4 public and 10 private <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> in the city. The <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> is under the care of 6 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and administrators, and 15 vicars and <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>; there are also 2 military <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> soldiers. The orders settled in the city are the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/02104a.htm">Assumptionists</a>, Oblates, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>. Besides the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> there is a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> gymnasium for boys and one for girls, and a higher <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religious instruction is given in 30 public intermediate <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys, 11 military <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and 28 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls. According to the year-book of the <a href="../cathen/10428a.htm">Archdiocese of Mohileff</a> the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> is 87,500.
