<h1>Saint Thomas of Mylapur</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF SAINT THOMAS OF MYLAPUR (SANCTI THOMAE DE MELIAPOR).

<p>Suffragan to the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> See of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> in the East Indies; it, derives its name from the site of its <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in which the Apostle, St. Thomas was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> on his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> and the Tamil word <em>Mailapur</em> (i.e. the town of peacocks), which the Greeks rendered as Maliarpha the Portuguese Meliapor, and the English Mylapore.
<h2>Early history</h2>

<p>The local Indian tradition, largely corroborated by collateral evidence is that the Apostle St. Thomas, after preaching on the west coast of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, passed on to the east coast and fixed his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> at Mylapur, which was then a flourishing city. The number of converts, be made having aroused the hostility of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, he fled from their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> to the summit of what is now known as St. Thomas's Mount situated in a direct line four miles to the southwest, of Mylapur. Thither he was followed by his <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a>, who transfixed him with a lance as he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> kneeling on a stone, A.D. 68. From the facts that the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> declares St. Thomas to have &quot;crowned the glory of his <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostleship</a> with <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at Calamina&quot; and that no traces of any Calamina exist, various theories &#151; some of them probably absurd &#151; have been put forward to identify Calamina with Mylapur, or with St. Thomas's Mount. The writer of this article once suggested that Calamina might be a modification of Cholamandalam (i.e. the kingdom of the Cholas as the surrounding country was in the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> era). On maturer reflection he has found it far more reasonable to believe that Calamina was an ancient town at the foot of the hill at St. Thomas's Mount, that has wholly disappeared, as many more recent, historic Indian cities have disappeared, built as they were of mud, except for their <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> arid palaces which were of exquisitely wrought stone. This much is certain: till <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> settled in the place there was no Indian name even for the hill. This is shown by the present, Indian name, Faranghi Malai (i.e. hill of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>), used to denote both the bill and the town around its base, a service which the English name &#151; St. Thomas's Mount equally renders. His body was brought to Mylapur and buried in the house in which he had lived, and which was used as a place of worship. A notable portion of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the Apostle was obtained for the church of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, at an early period, by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> traders from <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. The Edessene <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were in course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> conveyed to <a href="../cathen/03689b.htm">Chios</a>, and finally to Ortona in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, where they are yet <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>.

<p>India's maritime trade languished and died out about the fourth century. Though the country was thus cut off from all communication with the external world, the succession of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was kept up till the revival of <a href="../cathen/02730a.htm">Brahminism</a> at Mylapur in the seventh century, when there was a ruthless massacre of <a href="../cathen/08269b.htm">Jains</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mylapur and his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, and the remnant of his flock fled across the country to the mountains of the west. As the sees on the west coast were vacant at the time, the <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">Apostolic succession</a> was interrupted, and on the death of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> then living, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> kept the light of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> burning by lay <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the recitation of their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, by wearing a cross, and by surreptitious visits to the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the Apostle in the ruined church at Mylapur; in this they were helped by the fact that shortly after the massacre, Mylapur had been overwhelmed by the sea, which returned to its bed after wrecking the city and causing the Brahmins to flee and build a new Mylapur a mile further inland. This new Mylapur is to this very day almost purely Brahmin. The site of old Mylapur is now a sand dune, and would have been wholly forgotten but for the interest it possessed for the early Indian <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and their successors.
<h2>Nestorian period</h2>

<p>India's maritime trade began to revive in the ninth century. The <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> merchants from <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, finding that there were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, brought out their own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and subsequently <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to minister to them, whom the Indian <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> for want of instruction did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Presently, a new <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> town began to rise on the sand dune that covered old Mylapur, the most prominent feature of which was a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> over the site of the Apostle's <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. Hence the Persian and Arabian traders called the town Betumah (i.e. house, church, or town of Thomas. But the Indian <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> called it Tirumailapur (i.e. Holy Mylapur). It is this <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> that the ambassadors of <a href="../cathen/01309d.htm">Alfred the Great of England</a> are supposed to have visited (A.D. 883), and which John of Monte Corvino (1200), <a href="../cathen/12217a.htm">Marco Polo</a> (1220), Blessed Oderic di Perdone (1318), and Conti (1400) did for a <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> visit. Later Betumah declined, and about 1500 was only a heap of ruins.
<h2>First Portuguese missionaries</h2>

<p>Shortly after the discovery of the Cape route to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, caravels of <a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">Portuguese</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> set out to evangelize the no longer sealed lands of the East, and traversed their surf-beaten coasts in search of suitable centres for their operations. There is a legend which tells how, when a caravel with some <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> missionaries engaged in such a search was cruising up the Coromandel Coast, one day towards nightfall their attention was attracted by a light on shore and they decided to land there. They did, without knowing then or for some time after, that they had landed at the ruins of Betumah. But when they attempted to approach the light, it preceded them inland, across the ruins of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> town, over an empty stretch of ground, past (new) Mylapur and into a forest, where the light vanished. Here the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> established a mission and built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> (still extant) in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Our Lady of Light in 1516, whence the locality, no longer a forest, but a wealthy residential quarter, is still known as The Luz &#151; after Nossa Senhora da Luz (that is, Our Lady of Light). The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> followed in their wake, and in 1520 Fre. Ambrosio, O.P., was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> missions at Cranganore and Mylapur.



<p>The following year King John III of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> ordered a search to be instituted for the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the Apostle St. Thomas. As long as the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, with the counterpart of the Ortona <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, was looked for, nothing was found; however when the search was given up, both were accidentally discovered. The royal commission found traces of the old <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, but nothing of the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. But while directing operations to build an oratory commemorative of the spot, and digging deeply in the sandy soil to lay its foundations, it found a masonry <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, containing what might have been expected to be found in the Apostle's <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>: some bones of snowy whiteness, the head of a lance, a pilgrim's staff, and an earthen vase. This was in 1522. The fact brought ruined Betumah into popularity with the Portuguese, who settled here in large numbers and called the new <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> town San Thom&eacute; (after St. Thomas) and San Thom&eacute; de Meliapor, when they wanted to distinguish it from S&atilde;o Thom&eacute; the African island, though the town was somewhat distant from Mylapur.

<p>The Portuguese Augustinians were the next missionaries to follow; they took charge of the oratory built over the grave of the Apostle, and built their <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> and church adjoining it. In the meantime the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> missions in the surrounding country gained so much in importance, that in 1540 Fre. Bernardo da Cruz, O.P., was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and sent out to tend them. There is nothing to show when the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> settled at Saint Thomas, but by 1648 they had a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in the place and a church and residence at Mylapur, while <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> spent three months in 1545 at Saint Thomas <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> at the grave of the Apostle for light in regard to his projected mission to <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. All of these missionaries, and those who came after them, had no definite spheres of work, but worked side by side and in dependence on the local ordinaries, when these were in due course appointed. By the end of the sixteenth century they had extended their operations to Bengal and Burma. In 1552 the <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Diocese of Cochin</a> was erected, and made to include, among other places, <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a> and the countries bordering the Bay of Bengal. Saint Thomas was thus constituted a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Diocese of Cochin</a>; and the Augustinian church adjoining the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> over the grave of the Apostle was designated the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of Saint Thomas.
<h2>Creation of the diocese</h2>

<p>At the instance of King Philip II of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>, on 9 January, 1606, separated rated the Kingdom of Tanjore and the territories to the north of the Cauvery River and bordering the Bay of Bengal, from the <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Diocese of Cochin</a> and constituted them a distinct diocese with Saint Thomas of Myrapur as the episcopal city and the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of Saint Thomas as the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. At the same time the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> appointed Dom Sebasti&atilde;o de San Pedro, O.S.A., who had been presented by the King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, to be the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Saint Thomas of Mylapur, and granted Philip and his heirs and successors in perpetuity the right of patronage and presentation to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> that might be created therein, by the mere facts of their creation and dotation. This right and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> the Crown of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> has exercised and discharged to the present, by making the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> a princely allowance, paying a certain number of priests' salaries, with periodical increases, leave with free passages and pensions, on the lines of the Portuguese Civil Service Code, and contributing to the support of a still larger number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> on a graduated scale. Bishop Sebasti&atilde;o de San Pedro arrived at Saint Thomas in 1611, but in 1614 was promoted to the <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">See of Cochin</a>. In 1615 he was succeeded by Luiz de Brito e Menezes, likewise an Augustinian, who was transferred in 1628 to the <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">See of Cochin</a>. His successor was Luiz Paulo Paulo de Estrella, O.S.F., appointed in 1534, who died at Saint Thomas on 9 January, 1637. During the next fifty-six years the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> continued vacant; for, though no less than nine personages were selected by the Crown for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, they either declined it, or were promoted, or died before their election was confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. So in the interval the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was governed by administrators selected chiefly from the various <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and appointed by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> or vicars capitular <em>sede vacante</em> of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>. But it was only natural that the members of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders as also <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> of other nations should have desired to share in the work of preaching the Gospel to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>; hence in 1622 <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a> created the Sacred Congregation <em>de propaganda fide</em> to distribute infidel regions among the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and missionary <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of other nationalities as assistants to the local ordinaries, where there were any, and to supervise their operations. But occasionally the Congregation was misled &#151; a thing that was easy enough when geographical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was neither as correct nor as extensive as at the present time and this occasioned trouble.

<p>The foundations of the British Indian Empire of the present day were laid, so to say, by Sir Francis Day in the sandy delta of a tiny river, some three and a half miles north of Saint Thomas, with the beginnings of Fort St. George. The British invited the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> of pure and mixed descent to settle in the new township; and as the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, they were ministered to by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> from Saint Thomas. In 1642, the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a> sent out two <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> to establish a mission in <a href="../cathen/03082a.htm">Burma</a>. But, when they, landing at Surat and travelling overland, reached Fort St. George, the British persuaded them not to go further, since they judged it prudent to have <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a> differing in nationality from, and independent of, the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> ordinary at Saint Thomas to minister to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in their settlement. Accordingly, R. P. Ephraim', one of the two, wrote to the Sacred Congregation <em>de propaganda fide</em> representing that there was a prospect of reaping a larger harvest at Fort St. George and the fast rising native town of <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a> that was beside it, than in Burma; and in the name of <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> a <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefecture Apostolic</a> was established within three and a half miles of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Saint Thomas. It is perhaps needless to say that ever after there were continual bickerings between the local ordinaries and the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, the former insisting on the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> acknowledging their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, a claim which the latter, relying on their <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Brief</a>, refused to recognize.

<p>Both the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> and the British had obtained their charters for their respective forts of Saint Thomas and St. George from the local <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> chiefs. But the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> were now extending their power southwards; and before laying siege to Fort St. George they, with the help of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> who bombarded the place from the sea, took Saint Thomas and began the work of demolishing its walls in January, 1697. The <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> governors then settled on the waste land, separating Saint Thomas from Mylapur, which was soon covered with the residences of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> settlers. In the unchanging East these three townships still exist: as a <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> quarter, as a <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> quarter and as a Brahmin quarter &#151; while the casual observer fails to see where Saint Thomas ends and Mylapur begins and uses the names as convertible terms. However, having reduced Saint Thomas and deprived it of its battlements, the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> did not further trouble the resident Portuguese, who regarded the place as still a Portuguese possession and managed its affairs with an elected council of which the <a href="../cathen/11284b.htm">ordinary</a> of the place, for the time being, was the president.

<p>Dom Gaspar Alfonso Alvares, S.J., was the fourth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Saint Thomas. His presentation was confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in 1691, and he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> in 1693. In the meantime the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> of the French Prefecture Apostolic of Fort St. George spread apace and took charge of the French settlement of <a href="../cathen/12228c.htm">Pondicherry</a>. Not to offend the French, Dom Gaspar allowed them to minister to the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> and their descendants, but in order to assert his right, placed the Indian <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in Pondicherry under the care of members of his own <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. This led to a number of complaints being addressed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> about the interference of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Saint Thomas of Mylapur with the work of the missionaries Apostolic, with the result, however, that <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, by his letters &quot;Gaudium in Domino&quot; of 1704, issued an injunction restraining the missionaries from invading the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a>. But the Congregation <em>de propaganda fide</em> seems to have followed an altogether different course. In 1706 it issued a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> in support of its own missionaries, which reversed what the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>. Under these circumstances the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> again appealed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> &quot;Non sine gravi&quot; of 1711, annulled the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Congregation and reaffirmed the right of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> to make what arrangements he chose at <a href="../cathen/12228c.htm">Pondicherry</a>, which was situated within the limits of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Presently Cardinal de Tournon, who was on his way to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, having touched at <a href="../cathen/12228c.htm">Pondicherry</a>, hearing of the doings of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, placed the French Prefecture Apostolic of <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>, the name by which Fort St. George and its surroundings were coming to be better known, under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> must have submitted forthwith and the <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> thereupon been removed, as there appears no record of its removal.

<p>In the meantime Dom Gaspar had died (1708). Owing to his advancing years, he had been given a coadjutor with the right of succession, Dom Francisco Laynes, S.J., of the Madura mission, in the <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Diocese of Cochin</a>. Dom Laynes was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> on 19 March, 1708, as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14166a.htm">Sozopolis</a> <em><a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">in partibus</a></em>. He came out to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> the same year, but did not take possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> till 1710. Though Bishop Laynes was Portuguese, the Portuguese Augustinians of Bandel defied his authority as their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a>. He therefore placed Bandel under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> on 14 July, 1714; on the submission of the Augustinians the <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> was removed (8 October, 1714). Bishop Laynes died at Chandernagore (Bengal) in 1715, and was succeeded by Manoel Sanches Gol&atilde;o, who was appointed in 1717 and reached <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> in 1719. It was Dom Manoel who welcomed the Italian <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a> as invaluable co-operators in the work of preaching the Gospel in <a href="../cathen/03082a.htm">Burma</a>, though he had regularly served mission stations there. These friendly relations with the Italian <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a> were always maintained, as they recognized the authority of the diocesans. Bishop Gol&atilde;o was succeeded by Jos&eacute; Penheiro, S.J., who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1726. He sanctioned the arrangement whereby <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were to have spiritual charge of Chandernagore, in Bengal. During his time the <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabite</a> mission in Burma was created a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a>. Bishop Pinheiro died on 15 March, 1744, and was succeeded by Antonio da Incarnacao, O.S.A., who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> in 1747.

<p>It was about this time (1746) that the French marched on Madras and, making Saint Thomas their head-quarters, attacked and took Fort St. George, which they held and improved till August, 1749, when they restored it to Admiral Boseawen under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. Saint Thomas had been nominally a Portuguese possession from 1697, without the semblance of a military force to resist its occupation by a foreign power, as the French did when operating against Madras. To obviate a recurrence of such an eventuality Admiral Boscawen annexed the place and built a redoubt to the south-east of it, thus rendering it a part of <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>, as it still is. The British now regretted having harboured the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, as they suspected that the capture of Fort St. George by the French was largely due to the information supplied by them. Consequently R. P. Rene, on whom the suspicion rested most heavily, was deported to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and the others were expelled from the fort and settled in what is now Georgetown (Madras), where the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a> now stands, four miles from the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Saint Thomas.

<p>On the death of Bishop da Incarnac&atilde;o on 22 November, 1752, Fre. Theodoro de Santa Maria, O.S.A., was presented for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> and confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. He belonged to the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> at Saint Thomas, but hesitated to receive episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Two Italian <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a> destined for the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> in Burma came with letters of commendation to the bishop-elect, who welcomed and speeded them to their destination. At last Fre. Thedoro, the bishop-elect, renounced the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> into the hands of Fre. Bernardo de San Caetano, O.S.A., who was then <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Bishop Bernardo in turn <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> one of the two <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a> just mentioned, Dom Percotto, Bishop and <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Burma, in 1768. But Bishop Percotto did not reach the field of his labours, as on his voyage back to Burma the vessel foundered.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13381b.htm">Diocese of Saint Thomas</a> of Mylapur was ministered to at this period as follows: &#151; By the Portuguese <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, Portuguese <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, Portuguese Augustinians, and Portuguese <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Besides these, there were <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and Italian <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a> working in the diocese in harmony with the ordinary, And <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> defying their authority, at least occasionally. One drawback of this total manning of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders was the absolute neglect to form an indigenous <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to meet the emergency that presently arose. For it was at about this time that the <a href="../cathen/12224b.htm">Marquess of Pombal</a> suppressed the houses of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and thus cut off the supply of <a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">Portuguese</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to the diocese. The emergency became still more acute, when, in 1773, <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a> <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppressed the Society of Jesus</a>. Withal, the situation was not quite so hopeless as to call for drastic measures in regard to the diocese from without. For it was not till 1834 that the houses of the other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders in the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> dominions were suppressed. And as the <a href="../cathen/13381b.htm">Diocese of Saint Thomas</a> of Mylapur was situated wholly outside of <a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">Portuguese</a> territory, there was nothing to prevent the Portuguese <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders from thriving there. Nevertheless, as at home vocations became fewer, the houses in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> gradually died out, the last to be represented in the diocese being the Portuguese Augustinians in Bengal, the last member of the order dying in 1869.

<p>On the extinction of a religious house in any place, the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the religious revert to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as represented by the local diocesans. But all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> was so incensed against <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> for the initiative taken by the <a href="../cathen/12224b.htm">Marquess of Pombal</a> against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, that without waiting to weigh the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of their action in turn, reprisals became the order of the day in the <a href="../cathen/13381b.htm">Diocese of Saint Thomas</a> of Mylapur, the Congregation <em>de propaganda fide</em> supporting the missionaries of other nationalities against the Portuguese. On the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Society of Jesus</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, the Fathers of the Missions &eacute;trang&egrave;res of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> were sent out to take charge of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society's</a> missions in the Dioceses of Saint Thomas of Mylapur and of <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a>, of which Msgr Champenois, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dolichum <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">in partibus</a>, was appointed <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. Bishop San Caetano resented this, as he was filling up the places of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> with Indian secular missionaries from <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>; but his protests were of little avail. In course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, as the members of the other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders died out, these same Indian missioners from <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> assumed charge of their churches under the order of their diocesans, though more often than not there was a dispute between them and the missionaries Apostolic. The latter did not hesitate to misrepresent the Goan missionaries to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and immoral as a whole though the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> was conducted by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> until their <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression</a>, and thereafter by members of the other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders till 1835. On the other hand, between 1652 and 1843, no less than seven of their fellow-countrymen were deemed worthy of episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> by the Crown of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Sacred Congregation <em>de Propaganda Fide</em></a>, not to speak of the <a href="../cathen/15317b.htm">Venerable Joseph Vaz</a>, who was of their race. Howbeit, since then and up to the present time the majority of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> working in the diocese have been Indian Secular missionaries from <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>.

<p>Bishop San Caetano died in 1780, and was succeeded by Fre. Manoel de Jesus Marie Jos&eacute;, O.S.A., a native of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the Augustinian <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> there. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1788, and died at Saint Thomas in 1800. He was succeeded by Fre. Joaquim de Menezes e Athalde, O.S.A., who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and took charge of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> by procuration in 1805, but before he could come out he was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/06318c.htm">Diocese of Funchal</a>. As a result, Fre. Jos&eacute; de Garca who on the death of Bishop Jesus Maria Jos&eacute; had been appointed administrator, continued as such till his death on 14 July, 181.7, when Fre. Clemente de Espiritu Santo, O.S.F., was appointed administrator. During the latter's tenure of his office, Madras was visited by Dom Pedro d'Aleantara, O.C., <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Antipheles <em><a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">in partibus</a></em> and <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Grand Mogul [sic] and visitor Apostolic of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> missions, who &quot;according to the mind of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Sacred Congregation <em>de Propaganda Fide</em></a> declared the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> of <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a> to be independent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Saint Thomas of Mylapur not alone in temporal but also in spiritual matters&quot;. But the administrator declined to accept his decision, as being a reaffirmation of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the same Sacred Congregation, which had been annulled. Fre. Clemente resigned the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> to Fire. Manoel de Ave Maria, O.S.A., in 1820.

<p>The British power was now paramount on the Coromandel Coast, and English was universally spoken by the Indo-European population that formed the mainstay of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> congregation of <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>, as it always was and still is all over <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. Withal, the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> would not conform to the times, but continued to preach in Portuguese (which had degenerated in Madras to a patois) and Tamil, the language of the Indian <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. As a result, many Indo-European <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> gave up the practice of their religion and in time became <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. Finding their representations to the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefect Apostolic</a> unheeded, a band of young men represented the matter to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In response to this appeal the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Sacred Congregation de Propaganda Fide</a> raised the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> prefecture into a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> and sent out Dr. O'Connor, 0 S A with <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, in 1828 to take over the work of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a>.
<h2>Portuguese Civil War of 1826, and its consequences</h2>

<p>On the outbreak of the Peninsular <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, King Jo&atilde;o VI of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, with his elder son Dom Pedro, sought refuge in <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>. Presently a movement was set on foot to have his younger son, Dom Miguel, proclaimed king, a movement which had the support of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, but not of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. However, Jo&atilde;o returned to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and quelled the insurrection. In the meantime <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> proclaimed its independence with Dom Pedro as its emperor an arrangement in which Jo&atilde;o acquiesced. On the death of Jo&atilde;o VI the loyalists in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> proclaimed Dom Pedro of <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>; but, as Dom Pedro preferred staying in <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, he ceded his right to Dona Maria da Gloria, his younger daughter, appointing his brother, Dom Miguel, as regent till she should grow up, when the regent was to marry her and thus heal the rupture between the loyalists and the adherents of Dom Miguel. The adherents of Dom Miguel, however, proclaimed him king. Dom Pedro came over to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> in 1826 to assert his daughter's <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, and finally defeated his brother in 1834. Dom Miguel was perpetually banished and those who sided with him were punished, amongst those to suffer being the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, whose houses were suppressed and properties confiscated.

<p>In consequence of this last measure mainly, diplomatic relations between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> were broken off. The <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Sacred Congregation <em>de Propaganda Fide</em></a> deemed the moment opportune to extend the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a> to Saint Thomas of Mylapur and its missions southwards to the River Palar (those south of the Palar being assigned to the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/12228c.htm">Pondicherry</a>), to declare Burma to be an independent vicariate and to create in the northern part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (Bengal and the adjoining countries) an independent <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> under Dr. St. Leger, with a staff of British <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. From a certain point of view this action was unfortunate, as under the circumstances it caused the loyalist Portuguese to regard these measures as retaliatory and not as prompted by a desire for the spiritual welfare of the regions concerned. And, indeed there was nothing up to this to show that <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> had shirked her responsibilities in regard to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, or that the successive ordinaries of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> had been found wanting, beyond the mere accusation of those missionaries Apostolic who were sent into their territories and, failing to recognize their authority, had received scant courtesy. Howbeit, when called upon by the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a> to surrender his churches and submit to him, the administrator replied that he would gladly do so when instructed by the authority that placed him there. The <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> then called upon the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the subjects of the <a href="../cathen/13381b.htm">Diocese of Saint Thomas</a> of Mylapur to submit to him, but they all replied in much the same terms. The same thing happened in the parts of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> between the Rivers Palar and Cauvery, and in Bengal; whereupon the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> declared the administrator, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and people of the <a href="../cathen/13381b.htm">Diocese of Saint Thomas</a> of Mylapur schismatics, and from the fact that a large number of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the diocese were from <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, defined their action as the &quot;Goan <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>&quot;. However the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> seems not to have taken much notice of the &quot; <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> &quot; and diplomatic relations were resumed with <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> in 1841. Then followed a series of acts unworthy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when both sides strove to capture or recapture churches that they claimed; when church was built against church, altar raised against altar, and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and police-courts were a common resort.

<p>On 14 March, 1836, Dom Antonio Trist&atilde;o Vaz Teixeira was presented by the Crown of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Saint Thomas of Mylapur, and left <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> for <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> a month later. As the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> had in the meantime refused to confirm the presentation, the <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">Vicar Capitular</a> of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> appointed him administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in place of Fre. Ave Maria, who had died on 5 August of the same year. Dom Antonio assumed charge on 15 October following, and died on 3 September, 1852. He was succeeded by Padre Miguel Francisco Lobo, an Indian from <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> (as were all the administrators of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> up to 1886), who was appointed on 3 October, 1852.

<p>On the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> returned to the parts of the <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Diocese of Cochin</a>, which their Portuguese brethren had evangelized; though opposed by the authorities of that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; and in 1846, the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation <em>de Propaganda Fide</em></a> erected their missions into a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a>. In 1850 the <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesians</a> of <a href="../cathen/01540a.htm">Annecy</a> were sent out to take charge of the country between the Rivers Godavery and Mahanuddy, which was at the same time created a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a>. In the same year, the country between the Chittagong and Kabudak River was created a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a>, and committed to the care of the Fathers of the Holy Crow; while at about the same time the Fathers of Missions etrangeres of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> replaced the Italian <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a> in <a href="../cathen/03082a.htm">Burma</a>. Thus the Diocese of Mylapur was divided up between six vicariates: Madura, <a href="../cathen/12228c.htm">Pondicherry</a>, <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>, <a href="../cathen/15496a.htm">Vizagapatam</a>, Western Bengal, and Eastern Bengal and Burma.

<p>In 1857 a concordat was entered into between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, pending the execution of which both the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> and the authorities of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> were to enjoy pacific possession of the places they actually held. But the Crown of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> undertook manifestly too great a burden, to wit, to provide for the spiritual needs of the whole of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and consequently the concordat remained a dead letter. In 1854 the Royal Missionary College of Bomjardim at Sernache, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> was founded for the training of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> missions beyond the seas. Meanwhile the missions of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> had been greatly weakened by secessions to the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>. The missions were situated in British territory and as beyond the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> there were scarcely any Portuguese subjects to be found through- out the diocese there was no particular inducement or the people to cling to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>.

<p>In Madras itself, the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> and missionaries had been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/10087b.htm">Maynooth College</a>, and almost all of them were <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of divinity. They were socially and intellectually on an equality with the best British talent. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> crowded to hear their sermons in churches and their lectures on scientific matters. When Dr. O'Connor first came out, he brought letters of introduction to the governor and was a guest at Government House. On the first occasion when he drove to St. Mary's of the Angels, the quasi-cathedral of his vicariate wearing a cocked hat and buckled shoes, long coat and knee-breeches, the old ladies protested that he could be no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> but the emissary of the Government to make them all <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. These things lent prestige to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> name. One of the first things the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> missionaries did was to open a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> (to which a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was attached) and ordain IndoEuropean <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> of invaluable help to them. They also brought out the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Presentation <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are yet the best in all Southern <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. As a result, almost all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indo-Europeans and Indians with pretensions to respectability flocked to the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, till in the end it was deemed opprobrious to term one as belonging to the <a href="../cathen/13381b.htm">Diocese of Saint Thomas</a> of Mylapur. Hence in the course of the negotiations preparatory to the fresh concordat of 1886, the cardinal secretary of State was in a position to show that out of 1,167,975 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in British <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> missions of the <a href="../cathen/13381b.htm">Diocese of Saint Thomas</a> of Mylapur could actually claim only some 30,000 subjects, with a proportionate number of churches, one <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> from which a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was occasionally <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, one high school at Saint Thomas, two middle <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at Tuticorin and Manapad, and a number of elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; while any single <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> had a better equipment. But of these 30,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which were all that were left to the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> of the once flourishing diocese, it has truly, though scarcely laudably, been said that &quot;they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> more than their own <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> &quot;.
<h2>Present condition</h2>

<p>Such was the state of affairs when in 1886 a fresh concordat was entered into between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, which showed itself disposed to accommodate itself to the changed conditions of the times. The concordat was preceded by negotiations with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, to make sure that the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government would not object to the continuance of the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> royal patronage in its Eastern possessions. Accordingly, the Primacy of the East of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> was reaffirmed, while in addition they were accorded the honorary title of Patriarchs of the East Indies and the substantial privilege of presiding at the plenary council of the East Indies, which were ordinarily to assemble at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, while the special relations existing between the <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Archdiocese of Goa</a> and its suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were to be continued. But the limits of the original Portuguese <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were contracted, the <a href="../cathen/13381b.htm">Diocese of Saint Thomas</a> of Mylapur being assigned two distinct pieces of territory on the Coromandel Coast, separated from each other by a distance of some 150 miles. The first is a triangle of an area of some 800 square miles, in the northern angle of which Saint Thomas is situated; the other is roughly the ancient Kingdom of Tanjore. In addition, both by the concordat and certain appendixes thereto, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was given five churches in the Archdiocese Of Madras &#151; the old <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariates Apostolic</a> having been converted into <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> as a sequel to the concordat by the Constitution &quot;Humanae salutis&quot; of 1886, of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> &#151; three churches in the <a href="../cathen/03152a.htm">Archdiocese of Calcutta</a> (Western Bengal), five churches in the <a href="../cathen/04601b.htm">Diocese of Dacca</a> (Eastern Bengal), and twenty-four churches in the <a href="../cathen/15040d.htm">Diocese of Trichinopoly</a> (which originally belonged to the <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Diocese of Cochin</a>), with their congregations.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> appointed to Saint Thomas of Mylapur on the conclusion of the new concordat was the princely Dom Henrique Jos&eacute; Reed da Silva, who was at the time coadjutor to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, and who took possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1886. He was the first to sign himself for the sake of brevity, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mylapur, a practice which his successors have adopted. Hence the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is at the present time better known in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> as the Diocese of Mylapur. His was the arduous task of gathering the broken shreds of the old historic diocese, putting them together, and rendering it once again the thing of beauty it was. His first care was to reform the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and in order to have an efficient body of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> with their heart in their work, he brought out a number of young boys from <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and gave them a collegiate course in English, in the college to which he had raised the existing high-school, previous to their entering upon their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> course of studies. His successors are reaping the benefit of his policy. He opened a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> at Saint Thomas, and another of Indian <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> in Mylapur, which have since thrown out branches into various parts of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He invited English-speaking <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to join his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (a call to which the present writer responded) and established the &quot;Catholic Register&quot;, a weekly newspaper. His courtly manners and noble bearing made him a favourite in <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Soon the people felt it an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to be able to point to him as their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He pulled down the old <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> over the grave &#151; of St. Thomas, and the old Augustinian <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a>, that had nothing antique to commend them, and built the present magnificent <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in the centre of which, between the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> and <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a>, lies the grave of St. Thomas. Despite the good he was accomplishing, he incurred the ill-will of certain parties connected with the churches situated in other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and when he found the accusations brought against him accepted without demur in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, he resigned and retired to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15016a.htm">Trajanopolis</a>.

<p>He was succeeded by Dom Antonio Jos&eacute; de Souza Barroso, who, within a few months of his arrival at Saint Thomas, was promoted to the <a href="../cathen/11260a.htm">See of Oporto</a>. Bishop Barroso was succeeded by the present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Dom Theotonio Manuel Ribeiro Vieira de Castro, who was presented on 12 June, 1899, and confirmed by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> ten days later. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/11260a.htm">Oporto</a> on 15 August, 1899, and reached Saint Thomas on 23 December. The tercentenary of the creation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> occurred in January, 1906, in which almost all of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the vast tract that constituted the original <a href="../cathen/13381b.htm">Diocese of Saint Thomas</a> of Mylapur took part in person in addition to the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">delegate Apostolic</a> and other <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, numbering fifteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in all. It is instructive to note, that with the single exception of the <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Archdiocese of Madras</a>, all of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> into which the original <a href="../cathen/13381b.htm">Diocese of Saint Thomas</a> of Mylapur is divided are served by non-British <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, save for the Indian and few Indo-European <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, where there are any. But even in the <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Archdiocese of Madras</a>, though it is served by the British Missionary Society of St. Joseph, the majority of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> are from the Continent. Dacca is served by the Fathers of the Holy Cross from Notre Dame, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of America</a>.

<p>According to the latest available statistics, there are in the diocese some 72,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 20 <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> and 51 Indian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, I <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. For boys there are: 2 high schools at Saint Thomas, one being for Indo-Europeans, the other for Indian <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; 3 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, one for Indo-Europeans at Saint Thomas, another for Indian <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> at Tanjore, managed by the <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesians</a>, and the third at <a href="../cathen/03152a.htm">Calcutta</a> for Indian <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. For girls: 2 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Missionary Nuns of Mary, at Saint Thomas and at St. Thomas's Mount, which maintain <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> attached to them both for IndoEuropeans and Indians, the latter of whom are mainly looked after by Indian Sisters of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis; 6 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of Indian <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> Institute of Our Lady of Help, in populous centres, with <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and boarding establishments for Indian caste girls; there are also 8 middle-schools and 57 primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The conversions for the year ending 30 September, 1907 totalled about 200, of which 135 were from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a>, 63 from <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> and 8 from <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> under instruction at the same time numbered 141. Thus is <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> in the beginning of the twentieth century continuing the work inaugurated on the Coromandel Coast in the beginning of the sixteenth, in the days when the <a href="../cathen/06374a.htm">Vasco de Gamas</a>, <a href="../cathen/03128a.htm">Cabrals</a>, and de Albuquerques were not the mere shadowy heroes of the past, but walked the earth in living flesh and did their deeds of daring.
