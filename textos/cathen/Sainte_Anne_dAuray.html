<h1>Sainte Anne d'Auray</h1>  

<p>A little village three miles from the town of Auray (6,500 inhabitants), in the <a href="../cathen/15271b.htm">Diocese of Vannes</a> (Morbihan), in French Brittany, famous for its sanctuary and for its <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>, or <em>pardons</em>, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/01538a.htm">St. Anne</a>, to whom the people of Brittany, in very early times, on becoming <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, had dedicated a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. This first <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was destroyed about the end of the seventh century, but the memory of it was kept alive by tradition, and the village was still called "Keranna", i.e. "Village of Anne". More than nine centuries later, at the beginning of the seventeenth century (1624-25), St. Anne is said to have appeared several times to a simple and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> villager, and commanded him to rebuild the ancient <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. The apparitions became so frequent, and before so many witnesses, that Sebastien de Rosmadec, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15271b.htm">Vannes</a>, deemed it his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to inquire into the matter. Yves Nicolazic, to whom St. Anne had appeared, and numerous witnesses, testified to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of events which had become famous throughout Brittany, and the Bishop gave permission for the building of a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. Anne of Austria and Louis XIII enriched the sanctuary with many gifts, among them a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of St. Anne brought from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in the thirteenth century, and in 1641 the Queen obtained from the Pope the erection of a confraternity, which <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> raised to the rank of an archconfraternity in 1872. In the meanwhile <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> had begun and became more numerous year by year, nor did the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> put a stop to them. The <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, indeed was plundered, the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> who served it driven out, and the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of St. Anne was burned at <a href="../cathen/15271b.htm">Vannes</a> in 1793; yet the faithful still flocked to the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, which was covered with ex-votos. In 1810 the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> was turned into a <em>petit s&eacute;minaire</em>. In 1866, the Cardinal Saint Marc laid and blessed the first stone of the present magnificent basilica. Finally, in 1868, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> accorded to the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of St. Anne, before which many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> had been wrought, the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of being <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a>. St. Anne has continued to be the favourite <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of Brittany down to the present day: <blockquote> <br>C'est notre m&egrave;re &agrave; tous; mort ou vivant, dit-on, <br>A Sainte-Anne, une fois, doit aller tout Breton. </blockquote>

<p>The basilica, which is in <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> style, is a work of art. The marbles of the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> are the gift of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>; many of the <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-reliefs</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of Nicolazic and Keriolet, are the work of the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> Falguihre. The principal <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> take place at Pentecost and on the 26 July.
