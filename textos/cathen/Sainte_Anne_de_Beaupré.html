<h1>Sainte Anne de Beaupr&eacute;</h1>  

<p>Devotion to <a href="../cathen/01538a.htm">Saint Anne</a>, in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, goes back to the beginning of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a>, and was brought thither by the first settlers and early missionaries. The hardy pioneers soon began to till the fertile soil of the Beaupr&eacute; hillside; in the region which now forms the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Sainte Anne de Beaupr&eacute; the first houses date from the year 1650. Nor was it long before the settlers built themselves a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> where they might meet for Divine worship. One of their number, the Sieur Etienne Lessard, offered to give the land required at the spot which the church authorities should find suitable. On 13 March, 1658, therefore, the missionary, Father Vignal, came to choose the site and to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> the foundation of the proposed <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> which, by general consent, was to be dedicated to St. Anne. The very day the Saint showed how favourably she viewed the undertaking by healing Louis Guimont, an inhabitant of Beaupr&eacute;, who suffered terribly from rheumatism of the loins. Full of confidence in St. Anne, he came forward and placed three stones in the foundations of the new building, whereupon he found himself suddenly and completely cured of his ailment.

<p>This first authentic <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> was the precursor of countless other <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> and favours of all kinds. For two centuries and a half the great wonder-worker has ceaselessly and lavishly shown her kindness to all the sufferers who from all parts of North America flock every year to Beaupr&eacute; to implore her help. The old church was begun in 1676, and used for worship until 1876, when it was replaced by the present one, opened in October of that year. This last was built of cut stone, by means of contributions from all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. The offerings made by <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> have defrayed the cost of fittings and decoration. It is two hundred feet long, and one hundred wide, including the side <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> raised it to the rank of a minor basilica 5 May, 1887; on 19 May, 1889, it was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/14462b.htm">Cardinal Taschereau</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Quebec. It has been served by the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> since 1878. On either side of the main doorway are huge pyramids of crutches, walking-sticks, bandages, and other appliances left behind by the cripples, lame, and sick, who, having <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to St. Anne at her shrine, have gone home healed.
<h2>Relics</h2>

<p>The canons of <a href="../cathen/03331b.htm">Carcassonne</a>, at the request of Monseigneur de Laval, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec, sent to Beaupr&eacute; a large <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the finger-bone of Saint Anne, which was first exposed for veneration on 12 March, 1670, and has ever since been an object of great devotion. Three other <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> have been added in later times to the treasures of this shrine. In 1892 Cardinal Taschedreau presented the Great Relic to the basilica, the wrist-bone of St. Anne. It measures four inches in length, and was brought from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Msgr. Marquis, P.A.
<h2>Pilgrimage</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Beaupr&eacute; has not always had the importance which it has gained in our time. Only in the last quarter of the nineteenth century did it attain to the growth, organization, and fame which now render it comparable with the great <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> to Lourdes. Until 1875 the yearly number of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> did not exceed 12,000, but to judge by the heap of crutches left at the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> feet, there must always have been many marvellous cures wrought at Beaupr&eacute;. More favourable conditions &#151; including the strong impulse given by <a href="../cathen/14462b.htm">Cardinal Taschereau</a> and his suffragans, the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in organizing <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>, improved modes of transportation, and the monthly "Annales de la Bonne Sainte Anne" &#151; made possible the truly wonderful growth of these <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> in the early twentieth century. Devotion to St. Anne is today more than ever the devotion of the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a>.
