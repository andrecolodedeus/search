<h1>Salamanca</h1>  

<p>(SALMANTICENSIS, SALMANTINA, SALMANTICAE).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; comprises the civil Provinces of Salamanca, C&aacute;ceres, <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a>, and L&eacute;on, and is bounded on the north by Zamora, on the east by Avila and Valladolic, on the south by C&aacute;ceres, and on the west by <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. The episcopal city has a population of 23,000. Its territory formed the southern portion of the ancient Vetonia, and the existence of the city of Salamanca in the Roman period is evidenced by a pretentious bridge over the River Tornes, with twenty-seven arches, measuring 500 paces in length, and probably erected in the time of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>.

<p>The See of Salamanca is of unknown origin, probably dating back to the generation immediately after the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, in which generation St. Secundus is said to have founded the <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Diocese of Avila</a>. Signatures of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Salamanca are found in the Councils of Toledo; in the third council is that of Eleutherius; at the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of King Gondemar, that of Teveristus; in the fourth and sixth of Hiccila; in the seventh, eighth and tenth, of Egeretus; in the <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/10202a.htm">M&eacute;rida</a> (metropolis of Salamanca) the signature of Justus;in the twelfth of Toledo that of Providentius; in the thirteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth, of Holemund, probably contemporaneous with the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> invasion. Alfonso I the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> pushed his conquests as far as Salamanca, and Ordo&ntilde;o I captured the city, but its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> continued to reside in Asturias, where the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Julian, outside the walls of <a href="../cathen/11363a.htm">Oviedo</a>, was assigned to them. Bishop Quindulfus (802) signed a royal deed of gift. Ramiro II, who defeated the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> at Simancas, began to repeople Saamanca. In 1102 the king's son-in-law Raymond, Count of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, and his wife Urraca, gave the churches of the city to Don Jer&oacute;nimo, the count's master, and built the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of S. Mar&iacute;a. The celebrated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, comrade of the <a href="../cathen/03769a.htm">Cid Campeador</a>, died in 1120 and was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the newly-built basilica, to which he left the famous "Christ of the Battles" (Cristo de las Batallas).

<p>Later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were: Gerardo; Munio, a partisan of Alfonso of Arag&oacute;n: Berengario, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1135 and transferred to Compostela in 1151; Navarro; Ordo&ntilde;o Gonz&aacute;lo; Pedro Su&aacute;rez, praised by <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> for learning and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; and Vitalis, who maintained he validity of Alfoonso IX's marriage with his cousin Teresa of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> against the censures of Celetine III and the sentence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> presided over by Cardinal Guillermo in 1197. From his period date the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and the most ancient and famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, and Clarisses. In October, 1310, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> being vacant, fifteen <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the ancient Province of Lusitania, presided over by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Santiago, assembled in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Salamanca to try the case of <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a>, and found them innocent in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> of all the atrocities with which they were charged. Bishop Juan Lucero accompanied King Alfonso XI to the conquest of Algeciras. Later on he became subservient to the caprices of Pedro I the Cruel and annulled (1354) his marriage with Blanche of Bourbon in order to unite him with Juana de Castro. Lucero's successor, Alsonso Barrasa, on the conrary, supported Henry of Trastamare against Pedro. In May, 1382, a council was held at Salamanca to take action in the matter of the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">schism of Avignon</a>, and Castile decided in favour of the <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">antipope</a>. In another council (1410) Salamanca again recognized <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Peter de Luna (Benedict XIII)</a> as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. At this time Vincent Ferrer laboured to convert the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of Saamanca; from 1460 to 1478 St. John of Sahag&uacute;n enlightened the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of his preaching.

<p>Salamanca has two <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>; the old, celebrated for its massive strength, was founded in 1100 by the aforesaid Count Raymond near the River Gate (Puerta del Rio). At the end of the thirteenth century it was not yet finished, and its man entrance, called Del Perd&oacute;n (of the Pardon), was covered over in 1680 with new Doric and Composite pilasters. In 1847 it was freed of its inartistic choir. Its building occupied so long a time that Gothic ogival arches are supported by its Byzantine foundations. Of its three <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a> the principal one terminates in the main <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> on the reredos of which is to be seen the "Last Judgment" <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of Nicol&aacute;s Florentino in 1446 for Bisop Sancho of Castile. In early days none but royal personnages were permitted to be buried in this main <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>; here lie Mafalda, daughter of Alfonso VIII, Fernando Alfonso, natural son of Alfonso IX of Le&oacute;n, Bishop Sancho of Castile, Grandson of Pedro, and his successor, Juan de Vivero. The cloister of the old <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was Romanesque, but in 1780 Jer&oacute;nimo Qui&ntilde;ones rebuilt it in <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> style. Most remarkable of ts four <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, is that of St. Bartholomew, founded by Diego de Anaya, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Salamanca until 1480, and then <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, and founder of the famous Colegio de San Bartolom&eacute;. There are also the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of Talavera, which was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the Mozarabic Rite in 1510 and in which Rodrigo Arias Maldonado de Talavera is buried, and that of <a href="../cathen/02284d.htm">St. Barbara</a>, founded in 1384 by Bishop Juan Lucero.

<p>The new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was founded by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> monarchs, who in 1491 sought to build one in <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was not carried into effect until 1508, when Fernando was at Salamanca. This new edifice was erected side by side with the old, leaving the latter intact. Its architects, Ant&oacute;n Egas and Alfonso Rodr&iacute;guez, had built churches at Toledo and Seville; Juan Gil de Honta&ntilde;on was master of works. The building was begun in 1560, and it was completed in 10 August, 1733. The tower, set on fire by lightning in 1705, was rebuilt by the celebrated Jos&eacute; Churriguera, who made it a monument of the style (Churrigueresque) to which he gave his name. In the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> at the centre of the rood screen are remains of Bishop Jer&oacute;nimo, transferred from the old basilica in 1744, and the <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> "Christ of the Battles". In two large silver vessels within the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. John of Sahag&uacute;n and <a href="../cathen/14696a.htm">St. Thomas of Villanova</a> are preserved. Besides the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>, a sumptuous church worthy of especial mention is that of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of San Esteban, occupied by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> since 1256, where, it is said, <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Christopoher Columbus</a> was entertained in 1484 and where he found Fray Diego de Deza one of his most ardent protectors. The church was rebuilt in the sixteenth century, the first stone was laid on 30 June, 1524, and the work was completed in 1610. The founder of this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> was the Salamancan Fray Juan de Toledo, of the House of Alva, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cordoba, and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; here, too, is buried the famous <a href="../cathen/01371a.htm">Duke of Alva</a> with his wife Mar&iacute;a Enriquez de Toledo. Another beautiful church is that of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, founded by King Philip III and his consort Margaret of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> in 1614. The college was converted into an <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> by Bishop Beltr&aacute;n in 1779, was made a pontifical <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and is now under the care of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. In former times there were numberous <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> at Salamanca, but in 1851 it was agreed to combine them all into one, under the care of the <a href="../cathen/02802b.htm">Brothers of St. John of God</a>, and dedicated to the Trininty. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and province, containing more than 100,000 volumes is a remarkable one.
