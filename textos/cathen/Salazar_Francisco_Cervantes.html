<h1>Salazar Francisco Cervantes</h1>  

<p>Born at Toledo, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, probably in 1513 or 1514; went to Mexico in 1550; died there in 1575. He deserves mention, especially as one of the first professors of the University of Mexico, established by order of Charies V, and opened formally, 25 January,1553. Cervantes occupied the chair of rhetoric. He wrote several important works on the history of the <a href="../cathen/10269a.htm">city of Mexico</a> and the province of New Spain in general. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> he was a professor at the University of Osuna. He was a man of solid learning and of considerable influence during his lifetime. Of his numerous writings the "Dialogos Latinos" are best known. They give in three parts a description of the young city of Mexico as it was about 1554, and notes valuable to the historian and <a href="../cathen/03705a.htm">archaeologist</a>. Not less interesting is the "T&uacute;mulo Imperial de la gran Ciudad de M&eacute;xico", printed 1560, and reprinted in 1886 by Yeazbalceta in his "Bibliografia". It refers to the funeral honours celebrated at Mexico on the occasion of the death of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, and gives not only a minute description of the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>, but of the decorations and temporary structures raised for the occasion, with one fairly executed plate. For the customs of the times it is highly valuable. The "Dialogos" were published at Mexico in 1554 in the original Latin, and in 1875 Yeazbalceta republished them in Latin, with an excellent Spanish translation and valuable notes. Cervantes has left several other works, mostly of a the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> nature, and it is known that he also wrote "History of Mexico" which is lost, but was highly praised by those who were able to consult the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>.
