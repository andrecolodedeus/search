<h1>Salem</h1>  

<p>(SALMANSWEILER)

<p>Also called Salomonis Villa on account of the resemblance of its primitive buildings to Solomon's Temple.

<p>Salem is an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> situated near the Castle of Heiligenberg, about ten miles from <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance, Baden (Germany)</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was founded by Gunthram of Adelsreute (d. 1138) in 1136 during the reign of <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Pope Innocent II</a> and Emperor Lothair II. Gunthram also gave the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Lucelle the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> lands for the first <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in Alsace, the latter being a foundation of Bellevaux, first daughter of Morimond. Blessed Frowin, formerly the travelling companion and interpreter of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, became its first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. He had been professed at Bellevaux, and was of the colony sent to found Lucelle; hence have arisen misunderstandings, some maintaining, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a>, that Salem was founded from Bellevaux.

<p>Under the wise and prudent administration of Blessed Frowin and his successors, the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> soon became very prosperous. Extensive and magnificent buildings, erected in three squares, and a splendid church were constructed between 1182 and 1311. Salem was noted as the richest and most beautiful <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, being particularly renowned for its hospitality. Amongst its greatest benefactors and patrons were Conrad of Swabia and <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a>. The former placed the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> under the special protection of himself and his successors &mdash; hence the title of "Royal Abbey" which was renewed several times under <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a> and his successors; <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> also took the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> under his particular patronage. Its growth was continuous, and even after having made three important foundations &mdash; Raitenhauslach (1143), Maristella or Wettingen (1227), and Konigsbrunn (1288) &mdash; it numbered 285 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> at the beginning of the fourteenth century. Its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, from 1454 on, was privileged to confer <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeaconship</a> on his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> gradually declined, though it numbered forty-nine <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and thirteen other choir religious in 1698, when Abbot D. Stephen (d. 1725) became <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Congregation of Upper Germany. Caspar Oexle, who, as librarian, had increased the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> to 30,000 volumes and a great number of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, was elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> in March 1802; in September of the same year the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was suppressed and given to the Princes of Baden, while the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was added to that of Petershausen, and finally sold to the <a href="../cathen/07196a.htm">University of Heidelberg</a>. The church became a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church; the grand tower with its fifteen bells, the largest weighing 10,000 lbs., was destroyed (1805), and the other buildings were used as the grand duke's castle. Eberhard, its fifth <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a Blessed of the order. He was made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, and entrusted with various important missions by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Blessed Henry, a <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a>, is also mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10191b.htm">menology</a>.
