<h1>Salerno</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in Campania, Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The city is situated on the gulf of the same name, backed by a high rock <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with an ancient castle. The surrounding country is well cultivated, and a natural harbour promotes the commerce of agricultural products; breeding of horses is carried on to a considerable extent. There are two mineral springs. The entrance to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, built by <a href="../cathen/07072b.htm">Robert Guiscard</a>, is through a great court surrounded by porticos, with columns of granite and porphyry, where several ancient sarcophagi are preserved. The middle doors are of bronze, beautifully decorated. In 1722 the interior was transformed by Peorio. The beautiful columns were shut up between pilasters of walling, and the pointed arches were ruined. Of the ancient basilica there remains a high marble candelabrum adorned with <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>; between the choir and the side of the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of Giovanni da Procida, also adorned with <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> and containing the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> to the right there is a beautiful Pieta, the finest work of Andrea Salerno. Among other treasures of the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> is an <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> altar frontal with scenes from the Old and from the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. There is a tradition that the body of St. Matthew, the apostle, is preserved in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> under the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>; the columns of the vault are beautifully incrusted with multi-coloured marbles. Among other churches are: the Annunziata; San Giorgio, which may rightly be called a picture gallery (Life of St. Benedict); and S. Domenico, where an arm of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> is preserved. Charitable institutions were, and still are, numerous.

<p>Salerno was the city of the Salentini. After <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with Hannibal (194 B.C.), a Roman colony was established there. In the Social War it was taken by the Samnites. In the eighth century the city was in the power of the Lombard dukes of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>; Arichis fortified it and took refuge there, when Charles the Great invaded his duchy. In 840 Siconulfus, brother of the Duke Sicardus who was killed by the partisans of Radelgisus, was proclaimed prince at Salerno, which from that time constituted an independent principality. With the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> and with the spoils of the churches Siconulfus defended his independence, which was confirmed in 851 by the Emperor Louis II, to whom the prince had sworn allegiance. The chief cities of the principality were <a href="../cathen/14450d.htm">Taranto</a>, Cassano, <a href="../cathen/04403a.htm">Cosenza</a>, Paestum, <a href="../cathen/04350a.htm">Conza</a>, Salerno, Sarno, Cimitile (Nola), <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, Teano, and <a href="../cathen/14148b.htm">Sora</a>. The son of Siconulfus, Sico, was dethroned by his tutor, Petrus, who was succeeded by his son Ademar; the latter, however, was deposed by a conspiracy, tortured, and blinded, while Guaiferius was put in his place (861). In 874 the port of Salerno was so well defended that the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> had to abandon the blockade of the city. Guaimarus, son of Guaiferius, struggled (880) against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a>, but on account of his cruelty he was deposed, blinded, and thrown into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. His son, Guaimarus II, ruled wisely.

<p>Gisulfus became famous through the splendour of his court. He was despoiled by the exiled Prince of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Beneventum</a>, Landolfo, but Pandolfo Capo-di-Ferro, Prince of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Beneventum</a>, restored Gisulfus (974), who, through gratitude, associated with himself in the principality Pandolfo, son of the liberator, by whom he was succeeded in 978. The latter also was deposed by Mansus III, Duke of <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a> (981), who was confirmed in the principality by Otho II. The people of Salerno, however, rebelled against him, and gave the throne to Giovanni Lamperto, a descendant of the Dukes of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>. Under his son and successor, Guaimaro III (994-1018), the people of Salerno were helped by about forty Norman warriors to repel the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. Guaimaro IV dreamed of uniting the whole of lower <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> into a single principality; he took <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a> and <a href="../cathen/14151a.htm">Sorrento</a> and warred with Argiro, master of <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a>, but was assassinated by the Amalfians in 1031. It was only with the assistance of the Normans that his son Gisulfus III was able to recover his throne. The cruelty of Gisulfus against the Amalfians gave to Robert Giuscard, brother-in-law of Gisulfus, a pretext to wage <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and to take possession of Salerno, which was <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravely</a> defended (1075). Gisulfus ended his days in the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">pontifical states</a>. Thus the last Lombard principality of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> came to an end. At the death of Guiscard his states were divided; Salerno was inherited by Roger, who was succeeded (1111) by his son William; at the latter's death Salerno gave itself to Roger II of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> (1127), from whom it was taken by the Emperor Lothair (1137), although the latter was unable to hold it. In 1196 Salerno was again besieged, by land and sea, for having held Constance, wife of Henry IV, a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>. For this offense dreadful revenge was taken and Salerno never recovered from the damage done to it in the pillage. The heirs of the first princes of the House of Anjou bore the title of Prince of Salerno; John II invested with it Girolamo Colanna, nephew of <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>. <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> suppressed the principality, but the province continued to be called Principality of Salerno.

<p>The medical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Salerno was famous in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval history</a>; it was founded neither by Charles the Great nor by the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, the city never having been under the domination of either. Its origin is to be found in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Salerno, established in 794, in which the botanical and the medical works of the ancients were studied. Its fame grew, when about the year 1070 the celebrated Costantino Africano took refuge there. He had studied in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> in Babylon, at <a href="../cathen/02202c.htm">Bagdad</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and was presented by the brother of the caliph of Babylon to Guiscard, who took him as secretary. He gave a new impulse to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and to <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medical</a> studies by making known in the West the works of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>. Robert I gave <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Salerno, which was the first Western <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> to introduce academic degrees. New regulations were established for it by <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, who ordered that no one should practise medicine without being "licensed" by that <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, the fame of which waned after the fifteenth century through the competition of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was suppressed in 1811, together with the University of Salerno. Among the famous physicians that it produced were: Garisponto, author of the "Passionarium Salerni"; Cofone (Ars medendi); and Matthaeus Platearius, author of a commentary on the "Antidotarium" of Nicolo Pietro Musandino (thirteenth century). The "Herbarium" of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Salerno was disseminated throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in the twelfth century. In the same century the rules of hygiene of this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> were collected and edited in leonine verse; these rules, which even now are not antiquated, were the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> greatest title to praise. The "Anonymus Salernitanus" who continued the history of the princes of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> from Erchempertus to 980, Andrea Sabatini a pupil of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>, and Andrea da Salerno were natives of this city.

<p>In view of its position, it was natural that Salerno should receive the light of the Gospel at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>; in fact, various <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, as Antes, Caius, and Fortunatus (28 August), suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> there. The age of Bonifacius and four other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who preceded Gaudentius on the episcopal throne is uncertain; Gaudentius, however, was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 499, which would show that the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was created towards the end of the fourth century. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were Asterius, who went to Constantinople with Pope Agapitus in 534; St Gaudiosus (eighth century); Petrus (834), formerly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Canusio, who took refuge at Salerno when the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> destroyed his capital, and built the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Giovanni Battista; Bernardus (850), a man of great virtue, who restored several buildings. In 984 Salerno became an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a>, the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> being Amato. Other <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> were: San Alfano (1058-85), who received the exiled <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>; Romualdo Guarna (1153), who took an important part in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and political affairs of the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>; Nicolo Agello (1181), taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> by Henry IV to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, where he remained for many years notwithstanding the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, especially of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>; Guglielmo de' Godoni (1298), chancellor of the Duke of Calabria, whose successors, to Orso Minutolo (1330), resided at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>; Barnaba Orsini (1441), who restored the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; Giovanni Vera (1500), later a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, who was sent on several pontifical legations to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; <a href="../cathen/13729c.htm">Girolamo Seripando</a> (1554), a famous <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and former general of the Augustinians, whose doctrines on justification, too much akin to those of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, were rejected at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, and who afterwards became a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, and died at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>; Gaspare Cervante (1564), who founded the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; Marc Antonio Colonna (1568), who established another college for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>; his nephew, Marc Antonio Colonna (1574), the author of valuable works; Mario Bolognini (1591), who distinguished himself in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in the controversies with the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>; Giovanni de Torres (1658), who reformed the lives of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; Gregorio Caraffa (1664), a <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatine</a> and a reformer; Antonio Salomone, who, after the annexation of the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> without reason (1886), and at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> was sent into exile. Since 1818 Salerno has for suffragans the Sees of <a href="../cathen/03307b.htm">Capaccio e Vallo</a>, <a href="../cathen/12212a.htm">Policastro</a>, Marsico Nuovo, and <a href="../cathen/11171a.htm">Nusco</a>. The See of Acerno, which appears a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> since 1136, is united with it in perpetual administration; among its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> mention should be made of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Antonio Bonito (1493). The <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdiocese</a> has: 155 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; 60,000 inhabitants; 600 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>; 2 institutes for boys and 4 for girls; 11 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> for men and 14 for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; and 1 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> daily paper.
