<h1>Salford</h1>  

<p>(SALFORDIENSIS)

<p>The Diocese of Salford comprises the Hundreds of Salford and Blackburn, in Lancashire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and was erected 29 Sept., 1850. It covers the east and south-eastern portions of Lancashire and embraces the manufacturing towns of <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, Salford, Blackburn, Oldham, Bury, Burnley, Rochdale, etc. Its area is practically coextensive with that of the ancient <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> deanery of <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, which was under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> or dean, but its title was taken from Salford instead of <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a> to avoid offending <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> susceptibilities, as an <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">See of Manchester</a> had been erected in 1847. The <a href="../cathen/01640a.htm">Apostolic Letter</a> of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, which divided the Lancashire District into the two Sees of <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a> and Salford, allotted to Salford the Hundred of Leyland in addition to those of Blackburn and Salford, but a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Brief</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 27 June, 1851, transferred to Liverpool the Hundred of Leyland which included the important <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> town of Preston.

<p>The Hundred of Blackburn, covering the north-western portion of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, extends twenty-four miles east to west, and fourteen miles north to south. In the chequered <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> following on the religious changes of the sixteenth century it had, with Salford, a long roll of <a href="../cathen/12677a.htm">recusants</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> for the Faith. The ruins of Whalley Abbey, a thirteenth-century <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> foundation, still bear their silent witness. Its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, John Paslew, was hanged outside its walls in 1537 for taking part in the <a href="../cathen/12084b.htm">Pilgrimage of Grace</a> in 1536; and the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was seized for the use of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>. The first post-Reformation <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in Blackburn was opened in 1773, and in Manchester in 1774. In 1843 the Rev. James Sharples, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban's</a>, Blackburn, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> and appointed coadjutor to Bishop Brown, the first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> for the Lancashire District. He built at Salford St. John's Church, which was opened in 1848 and which subsequently became the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> for the diocese. Dr. Sharples died 16 Aug., 1850, and the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Salford in the restored <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was Rt. Rev. William Turner (1790-1872). He was succeeded in 1872 by the <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Rt. Rev. Herbert Vaughan</a> (1832-1903), whose episcopate was remarkable for its energy, organizing ability and initiation of works to meet the rapid grown and development of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. On his transference to Westminster in 1892, the Rt. Rev. John Bilsborrow (1836-1903) was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The Rt. Rev. Louis Charles Casartelli, D.D., M.A., Litt.Or.D., the fourth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was born in 1852, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1876. He was closely associated with <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a> in the foundation of <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede's</a> College, <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, in 1876, and was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of it when he was nominated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1903. Bishop Casartelli is widely known as a writer on Oriental subjects, was a professor at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, and has always been very active in the theologico-literary field. The Rt. Rev. John S. Vaughan, D.D., <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13668c.htm">Sebastopolis</a>, was elected <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> in 1909.
<h2>Population</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is estimated at about 300,000, and this is largely a growth of the latter half of the nineteenth century. Although <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> memories and traditions lingered in Lancashire long after the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, in 1690 only two <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were enrolled on the Manchester Poll Book. Ten years later, thirteen <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, according to the returns of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>, existed in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a> with its area of sixty square miles. In 1775 the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> in Manchester was thirty-two, whilst the congregation of St. Chad's <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Chapel, which had been opened in 1774, was estimated at 500. A survey made for the statistical <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of the various Sunday <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a> and Salford in 1836 returned the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> as ten, with an attendance of 4295 scholars. Similar small beginnings were witnessed it the Blackburn Hundred. In 1793 there is record of twenty-six <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> for Blackburn. The number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the town in 1804 was estimated at 745, and in 1819 the number had increased to 1200 for the town and district.
<h2>Missions and priests</h2>

<p>At the present time there are in the diocese 138 public <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 48 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and 10 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of institutions in which Mass is said. The <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> number 235, and in addition there are 86 regulars belonging to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Missionary Fathers of St. Joseph, and the Congregation of the Divine Pastor.
<h2>Education</h2>

<p>A chain of efficient <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> links up the compulsory secular instruction with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religious teaching given in them. 55,000 children are on the rolls of the 140 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with their 263 departments and a teaching staff of 1591 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers. A training college for residential <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> teachers, conducted by the Order of the Faithful Companions of Jesus, adds to the completeness of the organization for elementary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. For secondary or higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> there are 18 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and colleges. Stonyhurst, the great <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, is the successor of the College of St. Omer, which was founded by Father Robert Parsons, S.J., in 1592 and transferred to Lancashire on 29 Aug., 1794.
<h2>Works of charity</h2>

<p>One of the great works of <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a> during his Salford episcopate was the founding of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Protection and Rescue Society in July, 1886. The object was to protect and save the destitute <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> child whose Faith was in danger. 6569 boys and girls have passed through its homes during the years 1886-1911, and its annual expenditure exceeds x4000. The "Harvest", a monthly publication, is its official organ. <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">Orphanages</a> for girls, institutions for the aged and poor under the <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, night shelters for homeless girls under the Sisters of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> in connection with the Rescue Society, sisters who nurse the poor in their own homes, the Sisters of the Good Shepherd who seek to reclaim the fallen, Nazareth House, industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys under the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>, and Brothers of Mercy, and for girls under the Sisters of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>; all these manifest an untiring activity in ameliorating the lot of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, the forlorn, and the sick.
<h2>The Catholic federation and other organizations</h2>

<p>Drastic <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> legislation proposed by the government in 1906 and the imperative need for the organization of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> forces led to the formation of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Federation by Bishop Casartelli in 1906. Its primary object is the defence of purely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests, in which equality of treatment for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> largely predominates. The official organ is the "Catholic Federationist", which was first issued in Jan., 1910, and is used by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as a vehicle to convey his "message" on current questions.

<p>Other <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> are: a local branch of the <a href="../cathen/15077a.htm">Catholic Truth Society</a>, the parent <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of which was reorganized by <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a> when <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Salford in 1884; the School of Social Science; the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">Society of St. Vincent de Paul</a>; the Ladies of Charity; the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Needlework Guild; the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Boys' Brigade; the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Philharmonic Society; and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Women's League, with its notable offshoot "The Mothers' and Babes' Welcome".
