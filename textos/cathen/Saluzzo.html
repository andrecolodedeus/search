<h1>Saluzzo</h1>  

<p>(SALUCLIAE, SALUTIENSIS)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in the Province of <a href="../cathen/04569b.htm">Cuneo</a>, <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, Upper <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The city of Saluzzo is built on a hill overlooking a vast, well-cultivated plain. Iron, lead, silver, marble, slate, etc. are found in the surrounding mountains. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> (1480-1511), half-Gothic, contains a magnificent <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>, and is rich in <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Bernard, formerly belonging to the <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a>, has interesting <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the counts della Torre; the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Dominic contains several artistic <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a>, especially that of the Marquess Lodovico II and his spouse (1504), and the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Holy Sepulchre. St. Augustine's and St. Bernardino's are also worthy of note. The present town hall is the former <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a>, while the older one (1462), with a bold tower, is utilized by the Court of Assizes. It was the birthplace of <a href="../cathen/11609b.htm">Silvio Pellico</a>, typographer Bodoni, Abate Denina, and Malcarne the anatomist. Saluzzo was a town of the Vagienni, or mountain Liguri, and later of the Salluvii. This district was brought under Roman control by the Consul M. Fulvius. In the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> era it became the residence of a count; later, having passed to the marquesses of <a href="../cathen/14345a.htm">Susa</a>, Manfredo, son of Marquess Bonifacio del Vasto, on the division of that principality became Marquess of Saluzzo; this <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> held the marquisate from 1142 till 1548. The marquisate embraced the territory lying between the Alps, the Po, and the Stura, and was extended on several occasions. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> it had a chequered existence, often being in conflict with powerful neighbours, chiefly the Counts of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>.

<p>Tommaso III, a vassal of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, wrote the romance "Le chevalier errant". Ludovico (1416-75) was a wise and virtuous prince. Ludovico II constructed a tunnel, no longer in use, through the Monviso, a remarkable work for the time. With the help of the French he resisted a vigorous siege by the Duke of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> in 1486, but in 1487 yielded and retired to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> where he wrote "L'art de la chevalerie sous Veg&egrave;ce" (1488), a treatise on good government, and other works on military affairs. He was a patron of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and authors. In 1490 he regained power. After long struggles for independence, this small state was occupied (1548) by the French, as a fief of the Crown. In 1588 Carlo Emmanuele I of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> took possession of it. Thenceforward the city shared the destinies of <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a> with which it formed "one of the keys of the house" of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Saluzzo was formerly part of the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>. <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> in 1511 made it a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> immediately dependent on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Gianantonio della Rovere, who after eight months resigned in favour of his brother Sisto, later a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were: Filippo Archinti (1546), a celebrated jurisconsult; the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Antonio Picoth (1583) a learned and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> man, founder of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; he was succeeded by St. Giovenale Ancina (1597-1604) of the <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratory of St. Philip</a>, the apostle of <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>; Francesceo Agostino della Chiesa (1642); Carlo Gius. Morozzo (1698), who had built the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, since 1805, has been suffragan of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>; it contains 91 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with 170,000 inhabitants; 300 secular and 30 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular priests</a>; 31 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>; 4 institutes for boys and 3 for girls; and has a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> newspaper.
