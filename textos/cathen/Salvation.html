<h1>Salvation</h1>  

<p>(Greek <em>soteria</em>; Hebrew <em>yeshu'ah</em>).

<p><em>Salvation</em> has in Scriptural language the general meaning of liberation from straitened circumstances or from other evils, and of a translation into a state of freedom and security (<a href="../bible/1sa011.htm#vrs13">1 Samuel 11:13</a>; <a href="../bible/1sa014.htm#vrs45">14:45</a>; <a href="../bible/2sa023.htm#vrs10">2 Samuel 23:10</a>; <a href="../bible/2ki013.htm#vrs17">2 Kings 13:17</a>). At times it expresses <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel's</a> enemies, at other times, the Divine blessing bestowed on the produce of the soil (<a href="../bible/isa045.htm#vrs8">Isaiah 45:8</a>). As <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, being the root and source of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> uses the word "salvation" mainly in the sense of liberation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> or of individual man from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and its consequences. We shall first consider the salvation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, and then salvation as it is verified in the individual man.
<h2 id="section1">Salvation of the human race</h2>

<p>We need not dwell upon the possibility of the salvation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> or upon its appropriateness. Nor need we remind the reader that after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had freely determined to save the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, He might have done so by pardoning man's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> without having recourse to the Incarnation of the Second Person of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Most Holy Trinity</a>. Still, the Incarnation of the Word was the most fitting means for the salvation of man, and was even <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, in case <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> claimed full satisfaction for the injury done to him by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (see <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">INCARNATION</a>). Though the office of Saviour is really one, it is virtually multiple: there must be an atonement for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and damnation, an establishment of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> so as to overcome human <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, a perennial source of spiritual strength aiding man in his struggle against darkness and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. There can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> really fulfilled these three functions, that He therefore really saved <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and its consequences. As <em>teacher</em> He established the reign of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; as <em>king</em> He supplied strength to His subjects; as <em><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a></em> He stood between <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, reconciling <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> man with his angry <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.
<h3 id="A">Christ as teacher</h3>

<p>Prophets had foretold Christ as a teacher of Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: "Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, for a leader and a master to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>" (<a href="../bible/isa055.htm#vrs4">Isaiah 55:4</a>). Christ himself claims the title of teacher repeatedly during the course of His public life: "You can call me Master, and Lord; and you say well, for so I am" (<a href="../bible/joh013.htm#vrs13">John 13:13</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/mat023.htm#vrs10">Matthew 23:10</a>; <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs31">John 3:31</a>). The Gospels inform us that nearly the whole of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> public life was devoted to teaching (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">JESUS CHRIST</a>). There can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the supereminence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> teaching; even as man, He is an eyewitness to all He reveals; His truthfulness is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> own <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">veracity</a>; His authority is Divine; His words are the utterance of a Divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; He can internally illumine and move the minds of His hearers; He is the eternal and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Incarnate Who cannot deceive and cannot be deceived.
<h3 id="B">Christ as king</h3>

<p>The royal character of Christ was foretold by the Prophets, announced by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, claimed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself (<a href="../bible/psa002.htm#vrs6">Psalm 2:6</a>; <a href="../bible/isa009.htm#vrs6">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>; <a href="../bible/eze034.htm#vrs23">Ezekiel 34:23</a>; <a href="../bible/jer023.htm#vrs3">Jeremiah 23:3-5</a>; <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs32">Luke 1:32-33</a>; <a href="../bible/joh018.htm#vrs37">John 18:37</a>). His royal functions are the foundation, the expansion and the final consummation of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> among men. The first and last of these acts are personal and visible acts of the king, but the intermediate function is carried out either invisibly, or by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> visible agents. The practical working of the kingly office of Christ is described in the treatises on the sources of revelation; on grace, on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, on the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and on the <a href="../cathen/05528b.htm">last things</a>.
<h3 id="C">Christ as priest</h3>

<p>The ordinary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, is made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> own by an accidental unction, Christ is constituted <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> own Son by the substantial unction with the Divine nature; the ordinary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is made holy, though not impeccable, by his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, while Christ is separated from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and sinners by the <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a>; the ordinary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> draws nigh unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a very imperfect manner, but Christ is seated at the right hand of the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levitical</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> was temporal, earthly, and carnal in its origin, in its relations to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in its working, in its power; <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is eternal, heavenly, and spiritual. The victims offered by the ancient <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were either lifeless things or, at best, irrational animals distinct from the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the offerer; Christ offers a victim included in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the offerer. His living human flesh, animated by His rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, a real and worthy substitute for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, on whose behalf Christ offers the sacrifice. The Aaronic <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> inflicted an irreparable death on the victim which his sacrificial intention changed into a religious rite or symbol; in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sacrifice the immutation of the victim is brought about by an internal act of His will (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#vrs17">John 10:17</a>), and the victim's death is the source of a new life to himself and to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. Besides, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sacrifice, being that of a Divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, carries its own acceptance with it; it is as much of a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift of God</a> to man, as a sacrifice of man to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Hence follows the perfection of the salvation wrought by Christ for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. On His part Christ offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a satisfaction for man's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not only sufficient but superabundant (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs15">Romans 5:15-20</a>); on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> part supposing, what is contained in the very <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of man's <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> through Christ, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> agreed to accept the work of the Redeemer for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of man, He was bound by His promise and His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to grant the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to the extent and in the manner intended by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. In this way our salvation has won back for us the essential prerogative of the state of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, i.e., <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> while it will restore the minor prerogatives of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. At the same time, it does not at once blot out individual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but only procures the means thereto, and these means are not restricted only to the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> or to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, but extend to all men (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#vrs2">1 John 2:2</a>; <a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#vrs1">1 Timothy 2:1-4</a>). Moreover salvation makes us coheirs of Christ (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs14">Romans 8:14-17</a>), a royal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> (<a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#vrs9">1 Peter 2:9</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/exo019.htm#vrs6">Exodus 19:6</a>), sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> of the Holy Ghost (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#vrs16">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>), and other Christs--<em>Christianus alter Christus</em>; it perfects the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelical</a> orders, raises the dignity of the material world, and restores all things in Christ (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#vrs9">Ephesians 1:9-10</a>). By our salvation all things are ours, we are <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#vrs22">1 Corinthians 3:22-23</a>).
<h2 id="section2">Individual salvation</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> describes the process of salvation from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the case of an adult with great minuteness (Sess. VI, v-vi).

<p>It begins with the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm"><em>grace of God</em></a> which touches a sinner's heart, and calls him to repentance. This grace cannot be merited; it proceeds solely from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Man may receive or reject this inspiration of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he may turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or remain in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Grace does not constrain man's <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>.

<p>Thus assisted the sinner is <em>disposed for salvation</em> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; he believes in the revelation and promises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he fears <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, hopes in his mercy, trusts that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be merciful to him for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake, begins to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the source of all <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, hates and detests his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p>This disposition is followed by <em>justification</em> itself, which consists not in the mere remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but in the sanctification and renewal of the inner man by the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> reception of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, whence a man becomes just instead of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, a friend instead of a foe and so an heir according to hope of eternal life. This change happens either by reason of a perfect act of charity elicited by a well disposed sinner or by virtue of the Sacrament either of Baptism or of Penance according to the condition of the respective subject laden with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The Council further indicates the causes of this change. By the merit of the Most Holy Passion through the Holy Spirit, the charity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is shed abroad in the hearts of those who are justified.

<p>Against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> tenets of various times and <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> we must hold <ul> <li>that the initial grace is truly gratuitous and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>; <li>that the human will remains free under the influence of this grace; <li>that man really cooperates in his personal salvation from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; <li>that by justification man is really made just, and not merely declared or reputed so; <li>that justification and sanctification are only two aspects of the same thing, and not <a href="../cathen/11258a.htm">ontologically</a> and chronologically distinct realities; <li>that justification excludes all mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so that the just man is no way liable to the sentence of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> at <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> judgment-seat. </ul> Other points involved in the foregoing process of personal salvation from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are matters of discussion among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>; such are, for instance, <ul> <li>the precise nature of initial grace, <li>the manner in which grace and <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> work together, <li>the precise nature of the fear and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> disposing the sinner for justification, <li>the manner in which <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> cause <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. </ul>

<p>But these questions are treated in other articles dealing <em>ex professo</em> with the respective subjects. The same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of <a href="../cathen/11711a.htm">final perseverance</a> without which personal salvation from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not permanently secured.

<p>What has been said applies to the salvation of adults; children and those permanently deprived of their use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> are saved by the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Sacrament of Baptism</a>.
