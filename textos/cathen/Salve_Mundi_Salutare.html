<h1>Salve Mundi Salutare</h1>  

<p>A poem in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the various members of Christ on the Cross. A fifteenth-century <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> ascribes it to <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, and Daniel thinks that this "inspired singer of the Cross" could well have composed it. The commonest ascription is to <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>; and Trench thinks that this and other poems "were judged away from him on very slight and insufficient grounds by Mabillon", who places the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> among the spurious (<em>aliena et supposititia</em>) works of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> (P.L., CLXXXIV, 1319-24). Although the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> died in 1153, and no <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> antedates the fourteenth century, Daniel favours the ascription of two of the cantos to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. <a href="../cathen/10478b.htm">Mone</a> judged the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> of French origin, and declared that all hope of restoring the text correctly lay in the future discovery of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> This task was attempted by M. Haur&eacute;au ("Po&egrave;mes latins attribu&eacute;s &agrave; Saint Bernard", 1890, pp. 70-73), who, finding it in only three <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> (two in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, one at <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>), all of the fifteenth century, thinks it incredible that the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> should have been composed by St. Bernard.

<p>It is divided into seven cantos, headed respectively: "Ad Pedes", "Ad Genua", "Ad Manus", "Ad Latus", "Ad Pectus", "Ad Cor", "Ad Faciem" (To the Feet, Knees, Hands, Side, Breast, Heart, Face). Each canto contains five stanzas of ten lines each, except the canto "Ad Cor", which has seven. The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> give many variant texts and many additional titles (as "To the Mouth", "Shoulders", "Ears", "the Scourging", "the Crowning"). <a href="../cathen/10478b.htm">Mone</a> accepts only four cantos (To the Feet, Knees, Hand, Side) as original. Daniel accepts but two original cantos (those addressing the Feet and the Knees), but not their titles, which he believes of later <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a>. He thinks the oldest text is found in a Lichtenthal <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> (fifteenth century) containing only the cantos beginning "Salve mundi salutare" and "Salve, salve rex sanctorum", under the "probably <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>" title of "Planctus super passionem Domini". "Whoever," he says, "reads the first <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> carefully, must see that it concerns the whole form of Christ suffering, and that the feet are mentioned for the sole reason that the poet places himself at the foot of the cross, prostrate and embracing the feet of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>. The second poem, also, deals with the Passion generally, and only once, and passingly, alludes to the knees." He attributes both the titles and the elaborations to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, when the devotion to the <a href="../cathen/15714a.htm">Five Wounds</a> was growing. "Then the verses of Bernard offered convenient warps or threads in which might be interwoven the woof of devotion to the <a href="../cathen/15714a.htm">wounds</a> singly." The first lines of the cantos are: 1. Salve mundi salutare (Ad Pedes); 2. Salve Jesu, Rex sanctorum (Ad Genua); 3. Salve Jesu, paster bone (Ad Manus); 4. Salve Jesu, summe bonus (Ad Latus); 5. Salve, salus mea, Deus (Ad Pectus); 6. Summi regis cor aveto (Ad Cor); 7. Salve caput cruentatum (Ad Faciem).

<p>In St. Bernard's "Opuscula" (Venice, 1495), the seventh canto is addressed "To the Whole Body", and commences: "Salve Jesu reverende". Julian gives the first lines of some translations (by non-Catholics) of all the cantos except three and five, and remarks that "some of the parts have suffered from neglect", and that "this should be remedied by an able translator". In the second edition of the "Dict. of Hymnology", he refers to the translation of Mrs. E. M. Shapcote (a convert to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>) and gives the date as 1873. This was published first in the "Rosary Magazine" (1877 and 1878) and republished by Burns and Oates, London, 1879; its title is: "A Rhythmical <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> to the Sacred Members of Jesus Hanging upon the Cross".

<p>The stanzaic form is that used by Mrs. Shapcote in one of her latest works ("Mary, the Perfect Woman", Manresa Press, 1903), and may be illustrated by the first stanza of canto 5 (To the Breast):

<blockquote><p>O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of my Salvation, hail to Thee; <br>O <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, Sweetest Love, all hail to Thee; <br>O Venerable Breast, I worship Thee; <br>O Dwelling-place of Love, I fly to Thee, <br>With trembling touch adore and worship Thee. </p></blockquote>

<p>A different arrangement of the poem, found in Horst's "Paradisus animae christianae" (1644), has been translated by <a href="../cathen/11173a.htm">Canon Oakeley</a> (1850), and (probably) by W. J. Copeland. The first lines of both are given by Julian. The paucity of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> translations is doubtless due to the fact that the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> appears never to have been in <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> use. However, the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> "Jesu dulcis amor meus" (<a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15652a.htm">feast of the Most Holy Winding Sheet of Our Lord</a>, assigned to Friday after the second <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>) is made up of lines taken, with some alterations, from widely separated cantos. This short poem contains five stanzas of the type: "Jesu, dulcis amor meus" (l. 36); "Ac si praesens sis, accedo" (l. 6); "Te complector cum affectu' (l. 13); "Tuorum memor vulnerum" (l. 15). The following stanzas comprise lines 8, 97, (?), 65; 321 (Salve caput cruentatum), 326, 328, 330; 156 (Salve latus Salvatoris), 166, 169, 170; 106, 116, (?), 40. This curiously constructed <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> (the lines are here numbered as they are found in P.L., loc. cit.) has neither rhyme nor classical quantity, while the fourth line of each stanza is in iambic rhythm and the other three lines are in trochaic rhythm. Three translations are indicated below.

KONIGSFELD, Lateinische Hymnen und Gesange (Bonn, 1865), 190-201, gives twelve stanzas with German tr.; MARCH, Latin Hymns (NewYork, 1875), 144-119, gives fifteen stanzas (with notes, p. 277). The hymn Jesu dulcis amor meus, tr. CASWALL, in Lyra Catholica (1849); latest ed. 1884); tr. WALLACE, 1874; tr. BAGSHAWE in Breviary Hymns and Missal Sequences (London, 1900), 75.</p></div>
