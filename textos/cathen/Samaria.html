<h1>Samaria</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a>, suffragan of C&aelig;sarea in Palestine Prima. In the sixth year of his reign (about 900 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>) Amri, King of Israel, laid the foundations of the city to which he gave the name of Samaria, "after the name of Semer the owner of the hill" (<a href="../bible/2sa016.htm#vrs24">2 Samuel 16:24</a>). This detached hill was 1454 feet above sea-level, and more than 328 feet above the surrounding hills. His son, Achab, married to <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a>, a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Sidonian princess, introduced the worship of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> (<a href="../bible/1ki016.htm#vrs32">1 Kings 16:32</a>). Shortly after, the Prophet Elias announced the famine which for three years and more devastated the city and surrounding country (<a href="../bible/1ki017.htm#vrs18">1 Kings 17:18</a>). Samaria suffered her first siege from Benadad, King of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> (<a href="../bible/1ki020.htm#vrs1">1 Kings 20:1-21</a>); after the disaster which this same king suffered at Aphec, he concluded a treaty with Achab (<a href="../bible/1ki020.htm#vrs34">1 Kings 20:34-43</a>). The body of Achab was carried there from Ramoth Galaad, and the dogs licked his blood in the gutters, according to the prediction of the Prophet (<a href="../bible/1ki022.htm#vrs1">1 Kings 22:1-39</a>). Elias prophesied that King Ochonias, who fell from the window of his palace, would die of this fall, which prophecy was very shortly fulfilled (<a href="../bible/2ki001.htm">2 Kings 1</a>). His brother and successor, Joram, threw down the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, erected by Achab (<a href="../bible/2ki003.htm#vrs2">2 Kings 3:2</a>). The history of Samaria is connected with various episodes in the life of the Prophet Elias, notably on account of the siege of the city by Benadad (<a href="../bible/2ki002.htm#vrs25">2 Kings 2:25</a>; 6:8 sq.). Jehu, founder of a new dynasty, exterminated the last descendants of Achab, and destroyed the temple of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> in Samaria; then he was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the city as his predecessors had been (<a href="../bible/2ki010.htm">2 Kings 10</a>). Nevertheless the worship of Astarte still continued in the city (<a href="../bible/2ki013.htm#vrs6">2 Kings 13:6</a>). Joas, who had transported the treasures of the temple of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, pillaged by him, to Samaria, was buried in the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> (<a href="../bible/2ki014.htm#vrs14">2 Kings 14:14-16</a>; <a href="../bible/2ch025.htm#vrs24">2 Chronicles 25:24</a>) as also was his son Jeroboam II (<a href="../bible/2ki014.htm#vrs16">2 Kings 14:16, 24, 29</a>). Then followed a series of regicides and changing of ruling <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. Zachary, after reigning six months, was assassinated (<a href="../bible/2ki015.htm#vrs10">2 Kings 15:10</a>) by Sellum, who reigned one month, and was in turn killed by Manahem, who ruled ten years (<a href="../bible/2ki015.htm#vrs14">2 Kings 15:14-17</a>). His son, Phaceia, after a reign of two years, was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by the chief of his army, Phacee (<a href="../bible/2ki015.htm#vrs25">2 Kings 15:25</a>), who met a like fate at the end of twenty years (<a href="../bible/2ki015.htm#vrs30">2 Kings 15:30</a>). Osee, son of Ella, seems to have been <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> or placed upon the throne by Teglathphalasar III, King of Assyria. Finally Salmanasar IV and his general, Sargon, took possession of Samaria (721 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>) after a siege lasting not less than three years (<a href="../bible/2ki017.htm#vrs4">2 Kings 17:4-6</a>; <a href="../bible/2ki018.htm#vrs9">18:9</a> sq.). The inhabitants who survived the siege were transported into <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a> to the number of 27,290, according to an inscription. Thus were realized the threats of the Prophets against haughty Samaria (<a href="../bible/isa009.htm#vrs9">Isaiah 9:9-11</a>; <a href="../bible/isa028.htm#vrs1">28:1-8</a>; <a href="../bible/eze023.htm#vrs4">Ezekiel 23:4-9</a>; <a href="../bible/hos007.htm">Hosea 7</a>, <a href="../bible/hos008.htm">8</a>, <a href="../bible/hos010.htm">10</a>, <a href="../bible/hos014.htm">14</a>; <a href="../bible/amo003.htm#vrs9">Amos 3:9-15</a>; <a href="../bible/amo004.htm#vrs1">4:1 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/amo006.htm#vrs1">6:1</a>; <a href="../bible/amo007.htm#vrs2">7:2-17</a>; <a href="../bible/amo008.htm#vrs14">8:14</a>; <a href="../bible/mic001.htm#vrs5">Micah 1:5-7</a>; <a href="../bible/mic002.htm">2</a>; <a href="../bible/mic003.htm">3</a>; <a href="../bible/mic006.htm">6</a>; <a href="../bible/psa008.htm#vrs4">Psalm 8:4</a> etc.).

<p>The first historical period, and not the least glorious, since it was for nearly two hundred years the capital of the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, was thus ended. There remained only the temple of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, which had preceded the temple of <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>, erected by <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">King Herod</a>, repaired by the American mission of Harvard University, also the palace of Amri, discovered by this same mission. Instead of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> transported into <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a>, colonies were sent over, formed of various nations, Chaldeans, Cutheans, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a>, <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, and others (<a href="../bible/2ki017.htm#vrs24">2 Kings 17:24</a>); these mingled with the native population, forming an amalgamation of religion and <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>; thus the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> with their own national worship gave birth to the people and the religion of the Samaritans. The latter became furious enemies of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but Sichem or Neapolia, and not Samaria, became their principal religious and political centre. From 721-355 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>, Samaria was a <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> and Persian city; finally it fell into the power of Alexander who to avenge the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of his governor, partly exterminated the inhabitants, replacing them by a Gr&aelig;co-Syrian colony (Quintus Curtius, IV, 321). Having thus become Gr&aelig;co- Samaritan, the city continued its hostilities against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and following an attack upon Marissa, it was taken after a memorable siege and utterly destroyed by John Hyrcanus about 110 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>. It was rebuilt by the proconsul of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Gabinus, between 57 and 55 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> (Josephus, "Bell. Jud.", I, vii, 7; I, viii, 4; "Ant.", XIII, x, 2, 3; XIV, v, 3). The city was then returned to the Samaritans. <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod the Great</a> eventually received it from Octavius (31 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>) after the death of Cleopatra, the previous ruler. He enlarged and embellished it, in the centre built a magnificent temple to <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> (of which the monumental staircase may still be seen), and called it Sebaste (about 25 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>) in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the sovereign (Josephus, "Bell. Jud.", I, xx, 3; I, xxi, 2; "Ant.", XV, vii, 3; XV, viii, 5). <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> made it one of his favourite residences, although it was maritime C&aelig;sarea which obtained his political preponderance. After <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> came his son <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#II">Archelaus</a>, who ruled the city ("Ant.", XVII, xi, 4; "Bell. Jud.", II, vi, 3); at the death of the latter the province was annexed to <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> as a gift to <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#IV">Herod Agrippa I</a>, <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 41 ("Ant.", XIX, v, 1; XIX, ix, 1-2). Always hostile to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the inhabitants of Samaria saw their city burned by the latter, <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 65 ("Bell. Jud.", II, xviii, 1); according to Ulpianus, "Digest", L, tit. 15, and the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a> of the city, Septimus Severus established there a colony about <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 200 (<a href="../cathen/05274b.htm">Eckhel</a>, "Doctrina numm.", III, 44). Very likely a Roman garrison was then placed there.

<p>It is possible that there may have been some question of Samaria in <a href="../bible/act008.htm">Acts 8:5</a>, on the subject of the sermon of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Philip; in this case <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is traced to its very origins. According to <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> (Oriens christ., III, 649-54), Marinus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13667a.htm">Sebaste</a>, represented the diocese at the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> (325); Eusebius at <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a> (359); Priscianus at Constantinople (381); Eleutherius at <a href="../cathen/09468b.htm">Lydda</a> (Lydia), (415); Constantine at the <a href="../cathen/05495a.htm">Robber Synod of Ephesus</a> (449); Marcianus, at the end of the fifth century; Pelagius (535). During the French occupation Samaria was a Latin <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, and several titulary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are mentioned (Eubel, "Hierarchia Catholica medii &aelig;vi", I, 445; II, 309). The Greeks also made it a <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a>. It must be remembered that <a href="../cathen/13667a.htm">Sebaste</a> and not Samaria was always the correct name of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. From the fourth century we meet with the cultus of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> at Samaria; it possessed also the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of Eliseus and Abdias, and that of St. John the Baptist, whose magnificent church, rebuilt by the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a>, is today a mosque (see text in Thomson, "Sacred Places", I, 102). From 985, El-Muqadassi does not mention Samaria, now nothing more than a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> district of Nablusi; in 1283, we find nothing but one inhabited house with the exception of a little Greek <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (Burchard, "Descriptio Terr&aelig; Sanct&aelig;", Leipzig, 1873, 53). Today the village of Sebastyeh, amid orchards and kitchen gardens, comprises three hundred inhabitants, all <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>.
