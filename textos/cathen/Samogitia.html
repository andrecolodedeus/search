<h1>Samogitia</h1>  

<p>(SAMOGITIENSIS)

<p>A Russian diocese, also called Telshi (Telshe), including the part of <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a> lying on the Baltic; this Lithuanian district, also named Schmudien (Polish, Zmudz) or Schamaiten (Lithuanian, Zemaitis), was conquered about 1380 by the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a>, and ceded to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> in 1411 by the first Treaty of Thorn after the defeat of Tannenberg. During the supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a> a part of the inhabitants had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, but <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had not become firmly established. King Jagello of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> (1386-1434) travelled through the country, gave instruction in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> himself, and called upon the people to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. He founded the Diocese of Samogitia with its see at Miedniki, his act being confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> in 1416, and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which was dedicated to Saints Alexander, Evantius, and Theodul, was erected in 1417. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was a German named Matthias; he was succeeded in 1421 by Nicholas, a <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Pole</a>. Until the sixteenth century a large part of the people were strongly inclined to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a>. Among the later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should be mentioned Melchior I (1574-1609), who re-established <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> after the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. His predecessor George III founded a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. There was an uninterrupted succession of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> until 1778. The see then remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a>, and in 1798 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was suppressed, after it had fallen to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> in the third Partition of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> in 1795. Up to that time it had been a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>. In 1849 it was re-established as a suffragan of Mohilev. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of this second period was Matthias Wolonzewski. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is Kovno on the Njemen. By the convention made in 1847 between <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> and <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> the diocese includes the governments of Courland and Kovno, which have together an area of about 26,219 square miles. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the two governments is 1,258,092; there are 426 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and dependent stations, and 600 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.
