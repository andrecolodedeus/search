<h1>Samson</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Edmunds, b. at Tottington, near Thetford, in 1135; d. 1211. After taking his M.A. in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Samson returned to Norfolk and taught in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/03085a.htm">Bury</a>. In 1160 the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of St. Edmunds sent him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on their behalf to appeal against an agreement of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and King Henry II, and for this on his return Abbot Hugh promptly clapped him into gaol. In 1166 Samson was a fully-professed <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, and on his election as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> on Hugh's death in 1182 he had filled a number of offices &mdash; those of sub-sacrist, guestmaster, pittancer, third prior, master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, and master of the workmen. For the rest of his life, as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Edmunds, Samson worked with prodigious activity for the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, for the town, and for the State. He regained the right of joint election of two bailiffs for the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and town, made a thorough investigation of the properties of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, looked into the finances, cleared off arrears of <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>, rebuilt the choir, constructed an aqueduct, and added the great bell tower at the west end of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and two flanking towers. He did his best for the liberties of the town; helped the townsfolk to obtain a charter and gave every encouragement to new settlers. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> resisted Samson's concessions of market <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to the townsmen, but were no match for their <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. A <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at Babwell, and a free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for poor scholars, were also the gifts of Abbot Samson to the townspeople. Pope Lucius III made Samson a judge delegate in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> causes; he served on the commission for settling the quarrel between Archbishop Hubert and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>; and on the Royal Council in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, where he sat as a baron, frustrated the efforts of William of Longchamp to curtail the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>. Samson died in 1211, having ruled his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> successfully for thirty years. Carlyle in "Past and Present" has made Abbot Samson familiar to all the world; but Carlyle's fascinating picture must not be mistaken for history.
