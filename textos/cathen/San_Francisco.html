<h1>San Francisco</h1>  

<p>(SANCTI FRANCISCI)

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> established 29 July 1853 to include the Counties of San Francisco, San Mateo, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Sonoma, Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Lake, Mendocino, Napa, Salano, and Merced lying north of 37&#176; 5' N. lat. in the <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">State of California</a>, U.S.A.; an area of 16,856 square miles. Its suffragans are: the <a href="../cathen/10532a.htm">Diocese of Monterey and Los Angeles</a>, and the Diocese of Sacramento, in <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/13404c.htm">Diocese of Salt Lake</a>, which comprises the <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">State of Utah</a> and six counties of the <a href="../cathen/10775a.htm">State of Nevada</a>. the province including the states of <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> and Nevada and all the territory east to the Rio Colorado.

<p>All <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> &#151; Lower, or Old <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, and Upper, or the present state &#151; was originally under Spanish and Mexican <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and later formed the Diocese of Both Californias, of which the Right Reverend Francisco Garcia Diego y Moreno was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> who landed with <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Cortes</a> at Santa Cruz Bay on 3 May, 1535 began the first mission work, under the leadership of Father Martin de la Coruna. Their labors in this field, and those of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> who followed them half a century later, are detailed in a special article devoted to that topic (see <a href="../cathen/03177b.htm">CALIFORNIA MISSIONS</a>). Portola discovered the present San Francisco Bay 1 Nov., 1769, and as one of the chain of missions projected by <a href="../cathen/13730b.htm">Father Junipero Serra</a>, the mission of San Francisco de Asis, called also the Mission Dolores, was founded 9 Oct., 1776 by his two <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> brethren Fathers <a href="../cathen/11434a.htm">Francisco Palou</a> and Benito Cambon, both natives of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Under the fostering care of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> the mission prospered without interruption for more than half a century. Then came the secularization and plunder of the <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> missions by the <a href="../cathen/10250b.htm">Mexican</a> Government in 1834, and San Francisco suffered ruin with the others. The village of Yerba Buena was established on its site, and colonization invited by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>. Some outside trading was done, and a few ships entered the harbour. In the midsummer of 1846, a man-of-war took possession of the place in the name of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, and on 30 Jan. of the following year the name of the town Yerba Buena was changed to San Francisco. Gold was discovered in the spring of 1848, and with this came the thousands of fortune-hunters of all nations and the beginning of the city as a great centre of commerce (see <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">CALIFORNIA</a>).

<p>Previous to this the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> had established the Diocese of Both Californias, suffragan to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Mexico, and appointed as its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, on 27 April, 1840, Father Francis Garcia Diego y Moreno, who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/15740a.htm">Zacatecas</a>, 4 Oct., 1840. He was born at Lagos, State of Jalisco, Mexico, 17 Sept., 1785, and joined the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> at the age of seventeen. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 13 Nov., 1808 he was successively master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> and vicar of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Our Lady of Guadalupe, and laboured <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> giving missions in the towns and cities of Mexico. In 1830 he was appointed Prefect of the Missions for the Conversion of the Indians in <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, and set out for this new field with ten missionaries from the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Our Lady of Guadalupe, reaching Santa Clara, where he took up his residence. The missions of Upper <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> were then in a very demoralized state, owing to secular and political interference and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Their utter ruin was averted by the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of these <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> until the passage of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of secularization by the Mexican Congress in August, 1834. The destruction that followed this was so widespread that in the summer of 1836 he went back to Mexico, and by a persistent appeal to its congress secured the repeal of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of secularization and an order for the restoration of the missions to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Business in connection with his order detained him in Mexico for several years, and then as he was about to return to <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> he received notice of his appointment as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the newly-created diocese which contained eighteen of the twenty-one historic <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> missions. Most of them were in ruins when he arrived at San Diego on 11 December, 1841, to commence the disheartening task of saving what he could of the wreck left by the plunderers of the era of secularization. By heroic effort he opened a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Santa Ynez 4 May, 1844, and by word, deed, and example did everything possible to re-establish the missions, but his health failed, and returning to Santa Barbara in January, 1842 he died there 13 April, 1846.

<p>Very Rev. Jos&eacute; Maria Gonzalez Rubio, O.F.M., the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, was appointed administrator before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> died, and the choice was ratified by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Mexico. The condition of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> may be seen from the statement of the administrator made in a circular letter <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 30 May, 1848, and addressed to the people. "Day by day" he said, "we see that our circumstances grow in difficulty; that helps and resources have shrunk to almost nothing; that the hope of supplying the needed <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> is now almost extinguished; and worst of all that through lack of means and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> Divine worship throughout the whole diocese stands upon the brink of total ruin." The date of this letter is the same as that on which the Treaty of Queretar was signed, ceding <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.
<h2>American rule</h2>

<p>When Upper <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> thus became part of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10250b.htm">Mexican</a> Government refused to permit an American <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to exercise <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in Lower California. To meet his difficulty <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a> detached the Mexican territory from the Diocese of San Diego or Monterey, which had been erected by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a> 27 April, 1840, and by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Sacred Congregation of Propaganda</a>, 1 July, 1854, divided Upper <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> into the two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of San Francisco and Monterey. By <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 29 July, San Francisco was made an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, with Monterey its suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. As <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of San Diego or Monterey, the <a href="../cathen/01282a.htm">Reverend Joseph Sadoc Alemany, O.P.</a> had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Cardinal Fransoni 30 June, 1850. He was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of San Francisco, and took possession 29 July, 1853. Before all this occurred, Father Gonzalez as administrator began to take measures to provide for the needs of the people, and in a circular appeal for aid, dated Santa Barbara, 13 June, 1849, he tells his flock that he has asked for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary and from the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>.



<p>In the autumn of 1849 Father John Brouillet, then <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of Nesqually, <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, landed at San Francisco on a visit, and as he was the only <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the vicinity who could speak English, the spiritual destitution of the thousands about the town trying to reach the newly-discovered gold fields touched him, and he remained there to minister to them. A few months later Father Antoine* Langlois, a <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a> who had been labouring for six years in the north-west and was then on his way to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> to enter the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, joined him, and by direction of his superiors also remained at San Francisco. He has left an "Ecclesiastical and Religious Journal for San Francisco" in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, which is preserved at Santa Clara College, and in this he relates: "The first Mass said in the Mission established in the city of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> [sic] was on June 17th, 1849, the third <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> after Pentecost; Father Brouillet . . . was specifically charged to yield to the wishes of the people and labour towards the building of a Church and hold divine service therein. A beginning was made by the purchase of a piece of ground 25 by 50 varas, after he had called the more <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> together and opened a subscription of $5000 to pay for the lot and the building to be erected on it . . . Religion now began to be practised in spite of the natural obstacles then in its way by the thirst of gold".

<p>Father Brouillet then returned to <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, and to succeed him in the mission Fathers Michael Accolti and John Nobili, S.J. reached San Francisco from <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a> 8 Dec., 1849 to establish in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, in response to the invitation of the administrator, a house and college of their order either at <a href="../cathen/10532a.htm">Los Angeles</a> or San Jos&eacute;, the latter being at that time the chief city of Northern <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>. These two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> played a very prominent part in the subsequent development of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the diocese. Father Accolti tried to obtain assistance from his brethren of the Missouri and other provinces of his order, and finally in May, 1854 succeeded in having the <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> mission adopted by the Province of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In May, 1852 Father James Ryder, S.J., of the <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> Province visited San Francisco and remained four months on business connected with the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. In March, 1850 two fathers of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary arrived from the <a href="../cathen/13438a.htm">Sandwich Islands</a>, and shortly after four others of the same Congregation from Valparaiso. They were immediately invited to establish themselves in the old missions in Southern <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> and only one of them remained at San Francisco. This was Father Flavian Fontaine, who started a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> there, as he spoke English fluently. This <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> failed after some time, and occasioned much trouble owing to the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a> he left on the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, which were assumed by Father Nobili, who undertook to continue the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> as an adjunct to Santa Clara College which he had founded near San Jos&eacute;. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, represented by Father Anderson, were also established. He received faculties from the administrator 17 Sept., 1850 and was appointed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> at Sacramento, where he fell a victim to cholera early the following year. The "Catholic Directory" for 1850 has this report from <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>: "The number of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a> in Northern <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> is about sixteen, two of whom, the Rev. John B. Brouillet and Rev. Antoine* Langlois, are in the town of San Francisco, where a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was dedicated to Divine worship last June. The reverend <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> there have also made arrangements for the opening of a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the instruction of children. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is variously estimated at from fifteen to twenty thousand".

<p>Racial differences had made some trouble which the administrator hoped the advent of the English-speaking <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> would help to settle. In a letter to Father Accolti from Santa Barbara on 5 March, 1850, he says: "Strangers have not been wanting, who, despising the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the country, have desired to build a church apart, and have it attended by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of their own tongue. Such pretensions, though based on some specious reasons, have to some of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> savoured of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>".

<p>Such were the conditions in the new diocese to which <a href="../cathen/01282a.htm">Bishop Alemany</a> was appointed. He was born at <a href="../cathen/15405a.htm">Vich</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 13 July, 1814, entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> in 1829, and in the following year, driven from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> by government <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, he went with a fellow <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> Francis Sadoc Villarasa to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where they continued their studies and were <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> on 27 March, 1837, at <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>. They applied to be sent to the Philippine mission, but were assigned instead to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, where <a href="../cathen/01282a.htm">Father Alemany</a> became Provincial of St. Joseph's Province of the order. Ten years were spent in missionary work in <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14508a.htm">Tennessee</a>, during which time they learned to speak and write English fluently. After <a href="../cathen/01282a.htm">Bishop Alemany's</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> he remained in R+ome for a short time, and then, on his way back to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, he stopped at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he collected some gifts of much-needed church furnishings, and in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, where he arranged for volunteer teachers for his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for his people. He finally reached San Francisco on the night of 6 Dec., 1850, accompanied by Father Villarasa, O.P., and Sister Mary Goemare, a religious of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> sisterhood. Father Villarasa was for forty years subsequently commissary general of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> in <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, and died there in 1888. They found at San Francisco only two churches: St. Francis's, a frame building attended by those who did not speak Spanish, and the old Mission Dolores for those who did. At Monterey the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> established the first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> in <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> and St. Catherine's Academy, where he and Father Villarasa taught until the arrival of Mother Louisa O'Neill and a band of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. The first English-speaking student to enter the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> there in 1852 was Thomas O'Neill, b. in 1832 at Dungannon, Co. Tyrone, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> he spent more than fifty years in missionary work in the houses of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> in <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/01282a.htm">Bishop Alemany</a> devoted much time to meeting the many difficulties which the differences of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and forms held by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of English-speaking countries from those reared under the Spanish system occasioned. In this he was aided by several pioneer <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, notably the Rev. John Shanahan, who, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> at Mt. St. Mary's, Emmitsburg, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> in 1823, after working many years in New York had gone out to <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> with the gold-seekers; Rev. Eugene O'Connell, and Rev. John McGinnis. Father O'Connell was born 18 June, 1815 in Co. Meath, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1842. When <a href="../cathen/01282a.htm">Bishop Alemany</a> visited <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> on his way home from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he persuaded Father O'Connell, who was then a professor in All Hallows College, to come out to San Francisco and direct the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> which he opened at once at Santa Inez. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> attended the first Plenary Council at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> in May, 1852, and he was thus able to report substantial progress in his charge, with foundations of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, Fathers of the Sacred Hearts, Sisters of Notre Dame, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Sisters of St. Dominic</a>, 31 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 38 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and an estimated <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 40,000. A band of Sisters of Charity from Emmitsburg, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> arrived in August, 1852, and began their work in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. On 7 July, 1853 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> laid the cornerstone of St. Mary's Church, San Francisco, and having been notified of his elevation to the newly-created Archbishopric of San Francisco formally assumed the title 29 July, 1853. In order to obtain more <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and religious he sent Father Hugh P. Gallagher, who had gone to San Francisco from <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, Penn., to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, where he succeeded in securing two bands of Presentation Nuns and <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, who arrived at San Francisco 15 Nov., 1854. The <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> came from Kinsale, Co. <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>, and were led by the famous Mother Mary Baptist (Kate Russell) sister of Lord Russell of Killowen. After a life full of great utility, she died in Aug., 1898 at St. Mary's Hospital, San Francisco, which she founded and directed for more than forty years. Father Gallagher, who had edited a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper at <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, took up that work also in san Francisco, where he directed its first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> weekly, the "Catholic Standard". He was for many years <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Mary's Cathedral. Among other pioneer <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should be mentioned Fathers John Ingoldsby, John Quinn, John McGinnis, Patrick Mackin, William Kenny, Richard Carroll, who was head of the Diocesan Seminary of St. Thomas Acquinas, Jame Croke, for a long period <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, Peter Grey, and John Prendergast, also <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>.

<p>Progress was manifest in the rural sections, churches also springing up at Sacramento, Weaverville, Marysville, Grass Valley, Stockton, Placerville, San Mateo, Dalton, and Nevada. A <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Father Kian, was even present (1854) for the benefit of his fellow-countrymen. The titles to the old mission <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> were also secured by legal action. In 1858 the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and on 15 July, 1862 convened the first <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod, which was attended by forty-four <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. At this the decrees of the Baltimore Council were <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, and rules prescribed for the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The year before the increase of churches in the northern section of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> prompted the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to establish there a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicariate Apostolic</a> of Marysville and the Rev. Eugene O'Connell was appointed to take charge. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06099c.htm">Flaviopolis</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Marysville, 3 Feb., 1861, in All Hallows College, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. He reached Marysville 8 June, and was inducted on the following day at St. Joseph's Pro-cathedral by <a href="../cathen/01282a.htm">Archbishop Alemany</a>. He had only four <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in his vicariate, which included the territory from 39x to 40x N. lat. and from the Pacific Coast to the eastern boundary of <a href="../cathen/10775a.htm">Nevada</a>. In 1868 the vicariate was erected into the Diocese of Grass Valley, and Bishop O'Connell was transferred to this title 3 Feb. of that year. On 28 May, 1884, the Diocese of Sacramento was created out of this Grass Valley district, with the addition of ten counties in <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> and one in <a href="../cathen/10775a.htm">Nevada</a>, and Bishop O'Connell ruled it until 17 March, 1884, when he resigned and was made <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Joppa. He died at Lost Angeles 4 Dec., 1891.

<p>The succeeding decades gave no respite to the activity and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of <a href="../cathen/01282a.htm">Archbishop Alemany</a> in furthering the progress of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the weight of years and the stress of his long but willing toil began to tell on him. He asked for a coadjutor, and the Rev. Patrick William Riordan, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. James's Church, <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, was selected by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for the office. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cabesa and coadjutor of San Francisco with <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">succession</a>, 16 Sept., 1883. <a href="../cathen/01282a.htm">Archbishop Alemany</a> resigned the title of San Francisco 28 Dec., 1884 and retired to his native <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where he d. 14 April, 1888 at Valencia. When he resigned the diocese had 131 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 182 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 6 colleges, 18 academies, 5 asylums, 4 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of about 220,000.

<p>Archbishop Patrick William Riordan, who immediately succeeded him, was born 27 Aug., 1841, at <a href="../cathen/03642a.htm">Chatham</a>, New Brunswick. His early studies were made at Notre Dame University, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, whence he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as one of the twelve students who formed the first class that opened the North American College, 7 Dec., 1859. From there he went to the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>, and received the degree of S.T.D. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, 10 June, 1865 and returning to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was appointed professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the Seminary of St. Mary of the Lake, <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>. Later he served as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> at Joliet, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>. At the outset of his administration he made the cause of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> his special endeavour. There had been two earlier attempts to carry on a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. One had failed for lack of teachers, the other for want of pupils. In 1884 Archbishop Riordan made an appeal for a new <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and Mrs. Kate Johnson gave him 80 acres of fine land at Menlo Park. Here St. Patrick's Seminary, a large and elaborate building was erected and he gave its management to the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>. In Aug., 1887 he encouraged the Religious of the Sacred Heart who had come into the diocese in 1882, to begin their academy in the city and develop it into the flourishing institute that was transferred to Menlo Park in August, 1898. The <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a> in 1889 moved their St. Mary's College from Bernal Heights to Oakland. The college was started by the Reverend James Croke, V.G., in 1863, and for five years was managed by <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. In 1868 seven <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">Brothers</a> from New York under Brother Justin took over the care of the college, which was chartered by the State in 1872. The Brothers also started their Sacred Heart College in 1878.

<p>Archbishop Riordan brought in the <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesian Fathers</a> to take care of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> in 1888, Father O. Franchi, a <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a>, being the first to arrive. In 1893 they were also given charge of the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> colony in Oakland. The <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulist</a> Congregation of New York were also invited into the diocese and given charge of Old St. Mary's Church. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> took up the claim on Mexico for the arrears of the <a href="../cathen/12106a.htm">Pious Fund of the Californias</a> due the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and prosecuted it to a successful issue before the International Arbitration Tribunal at the <a href="../cathen/07108a.htm">Hague</a>, where it was the first case tried. He was a delegate to the Hague in 1902. The <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> were given charge of the scattered missions along the coast of Mendocino in August, 1903. In 1905 the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> presided over the golden jubilee of St. Ignatius's College and Church, which had been founded at San Francisco in 1855 by Father Anthony Maraschi, S.J.

<p>As his health failed Archbishop Riordan requested the appointment of a coadjutor, and the Right Rev. George Montgomery, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10532a.htm">Monterey and Los Angeles</a>, was elevated to the titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishopric</a> of Osino and made his coadjutor in January, 1903. He was born in Davies County, <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, 30 Dec., 1847, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> 20 Dec., 1879. He was chancellor of the Archdiocese of San Francisco when he was chosen for the See of Monterey, in which diocese his administration was most successful, especially in defending the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indians. He had just settled down as Archbishop Riordan's assistant, and that <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> had started on a tour for recuperation, when San Francisco was visited by the terrible calamity of the earthquake of 18 April, 1906, and its subsequent fire. Twelve churches were burned and their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> absolutely wiped out of existence. In the burned district, along with the churches all the institutions, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, asylums, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, the great <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> church and College of St. Ignatius, and the Sacred Heart College of the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> &#151; were destroyed. Four churches in the city were wrecked by the earthquake, and others, including the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and St. Patrick's Seminary at Menlo Park, more or less damaged. Happily no lives of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, religious, or of children in their care were sacrificed. Archbishop Montgomery took a prominent and very active part in the rescue work that began at once, and Archbishop Riordan returned to the city and commenced the gigantic task of restoration which was rapidly accomplished in two or three years, aided by the generosity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> congregations of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, who sent more than $300,000 at once to the stricken diocese; this great exertion, however, had a debilitating effect on Archbishop Montgomery, who d. 10 Jan., 1907. (see <a href="../cathen/10532a.htm">DIOCESE OF MONTEREY AND LOS ANGELES</a>).

<p>On 24 Dec., 1908 Bishop Denis J. O'Connell was appointed auxiliary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of San Francisco. Bishop O'Connell was born at Donoughmore, Co. <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 28 Jan., 1849, and made his studies at the American College, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> he carried the decrees of the last <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and returned as secretary to Bishop Conroy, ablegate to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. He was made a domestic <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> 20 March, 1887, and <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the American College, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, after the death of Mgr. Hostlot in 1884, and held that office until July, 1895, when he resigned, and acted as the vicar of Cardinal Gibbons for his titular church, S. Maria in Trastevere, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was appointed <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the Catholic University, Washington, in 1903; on 3 May, 1908 was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13667a.htm">Sebaste</a>; and on 24 Dec., 1908 was appointed auxiliary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of San Francisco. On 19 Jan., 1912 he was transferred from San Francisco to <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>, <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>, as successor to Bishop van de Vyver.
