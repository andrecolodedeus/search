<h1>Sanctifying Grace</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> (<em>gratia, Charis</em>), in general, is a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift of God</a> to <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> creatures (men, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>) for their <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, whether the latter be furthered and attained through salutary acts or a state of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Eternal <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> itself consists in heavenly bliss resulting from the <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuitive</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Triune God</a>, who to the one not endowed with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> "inhabiteth light inaccessible" (<a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#vrs16">1 Timothy 6:16</a>). <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Christian grace</a> is a fundamental <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, the pillar on which, by a special <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the majestic edifice of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> rests in its entirety. Among the three fundamental <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> &#151; <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> &#151; <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> plays the part of the means, indispensable and Divinely <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, to effect the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through Christ and to lead men to their eternal destiny in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p>Before the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a> seldom used the term <em>gratia actualis</em>, preferring <em>auxilium speciale</em>, <em>motio divina</em>, and similar designations; nor did they formally distinguish <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a> from sanctifying grace. But, in consequence of modern <a href="../cathen/06710a.htm">controversies regarding grace</a>, it has become usual and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> to draw a sharper distinction between the transient help to act (actual grace) and the permanent state of grace (sanctifying grace). For this reason we adopt this distinction as our principle of division in our exposition of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>. In this article, we shall treat only of sanctifying grace. (See also <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">ACTUAL GRACE.</a>)

<p><em>Santifying grace</em>

<p>Since the end and aim of all efficacious grace is directed to the production of sanctifying grace where it does not already exist, or to retain and increase it where it is already present, its excellence, dignity, and importance become immediately apparent; for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and the sonship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> depend solely upon the possession of sanctifying grace, wherefore it is frequently called simply <em>grace</em> without any qualifying word to accompany it as, for instance, in the phrases "to live in grace" or "to fall from grace".

<p>All pertinent questions group themselves around three points of view from which the subject may be considered: <blockquote> I. The preparation for sanctifying grace, or the process of justification. <br>II. The nature of sanctifying grace. <br>III. The characteristics of sanctifying grace. </blockquote>
<h2 id="section1">Justification: the preparation for sanctifying grace</h2>

<p>(For an exhaustive treatment of justification, see the article <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">JUSTIFICATION</a>).

<p>The word <em>justification</em> (<em>justificatio</em>, from <em>justum facere</em>) derives its name from <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> (<em>justitia</em>), by which is not merely meant the cardinal virtue in the sense of a constant purpose to respect the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of others (<em>suum cuique</em>), nor is the term taken in the concept of all those virtues which go to make up the moral law, but connotes, especially, the whole inner relation of man to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as to his <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end. Every adult <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> stained either with <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> or with actual mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (children are of course excepted) must, in order to arrive at the state of justification, pass through a short or long process of justification, which may be likened to the gradual development of the child in its mother's womb. This development attains its fullness in the birth of the child, accompanied by the anguish and suffering with which this birth is invariably attended; our rebirth in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is likewise preceded by great spiritual sufferings of fear and contrition.

<p>In the process of justification we must distinguish two periods: first, the preparatory acts or dispositions (faith, fear, hope, etc.); then the last, decisive moment of the transformation of the sinner from the state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to that of justification or sanctifying grace, which may be called the active justification (<em>actus justificationis</em>) with this the real process comes to an end, and the state of habitual <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and sonship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> begins. Touching both of these periods there has existed, and still exists, in part, a great conflict of opinion between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>.

<p>This conflict may be reduced to four differences of teaching. By a justifying <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> understands qualitatively the theoretical <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of Revelation, and demands over and above this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> other acts of preparation for justification. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, on the other hand, reduces the process of justification to merely a fiduciary <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and maintains that this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, exclusive even of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, is all-sufficient for justification, laying great stress upon the scriptural statement <em>sola fides justificat.</em> The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> teaches that justification consists of an actual obliteration of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and an interior sanctification. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, on the other hand, makes of the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> merely a concealment of it, so to speak; and of the sanctification a forensic declaration of justification, or an external imputation of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. In the presentation of the process of justification, we will everywhere note this fourfold confessional conflict.
<h3 id="A">The fiduciary faith of the Protestants</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. VI, cap. vi, and can. xii) decrees that not the fiduciary <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but a real <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, consisting of a firm <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in all <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> makes up the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of justification and the "beginning, foundation, and source" (loc. cit., cap. viii) of justification. What did the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> with <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> understand by fiduciary <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? They understood thereby not the first or fundamental deposition or preparation for the (active) justification, but merely the spiritual grasp (<em>instrumentum</em>) with which we seize and lay hold of the external <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of Christ and with it, as with a mantle of grace, cover our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> (which still continue to exist interiorly) in the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a>, certain <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> (fiducia) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the sake of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, will no longer hold our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against us. Hereby the seat of justifying <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is transferred from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to the will; and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself, in as far as it still abides in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, is converted into a certain <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in one's own justification. The main question is: "Is this conception Biblical?" <a href="../cathen/10646c.htm">Murray</a> (De gratia, disp. x, n. 18, Dublin, 1877) states in his statistics that the word <em>fides</em> (<em>pistis</em>) occurs eighty times in the Epistle to the Romans and in the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">synoptic Gospels</a>, and in only six of these can it be construed to mean <em>fiducia.</em> But neither here nor anywhere else does it ever mean the conviction of, or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in, one's own justification, or the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> fiduciary <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Even in the leading text (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#vrs5">Romans 4:5</a>) the justifying <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> is identical with the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; for Abraham was justified not by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in his own justification, but by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Divine promise that he would be the "father of many nations" (cf. <a href="../bible/rom004.htm#vrs9">Romans 4:9 sqq.</a>). In strict accord with this is the Pauline teaching that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of justification, which we must profess "with heart and mouth", is identical with the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of Christ</a>, the central <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> (<a href="../bible/rom010.htm#vrs9">Romans 10:9 sq.</a>) and that the minimum expressly <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for justification is contained in the two <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>: the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of eternal reward (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#vrs6">Hebrews 11:6</a>).



<p>The Redeemer Himself made <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the teaching of the gospel a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> condition for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, when he solemnly commanded the Apostles to preach the Gospel to the whole world (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs15">Mark 16:15</a>). <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a> declares his Gospel has been written for the purpose of exciting <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the Divine Sonship of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and links to this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the possession of eternal life (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs31">John 20:31</a>). Such was the mind of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from the beginning. To say nothing of the testimony of the Fathers (cf. <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, De justific., I, 9), <a href="../cathen/06315a.htm">Saint Fulgentius</a>, a disciple of St. Augustine, in his precious booklet, "De vera fide ad Petrum", does not understand by <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> a fiduciary <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but the firm <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in all the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> contained in the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a>, and he calls this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the "Foundation of all good things", and the "Beginning of human salvation" (loc. cit., Prolog.). The practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the earliest ages, as shown by the ancient custom, going back to Apostolic times, of giving the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> (<em>katechoumenoi</em> from <em>katechein</em>, <em>viva voce instruere</em>) a verbal instruction in the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> and of directing them, shortly before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, to make a public recitation of the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a>, strengthens this view. After this they were called not <em>fiduciales</em> but <em>fideles</em>, in contra-distinction to <em>infidels</em> and <em>haeretici</em> (from <em>aireisthai</em>, to select, to proceed eclectically) who rejected Revelation as a whole or in part.

<p>In answer to the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> question: How many <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> must one expressly (<em>fide explicita</em>) believe under command (<em>necessitate praecepti</em>)? <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> say that an ordinary <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> must expressly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and believe the most important <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of the moral law, for instance, the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a>, the six <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the Seven Sacraments, the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Our Father</a>. Greater things are, of course, expected from the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>, especially from catechists, confessors, preachers wherefore upon these the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> rests as an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. If the question be put: In how many <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> as a means (<em>necessitate medii</em>) must one believe to be saved? many catechists answer <em>Six things:</em> <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God's existence</a>; an eternal reward; the Trinity; the Incarnation; the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; the necessity of Grace. But according to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#vrs6">Hebrews 11:6</a>) we can only be certain of the necessity of the first two <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the Trinity and the Incarnation could not of course be exacted from ante-Christian <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> or from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Paganism</a>. Then, too, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the Trinity may be implicitly included in the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God's existence</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the Incarnation in the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>, just as the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is implicitly included in the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of an eternal reward. However, there arises for any one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, and entering thus the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the necessity of making an act of explicit <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (<em>fides explicita</em>). This necessity (<em>necessitas medii</em>) arises <em>per accidens</em>, and is suspended only by a Divine dispensation in cases of extreme necessity, where such an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is either physically or morally impossible, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> or those dying in a state of unconsciousness. For further matter on this point see Pohle, "Lehrbuch der Dogmatik", 4th ed., II, 488 sqq. (Paderborn, 1909).
<h3 id="B">The "sola fides" doctrine of the Protestants</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. VI, can. ix) decrees that over and above the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which formally dwells in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, other acts of predisposition, arising from the will, such as fear, hope, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, contrition, and good resolution (loc. cit., cap. vi), are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the reception of the grace of justification. This definition was made by the council as against the second fundamental <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, namely that "faith alone justifies" (<em>sola fides justificat</em>).

<p><a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Martin Luther</a> stands as the originator of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, for he hoped that in this way he might be able to calm his own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, which was in a state of great perturbation, and consequently he took refuge behind the assertion that the necessity of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> over and above mere <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was altogether a <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">pharisaical</a> supposition. Manifestly this did not bring him the peace and comfort for which he had hoped, and at least it brought no conviction to his mind; for many times, in a spirit of honesty and sheer good nature, he applauded <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, but recognized them only as <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> concomitants, not as efficient dispositions, for justification. This was also the tenor of <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin's</a> interpretation (Institute, III, 11, 19). <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> was surprised to find himself by his unprecedented <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in direct contradiction to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, therefore he rejected the Epistle of St. James as "one of straw" and into the text of <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#vrs28">St. Paul to the Romans (3:28)</a> he boldly inserted the word <em>alone.</em> This falsification of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> was certainly not done in the spirit of the Apostle's teaching, for nowhere does <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> teach that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone (without charity) will bring justification, even though we should accept as also Pauline the text given in a different context, that <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone justifies but the fruitless works of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Jewish Law</a> do not.

<p>In this statement <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> emphasizes the fact that grace is purely gratuitous; that no merely natural <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> can merit grace; but he does not state that no other acts in their nature and purport predisposing are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for justification over and above the requisite <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Any other construction of the above passage would be violent and incorrect. If <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> interpretation were allowed to stand, then <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> would come into direct contradiction not only with St. James (ii, 24 sqq.), but also with himself; for, except St. John, the favourite Apostle, he is the most outspoken of all Apostles in proclaiming the necessity and excellence of charity over <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the matter of justification (cf. <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#vrs1">1 Corinthians 13:1 sqq.</a>). Whenever <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> justifies it is not <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, but <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> made operative and replenished by charity (cf. <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#vrs6">Galatians 5:6</a>, "fides, quae per caritatem operatur"). In the plainest language the Apostle St. James says this: "ex operibus justificatur homo, et non ex fide tantum" (<a href="../bible/jam002.htm#vrs2">James 2:2</a>); and here, by works, he does not understand the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> to which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> refers in the Epistle to the Romans, or the works done in fulfilment of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Jewish Law</a>, but the works of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> made possible by the operation of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> grace, which was recognized by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (lib. LXXXIII, Q. lxxvi n. 2). In conformity with this interpretation and with this only is the tenor of the Scriptural <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, namely, that over and above <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> other acts are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for justification, such as fear (Ecclus., i, 28), and hope (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs24">Romans 8:24</a>), charity (<a href="../bible/luk007.htm#vrs47">Luke 7:47</a>), penance with contrition (<a href="../bible/luk013.htm#vrs3">Luke 13:3</a>; <a href="../bible/act002.htm#vrs38">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="../bible/act003.htm#vrs19">3:19</a>), <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a> (<a href="../bible/dan004.htm#vrs24">Daniel 4:24</a>; Tob., xii, 9). Without charity and the <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is dead. Faith receives life only from and through charity (<a href="../bible/jam002.htm#vrs2">James 2:2</a>). Only to dead <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (<em>fides informis</em>) is the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> applied: "Faith alone does not justify". On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> informed by charity (<em>fides formata</em>) has the power of justification. St. Augustine (<a href="../fathers/130115.htm"><em>On the Holy Trinity</em> XV.18</a>) expresses it pithily thus: "Sine caritate quippe fides potest quidem esse, sed non et prodesse." Hence we see that from the very beginning the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has taught that not only <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> but that a sincere conversion of heart effected by charity and contrition is also requisite for justification--witness the regular method of administering <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and the discipline of penance in the early Church.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. VI, cap. viii) has, in the light of Revelation, assigned to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the only correct status in the process of justification, inasmuch as the council, by declaring it to be the "beginning, the foundation, and the root", has placed <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> at the very front in the whole process.

<p>Faith is the beginning of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, because no one can be converted to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> unless he recognize Him as his <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end and aim, just as a mariner without an objective and without a compass wanders aimlessly over the sea at the mercy of wind and wave. <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is not only the initiatory act of justification, but the foundation as well, because upon it all the other predisposing acts rest securely, not in geometric regularity or inert as the stones of a building rest upon a foundation, but organically and imbued with life as the branches and blossoms spring from a root or stem. Thus there is preserved to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> system its fundamental and co-ordinating significance in the matter of justification. A masterly, <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> description of the whole process of justification, which even Ad. Harnack styles "a magnificent work of art", will be found in the famous cap. vi, "Disponuntur" (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, n. 798). According to this the process of justification follows a regular order of progression in four stages: from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to fear, from fear to hope, from hope to incipient charity, from incipient charity to contrition with purpose of amendment. If the contrition be perfect (<em>contritio caritate perfecta</em>), then active justification results, that is, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is immediately placed in the state of grace even before the reception of the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> or penance, though not without the desire for the sacrament (<em>votum sacramenti</em>). If, on the other hand, the contrition be only an imperfect one (<em>attritio</em>), then the sanctifying grace can only be imparted by the actual reception of the sacrament (cf. Trent, Sess. VI, cc. iv and xiv). The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> had no intention, however, of making the sequence of the various stages in the process of justification, given above, inflexible; nor of making any one of the stages indispensable. Since a real conversion is inconceivable without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and contrition, we naturally place <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> at the beginning and contrition at the end of the process. In exceptional cases, however, for example in sudden conversions, it is quite possible for the sinner to overlap the intervening stages between <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and charity, in which case fear, hope, and contrition are virtually included in charity.

<p>The "justification by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone" theory was by <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> styled the article of the standing and falling church (<em>articulus stantis et cadentis ecclesiae</em>), and by his followers was regarded as the material principle of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, just as the sufficiency of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> without tradition was considered its formal principle. Both of these principles are un-Biblical and are not accepted anywhere today in their original severity, save only in the very small circle of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran Church</a> of Scandinavia has, according to the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> Krogh-Tonningh, experienced a silent reformation which in the lapse of the several centuries has gradually brought it back to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> view of justification, which view alone can be supported by Revelation and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> experience (cf. Dorner, "Geschichte der protestantischen Theologie", 361 sqq., <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 1867; M&ouml;hler, "Symbolik", 16, Mainz, 1890; "Realencyk. fur prot. Theol.", s.v. "Rechtfertigung").
<h3 id="C">The Protestant theory of non-imputation</h3>

<p>Embarrassed by the fatal notion that <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> wrought in man an utter destruction extending even to the annihilation of all moral freedom of election, and that it continues its existence even in the just man as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the shade of an ineradicable <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Martin Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> taught very <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> that a sinner is justified by fiduciary <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in such a way, however, that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not absolutely removed or wiped out, but merely <em>covered up</em> or not held against the sinner. According to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, however, in active justification an actual and real forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> takes place so that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is really removed from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not only <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> but also mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by the sacrament of penance (Trent, Sess. V, can. v; Sess. VI, cap. xiv; Sess. XIV, cap. ii). This view is entirely consonant with the teaching of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, for the Biblical expressions: "blotting out" as applied to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (<a href="../bible/psa001.htm#vrs3">Psalm 1:3</a>; <a href="../bible/isa043.htm#vrs25">Isaiah 43:25</a>; <a href="../bible/isa044.htm#vrs22">44:22</a>; <a href="../bible/act003.htm#vrs19">Acts 3:19</a>), "exhausting" (<a href="../bible/heb009.htm#vrs28">Hebrews 9:28</a>), "taking away" [<a href="../bible/2sa012.htm#vrs13">2 Samuel 12:13</a>; <a href="../bible/1ch021.htm#vrs8">1 Chronicles 21:8</a>; Mich., vii, 18; <a href="../bible/psa010.htm#vrs15">Psalm 10:15</a> and <a href="../bible/psa102.htm#vrs12">102:12</a>], cannot be reconciled with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a mere covering up of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is supposed to continue its existence in a covert manner. Other Biblical expressions are just as irreconcilable with this <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, for instance, the expression of "cleansing" and "washing away" the mire of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (<a href="../bible/psa001.htm#vrs4">Psalm 1:4, 9</a>; <a href="../bible/isa001.htm#vrs18">Isaiah 1:18</a>; <a href="../bible/eze036.htm#vrs25">Ezekiel 36:25</a>; <a href="../bible/1co006.htm#vrs11">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>; <a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs5">Revelation 1:5</a>), that of coming "from death to life" (Col. ii., 13; <a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#vrs14">1 John 3:14</a>); the removal from darkness to light (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#vrs9">Ephesians 5:9</a>). Especially these latter expressions are significant, because they characterize the justification as a movement from one thing to another which is directly contrary or opposed to the thing from which the movement is made. The opposites, black and white, night and day, darkness and light, life and death, have this peculiarity, that the presence of one means the extinction of its opposite. Just as the sun dispels all darkness, so does the advent of justifying grace drive away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which ceases from that on to have an existence at least in the <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> order of things, though in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> it may have a shadowy kind of existence as something which once was, but has ceased to be. It becomes intelligible, therefore, that in him who is justified, though <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> remain, there is "no condemnation" (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs50">Romans 8:50</a>); and why, according to James (i, 14 sqq.), <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> as such is really no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and it is apparent that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#vrs17">Romans 7:17</a>) is speaking only figuratively when he calls <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because it springs from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and brings <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in its train. Where in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> the expressions "covering up" and "not imputing" <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> occur, as for instance in <a href="../bible/psa031.htm#vrs1">Psalm 31:1 sq.</a>, they must be interpreted in accordance with the Divine perfections, for it is repugnant that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should declare any one free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to whom <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is still actually cleaving. It is one of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> attributes always to substantiate His declarations; if He covers <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and does not impute it, this can only be effected by an utter extinction or blotting out of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Tradition also has always taught this view of the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, "Die abendl&auml;ndischen Schriftausleger bis Luther uber justitia Dei and justificatio", Mainz, 1905)
<h3 id="D">The Protestant theory of imputation</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> rested his theory with the negative moment, holding that justification ends with the mere forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in the sense of not imputing the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but other <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> (<a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>) demanded a positive moment as well, concerning the nature of which there was a very pronounced disagreement. At the time of Osiander (d. 1552) there were from fourteen to twenty opinions on the matter, each differing from every other; but they had this in common that they all denied the interior <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and the inherent justification of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the process. Among the adherents of the Augsburg Confession the following view was rather generally accepted: The <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to be justified seizes by means of the fiduciary <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the exterior <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and therewith covers his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; this exterior <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is imputed to him as if it were his own, and he stands before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as having an outward justification, but in his inner self he remains the same sinner as of old. This exterior, forensic declaration of justification was received with great acclaim by the frenzied, fanatical masses of that time, and was given wide and vociferous expression in the cry: "Justitia Christi <em>extra nos</em>".

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> maintains that the formal cause of justification does not consist in an exterior imputation of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but in a real, interior sanctification effected by grace, which abounds in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and makes it permanently holy before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (cf. Trent, Sess. VI, cap. vii; can. xi). Although the sinner is justified by the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, inasmuch as the Redeemer has merited for him the grace of justification (<em>causa meritoria</em>), nevertheless he is formally justified and made holy by his own personal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> (<em>causa formalis</em>), just as a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> by his own inherent learning becomes a scholar, not, however, by any exterior imputation of the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (Trent, Sess. VI, can. x). To this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of inherent <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> which <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> call sanctifying grace are we safely conducted by the words of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>.

<p>To prove this we may remark that the word <em>justificare</em> (Gr. <em>dikaioun</em>) in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> may have a fourfold meaning: <ul><li>The forensic declaration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> by a tribunal or court (cf. <a href="../bible/isa005.htm#vrs23">Isaiah 5:23</a>; <a href="../bible/pro017.htm#vrs15">Proverbs 17:15</a>). <li>The interior growth in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> (<a href="../bible/rev022.htm#vrs11">Revelation 22:11</a>). <li>As a substantive, <em>justificatio</em>, the external law (<a href="../bible/psa108.htm#vrs8">Psalm 108:8</a>, and elsewhere). <li>The inner, immanent sanctification of the sinner.</ul> Only this last meaning can be intended where there is mention of passing to a new life (<a href="../bible/eph002.htm#vrs5">Ephesians 2:5</a>; <a href="../bible/col002.htm#vrs13">Colossians 2:13</a>; <a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#vrs14">1 John 3:14</a>); renovation in spirit (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#vrs23">Ephesians 4:23 sq.</a>); <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs29">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="../bible/2co003.htm#vrs18">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#vrs4">2 Peter 1:4</a>) a new creation (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#vrs17">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="../bible/gal006.htm#vrs15">Galatians 6:15</a>); rebirth in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs5">John 3:5</a>; <a href="../bible/tit003.htm#vrs5">Titus 3:5</a>; <a href="../bible/jam001.htm#vrs18">James 1:18</a>), etc., all of which designations not only imply a setting aside of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but express as well a permanent state of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. All of these terms express not an aid to action, but rather a form of being; and this appears also from the fact that the grace of justification is described as being "poured forth in our hearts" (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs5">Romans 5:5</a>); as "the spirit of adoption of sons" of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs15">Romans 8:15</a>); as the "spirit, born of the spirit" (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs6">John 3:6</a>); making us "conformable to the image of the Son" (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs28">Romans 8:28</a>); as a participation in the Divine nature (<a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#vrs4">2 Peter 1:4</a>); the abiding seed in us (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#vrs9">1 John 3:9</a>), and so on. As regards the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, even Harnack admits that St. Augustine faithfully reproduces the teaching of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> need not go back to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, but only to St. Augustine, for the purpose of demonstrating that the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> theory of imputation is at once against <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and St. Augustine.

<p>Moreover, this theory must be rejected as not being in accordance with reason. For in a man who is at once <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> and just, half holy and half unholy, we cannot possibly recognize a masterpiece of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a>, but only a wretched caricature, the deformity of which is exaggerated all the more by the violent introduction of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> consequences which follow from this system, and which have been <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> themselves, are indeed appalling to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. It would follow that, since the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of Christ is always and ever the same, every <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> justified, from the ordinary everyday <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, would possess precisely the same justification and would have, in degree and kind, the same <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. This deduction was expressly made by <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. Can any man of sound mind accept it? If this be so, then the justification of children by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is impossible, for, not having come to the age of reason, they cannot have the fiduciary <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> wherewith they must seize the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of Christ to cover up their <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Very <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a>, <a href="../cathen/10190b.htm">Mennonites</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptists</a> reject the validity of infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. It would likewise follow that the justification acquired by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone could be forfeited only by infidelity, a most awful consequence which <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> (De Wette, II, 37) clothed in the following words, though he could hardly have meant them seriously: "Pecca fortiter et crede fortius et nihil nocebunt centum homicidia et mille stupra." Luckily this inexorable <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> falls powerless against the decency and good <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> of our time, and is, therefore, harmless now, though it was not so at the time of the <a href="../cathen/11597a.htm">Peasants' War</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. VI, cap. vii) <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> that the inherent <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not only the formal cause of justification, but as well the only formal cause (<em>unica formalis causa</em>); this was done as against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> teaching of the Reformer <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Bucer</a> (d. 1551), who held that the inherent <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> must be supplemented by the imputed <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. A further object of this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was to check the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> <a href="../cathen/12082a.htm">Albert Pighius</a> and others, who seemed to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the inner <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> could be ample for justification without being supplemented by another favour of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<em>favor Dei externus</em>) (cf. <a href="../cathen/11426a.htm">Pallavacini</a>, Hist. Conc. Trident., VIII, 11, 12). This <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was well-founded, for the nature and operation of justification are determined by the infusion of sanctifying grace. In other words without the aid of other factors, sanctifying grace in itself possesses the power to effect the destruction of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the interior sanctification of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be justified. For since <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and grace are diametrically opposed to each other, the mere advent of grace is sufficient to drive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> away; and thus grace, in its positive operations, immediately brings about <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, kinship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and a renovation of spirit, etc. From this it follows that in the present process of justification, the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, both original and mortal, is linked to the infusion of sanctifying grace as a <em>conditio sine qua non</em>, and therefore a remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without a simultaneous interior sanctification is theologically impossible. As to the interesting controversy whether the incompatibility of grace and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> rests on merely moral, or physical, or metaphysical contrariety, refer to Pohle ("Lehrbuch der Dogmatik", II 511 sqq., Paderborn, 1909); <a href="../cathen/13525b.htm">Scheeben</a> ("Die Myst. des Christentums", 543 sqq., Freiburg, 1898).
<h2 id="section2">The nature of sanctifying grace</h2>

<p>The real nature of sanctifying grace is, by reason of its direct invisibility, veiled in mystery, so that we can learn its nature better by a study of its formal operations in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> than by a study of the grace itself. Indissolubly linked to the nature of this grace and to its formal operations are other manifestations of grace which are referable not to any intrinsic necessity but to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; accordingly three questions present themselves for consideration: <blockquote> (a) The inner nature of sanctifying grace. <br>(b) Its formal operations. <br>(c) Its <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> retinue. </blockquote>
<h3 id="A">The inner nature</h3>

<p>1. As we have seen that sanctifying grace designates a grace producing a permanent condition, it follows that it must not be confounded with a particular <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a> nor with a series of <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual graces</a>, as some ante-Tridentine <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> seem to have held. This view is confirmed by the fact that the grace imparted to children in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> does not differ essentially from the sanctifying grace imparted to adults, an opinion which was not considered as altogether certain under <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a> (1201), was regarded as having a high degree of probability by <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Pope Clement V</a> (1311), and was defined as certain by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. V, can. iii-v). Baptized infants cannot be justified by the use of <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a>, but only by a grace which effects or produces a certain condition in the recipient. Is this grace of condition or state, as <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> (Sent., I, dist. xvii, 18) held, identical with the Holy Spirit, whom we may call the permanent, uncreated grace (<em>gratia increata</em>)? It is quite impossible. For the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Holy Ghost cannot be poured out into our hearts (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs5">Romans 5:5</a>), nor does it cleave to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as inherent <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> (Trent, sess. VI, can. xi), nor can it be increased by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> (loc. cit., can. xxiv), and all this is apart from the fact that the justifying grace in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> is expressly termed a "gift [or grace] of the Holy Ghost" (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#vrs38">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="../bible/act010.htm#vrs45">10:45</a>), and as the abiding seed of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#vrs9">1 John 3:9</a>). From this it follows that the grace must be as distinct from the Holy Ghost as the gift from the giver and the seed from the sower; consequently the Holy Spirit is our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, not by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> by which He Himself is holy, but by that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> by which He makes us holy. He is not, therefore, the <em>causa formalis</em>, but merely the <em>causa efficiens</em>, of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>.

<p>Moreover, sanctifying grace as an active reality, and not a merely external relation, must be philosophically either substance or accident. Now, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> not a substance which exists by itself, or apart from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, therefore it is a physical accident inhering in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> becomes the subject in which grace inheres; but such an accident is in <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> called quality (<em>qualitas, poiotes</em>) therefore sanctifying grace may be philosophically termed a "permanent, supernatural <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the soul", or, as the <a href="../cathen/13120c.htm">Roman Catechism</a> (P. II, cap. ii, de bap., n. 50) says "divina qualitas in anima inhaerens".

<p>2. Sanctifying grace cannot be termed a habit (<em>habitus</em>) with the same precision as it is called a quality. <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">Metaphysicians</a> enumerate four kinds of quality: <ul><li>habit and disposition; <li>power and want of power; <li>passion and passible quality, for example, to blush, pale with wrath; <li>form and figure (cf. Aristotle, Categ. VI).</ul> Manifestly sanctifying grace must be placed in the first of these four classes, namely habit or disposition; but as dispositions are fleeting things, and habit has a permanency <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> agree that sanctifying grace is undoubtedly a habit, hence the name: Habitual Grace (<em>gratia habitualis</em>). <em>Habitus</em> is subdivided into <em>habitus entitativus</em> and <em>habitus operativus.</em> A <em>habitus entitativus</em> is a quality or condition added to a substance by which condition or quality the substance is found permanently good or bad, for instance: sickness or health, beauty, deformity, etc. <em>Habitus operativus</em> is a disposition to produce certain operations or acts, for instance, moderation or extravagance; this <em>habitus</em> is called either virtue or vice just as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is inclined thereby to a moral good or to a moral <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now, since sanctifying grace does not of itself impart any such readiness, celerity, or facility in action, we must consider it primarily as a <em>habitus entitativus</em>, not as a <em>habitus operativus.</em> Therefore, since the popular concept of <em>habitus</em>, which usually designates a readiness, does not accurately express the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of sanctifying grace, another term is employed, i.e. a quality after the manner of a habit (<em>qualitas per modum habitus</em>), and this term is applied with <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> (De grat. et lib. arbit., I, iii). Grace, however, preserves an inner relation to a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> activity, because it does not impart to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the act but rather the disposition to perform <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> and meritorious acts therefore grace is remotely and mediately a disposition to act (<em>habitus remote operativus</em>). On account of this and other metaphysical subtleties the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> has refrained from applying the term habitus to sanctifying grace.

<p>In the order of nature a distinction is made between natural and acquired habits (<em>habitus innatus</em>, and <em>habitus acquisitus</em>), to distinguish between natural <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instincts</a>, such, for instance, as are common to the brute creation, and acquired habits such as we develop by practice, for instance skill in playing a musical instrument etc. But grace is <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, and cannot, therefore, be classed either as a natural or an acquired habit; it can only be received, accordingly, by infusion from above, therefore it is a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> infused habit (<em>habitus infusus</em>).

<p>3. If <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> could succeed in establishing the identity sometimes maintained between the nature of grace and charity, a great step forward would be taken in the examination of the nature of grace, for we are more familiar with the infused virtue of charity than with the hidden mysterious nature of sanctifying grace. For the identity of grace and charity some of the older <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> have contended--Peter Lombard, <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>, <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, <a href="../cathen/09192a.htm">Lessius</a>, and others--declaring that, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and the teaching of the Fathers, the process of justification may be at times attributable to sanctifying grace and at other times to the virtue of charity. Similar effects demand a similar cause; therefore there exists, in this view, merely a virtual distinction between the two, inasmuch as one and the same reality appears under one aspect as grace, and under another as charity. This similarity is confirmed by the further fact that the life or death of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is occasioned respectively by the presence in, or absence from, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of charity. Nevertheless, all these arguments may tend to establish a similarity, but do not prove a case of identity. Probably the correct view is that which sees a real distinction between grace and charity, and this view is held by most <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, including <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> and Francisco Su&aacute;rez. Many passages in Scripture and patrology and in the enactments of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> confirm this view. Often, indeed, grace and charity are placed side by side, which could not be done without a pleonasm if they were identical. Lastly, sanctifying grace is a <em>habitus entitativus</em>, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> charity a <em>habitus operativus</em>: the former, namely sanctifying grace, being a <em>habitus entitativus</em>, informs and transforms the substance of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; the latter, namely charity, being a <em>habitus operativus</em>, supernaturally informs and influences the will (cf. <a href="../cathen/13062b.htm">Ripalda</a>, "De ente sup.", disp. cxxiii; Billuart, "De gratia", disp. iv, 4).

<p>4. The climax of the presentation of the nature of sanctifying grace is found in its character as a participation in the Divine nature, which in a measure indicates its specific difference. To this undeniable fact of the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> participation in the Divine nature is our attention directed not only by the express words of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>: <em>ut efficiamini divinae consortes naturae</em> (<a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#vrs4">2 Peter 1:4</a>), but also by the Biblical concept of "the issue and birth from God", since the begotten must receive of the nature of the progenitor, though in this case it only holds in an accidental and analogical sense. Since this same <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> has been found in the writings of the Fathers, and is incorporated in the liturgy of the Mass, to dispute or reject it would be nothing short of temerity. It is difficult to excogitate a manner (<em>modus</em>) in which this participation of the Divine nature is effected. Two extremes must be avoided, so that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> will be found.

<p>An exaggerated theory was taught by certain mystics and <a href="../cathen/12608c.htm">quietists</a>, a theory not free from pantheiotic taint. In this view the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is formally changed into <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, an altogether untenable and impossible hypothesis, since <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> remains even after justification, and the presence of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is, of course, absolutely repugnant to the Divine nature.

<p>Another theory, held by the <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotists</a>, teaches that the participation is merely of a moral-juridical nature, and not in the least a physical participation. But since sanctifying grace is a physical accident in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, one cannot help referring such participation in the Divine nature to a physical and interior assimilation with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by virtue of which we are permitted to share those goods of the Divine order to which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone by His own nature can lay claim. In any event the "participatio divinae naturae" is not in any sense to be considered a deification, but only a making of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> "like unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". To the difficult question: Of which special <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">attribute of God</a> does this participation partake? <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> can answer only by conjectures. Manifestly only the communicable attributes can at all be considered in the matter, wherefore <a href="../cathen/06634a.htm">Gonet</a> (Clyp. thomist., IV, ii, x) was clearly wrong when he said that the attribute of participation was the <em>aseitas</em>, absolutely the most incommunicable of all the <a href="../cathen/02062e.htm">Divine attributes</a>. <a href="../cathen/13062b.htm">Ripalda</a> (loc. cit., disp. xx; <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. 14) is probably nearer the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> when he suggests Divine <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> as the attribute, for the very <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of sanctifying grace brings the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> into the foreground.

<p>The theory of Francisco Su&aacute;rez (De grat., VII, i, xxx), which is also favoured by Scripture and the Fathers, is perhaps the most plausible. In this theory sanctifying grace imparts to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> a participation in the Divine spirituality, which no <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">rational</a> creature can by its own unaided powers penetrate or comprehend. It is, therefore, the office of grace to impart to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> way, that degree of spirituality which is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to give us an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His spirit, either here below in the shadows of earthly existence, or there above in the unveiled splendour of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. If we were asked to condense all that we have thus far been considering into a definition, we would formulate the following: Sanctifying grace is "a quality strictly <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, inherent in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as a <em>habitus</em>, by which we are made to participate in the divine nature".
<h3 id="B">Formal operations</h3>

<p>Sanctifying Grace has its formal operations, which are fundamentally nothing else than the formal cause considered in its various moments. These operations are made known by Revelation; therefore to children and to the faithful can the splendour of grace best be presented by a vivid description of its operations. These are: <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, beauty, friendship, and sonship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><em>1. Sanctity</em>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as its first formal operation, is contained in the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> itself of sanctifying grace, inasmuch as the infusion of it makes the subject holy and inaugurates the state or condition of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. So far it is, as to its nature, a <em>physical</em> adornment of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; it is also a <em>moral form</em> of sanctification, which of itself makes <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> children just and holy in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This first operation is thrown into relief by the fact that the "new man", created <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#vrs24">Ephesians 4:24</a>), was preceded by the "old man" of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and that grace changed the sinner into a saint (Trent, Sess. VI, cap. vii: <em>ex injusto fit justus</em>). The two moments of actual justification, namely the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the sanctification, are at the same time moments of habitual justification, and become the formal operations of grace. The mere infusion of the grace effects at once the remission of original and mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and inaugurates the condition or state of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. (See Pohle, Lehrb. der Dogm., 527 sq.)

<p><em>2. Beauty</em>

<p>Although the beauty of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not mentioned by the teaching office of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as one of the operations of grace, nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/13120c.htm">Roman Catechism</a> refers to it (P. II, cap. ii, de bap., n. 50). If it be permissible to understand by the spouse in the Canticle of Canticles a symbol of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> decked in grace, then all the passages touching the ravishing beauty of the spouse may find a fitting application to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Hence it is that the Fathers express the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> beauty of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in grace by the most splendid comparisons and figures of speech, for instance: "a divine picture" (Ambrose); "a golden <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>" (<a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>); "a streaming light" (Basil), etc. Assuming that, apart from the material beauty expressed in the <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a>, there exists a purely spiritual beauty, we can safely state that grace as the participation in the Divine nature, calls forth in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> a physical reflection of the uncreated beauty of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is not to be compared with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> natural likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. We can attain to a more intimate <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the Divine likeness in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> adorned with grace, if we refer the picture not merely to the absolute Divine nature, as the prototype of all beauty, but more especially to the Trinity whose glorious nature is so charmingly mirrored in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the Divine adoption and the inhabitation of the Holy Ghost (cf. H. Krug, De pulchritudine divina, Freiburg, 1902).

<p><em>3. Friendship</em>

<p>The friendship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is consequently, one of the most excellent of the effects of grace; <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> denied the possibility of such a friendship by reason of the great disparity between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man. As a matter of fact man is, inasmuch as he is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> creature, His servant, and by reason of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (original and mortal) he is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> enemy. This relation of service and enmity is transformed by sanctifying grace into one of friendship (Trent, Sess. VI, cap. vii: <em>ex inimico amicus</em>). According to the Scriptural concept (<a href="../bible/wis007.htm#vrs14">Wisdom 7:14</a>; <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#vrs15">John 15:15</a>) this friendship resembles a mystical matrimonial union between the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and its Divine spouse (<a href="../bible/mat009.htm#vrs15">Matthew 9:15</a>; <a href="../bible/rev019.htm#vrs7">Revelation 19:7</a>). Friendship consists in the mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and esteem of two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> based upon an exchange of service or good office (Aristot., "Eth. Nicom.", VIII sq.). True friendship resting only on virtue (<em>amicitia honesta</em>) demands undeniably a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of benevolence, which seeks only the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and well-being of the friend, whereas the friendly exchange of benefits rests upon a <a href="../cathen/15241c.htm">utilitarian</a> basis (<em>amicitia utilis</em>) or one of pleasure (<em>amicitia delectabilis</em>), which presupposes a selfish <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; still the benevolent <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of friendship must be mutual, because an unrequited <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> becomes merely one of silent admiration, which is not friendship by any means. But the strong bond of union lies undeniably in the fact of a mutual benefit, by reason of which friend regards friend as his other self (<em>alter ego</em>). Finally, between friends an equality of position or station is demanded, and where this does not exist an elevation of the inferior's status (<em>amicitia excellentie</em>), as, for example, in the case of a friendship between a king and noble subject. It is easy to perceive that all these conditions are fulfilled in the friendship between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man effected by grace. For, just as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> regards the just man with the pure <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of benevolence, He likewise prepares him by the infusion of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> charity for the reception of a correspondingly pure and unselfish affection. Again, although man's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is very limited, while <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in man is perfect, this conjecture is sufficient--indeed in human friendships it alone is possible--to form the basis of a friendly relation. The exchange of gifts consists, on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the bestowal of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> benefits, on the part of man, in the promotion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> glory, and partly in the performance of works of fraternal charity. There is, indeed, in the first instance, a vast difference in the respective positions of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man; but by the infusion of grace man receives a patent of nobility, and thus a friendship of excellency (<em>amicitia excellentiae</em>) is established between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the just. (See Schiffini, "De gratia divina", 305 sqq., Freiburg, 1901.)

<p><em>4. Sonship</em>

<p>In the Divine filiation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the formal workings of sanctifying grace reach their culminating point; by it man is entitled to a share in the paternal inheritance, which consists in the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>. This excellence of grace is not only mentioned countless times in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs15">Romans 8:15 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#vrs1">1 John 3:1 sq.</a>, etc.), but is included in the Scriptural <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a <em>re-birth in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a></em> (cf. <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs12">John 1:12 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs5">3:5</a>; <a href="../bible/tit003.htm#vrs5">Titus 3:5</a>; <a href="../bible/jam001.htm#vrs18">James 1:18</a>, etc.). Since the re-birth in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not effected by a substantial issuance from the substance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as in the case of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> or <em>Logos</em> (<em>Christus</em>), but is merely an analogical or accidental coming forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, our sonship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is only of an adoptive kind, as we find it expressed in Scripture (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs15">Romans 8:15</a>; <a href="../bible/gal004.htm#vrs5">Galatians 4:5</a>). This adoption was defined by <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<a href="../summa/4023.htm#article1">III:23:1</a>): <em>personae extraneae in filium et heredem gratuita assumptio.</em> To the nature of this adoption there are four requisites; <ul><li>the original unrelatedness of the adopted <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; <li>fatherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> on the part of the adopting parent for the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> adopted; <li>the absolute gratuity of the choice to sonship and heirship; <li>the consent of the adopted child to the act of adoption.</ul> Applying these conditions to the adoption of man by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we find that <a href="../cathen/01148a.htm">God's adoption</a> exceeds man's in every point, for the sinner is not merely a stranger to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but is as one who has cast off His friendship and become an enemy. In the case of human adoption the mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is presumed as existing, in the case of <a href="../cathen/01148a.htm">God's adoption</a> the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> effects the requisite deposition in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be adopted. The great and unfathomable <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> at once bestows the adoption and the consequent heirship to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, and the value of this inheritance is not diminished by the number of coheirs, as in the case of worldly inheritance.

<p><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not impose His favours upon any one, therefore a consent is expected from adult adopted sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (Trent, Sess. VI, cap. vii, <em>per voluntariam susceptionem gratiae et donorum</em>). It is quite in keeping with the excellence of the heavenly Father that He should supply for His children during the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> a fitting sustenance which will sustain the dignity of their position, and be to them a pledge of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> and eternal life; and this is the Bread of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> (see <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">EUCHARIST</a>).
<h3>The supernatural retinue</h3>

<p>This expression is derived from the <a href="../cathen/13120c.htm">Roman Catechism</a> (P. II., c. i, n. 51), which teaches: "Huic (gratiae sanctificanti) additur nobilissimus omnium virtutum comitatus". As the concomitants of sanctifying grace, these infused virtues are not formal operations, but gifts really distinct from this grace, connected nevertheless with it by a physical, or rather a moral, indissoluble link--relationship. Therefore the Council of Vienne (1311) speaks of <em>informans gratia et virtutes</em>, and the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, in a more general way, of gratia et dona. The three <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> virtues, the moral virtues, the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost, and the personal indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are all considered. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. VI, c. vii) teaches that the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> virtues of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and charity are in the process of justification infused into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> habits. Concerning the time of infusion, it is an <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a> (Sess. VI, can. xi) that the virtue of charity is infused immediately with sanctifying grace, so that throughout the whole term of existence sanctifying grace and charity are found as inseparable companions. Concerning the <em>habitus</em> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope, Francisco Su&aacute;rez is of the opinion (as against <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> and <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>) that, assuming a favourable disposition in the recipient, they are infused earlier in the process of justification. Universally known is the expression of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#vrs13">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>), "And now there remain <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and charity, these three: but the greatest of these is charity." Since, here, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope are placed on a par with charity, but charity is considered as diffused in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs5">Romans 5:5</a>), conveying thus the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of an infused habit, it will be seen that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> so consonant with the teaching of the Fathers is also supported by Scripture. The <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> virtues have <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> directly as their formal object, but the moral virtues are directed in their exercise to created things in their moral relations. All the special moral virtues can be reduced to the four cardinal virtues: <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> (<em>prudentia</em>), <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> (<em>justitia</em>), <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> (<em>fortitudo</em>), temperance (<em>temperantia</em>). The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> favours the opinion that along with grace and charity the four cardinal virtues (and, according to many <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, their subsidiary virtues also) are communicated to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the just as <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <em>habitus</em>, whose office it is to give to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the will, in their moral relations with created things, a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> direction and inclination. By reason of the opposition of the <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotists</a> this view enjoys only a degree of probability, which, however, is supported by passages in Scripture (<a href="../bible/pro008.htm#vrs7">Proverbs 8:7</a>; <a href="../bible/eze011.htm#vrs19">Ezekiel 11:19</a>; <a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#vrs3">2 Peter 1:3 sqq.</a>) as well as the teaching of the Fathers (Augustine, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a>, and others). Some <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> add to the infusion of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and moral virtues also that of the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost, though this view cannot be called anything more than a mere opinion. There are difficulties in the way of the acceptance of this opinion which cannot be here discussed.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a> goes only to this extent, that Christ as man possessed the seven gifts (cf. <a href="../bible/isa011.htm#vrs1">Isaiah 11:1 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/isa061.htm#vrs1">61:1</a>; <a href="../bible/luk004.htm#vrs18">Luke 4:18</a>). Remembering, however, that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs9">Romans 8:9 sqq.</a>) considers Christ, as man, the mystical head of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, and the August exemplar of our own justification, we may possibly assume that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gives in the process of justification also the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost.

<p>The crowning point of justification is found in the personal indwelling of the Holy Spirit. It is the perfection and the supreme adornment of the justified <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Adequately considered, the personal indwelling of the Holy Spirit consists of a twofold grace, the created accidental grace (<em>gratia creata accidentalis</em>) and the uncreated substantial grace (<em>gratia increata substantialis</em>). The former is the basis and the indispensable assumption for the latter; for where <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself erects His throne, there must be found a fitting and becoming adornment. The indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must not be confounded with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> presence in all created things, by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/02062e.htm">Divine attribute</a> of Omnipresence. The personal indwelling of the Holy Ghost in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> rests so securely upon the teaching of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> and of the Fathers that to deny it would constitute a grave <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. In fact, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs5">Romans 5:5</a>) says: "The charity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is poured forth in our hearts, by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, who is given to us". In this passage the Apostle distinguishes clearly between the accidental grace of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> charity and the Person of the Giver. From this it follows that the Holy Spirit has been given to us, and dwells within us (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs11">Romans 8:11</a>), so that we really become <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> of the Holy Ghost (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#vrs16">1 Corinthians 3:16 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/1co006.htm#vrs19">6:19</a>). Among all the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> (excepting, perhaps, St. Augustine) it is the Greeks who are more especially noteworthy for their rapturous utterances touching the infusion of the Holy Ghost. Note the expressions: "The replenishing of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with balsamic odours", "a glow permeating the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>", "a gilding and refining of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>". Against the <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Pneumatomachians</a> they strive to prove the real Divinity of the Holy Spirit from His indwelling, maintaining that only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can establish Himself in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; surely no creature can inhabit any other creatures. But clear and undeniable as the fact of the indwelling is, equally difficult and perplexing is it in degree to explain the method and manner (modus) of this indwelling.

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> offer two explanations. The greater number hold that the indwelling must not be considered a substantial information, nor a <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a>, but that it really means an indwelling of the Trinity (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs23">John 14:23</a>), but is more specifically appropriated to the Holy Ghost by reason of His notional character as the Hypostatic Holiness and Personal Love.

<p>Another small group of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> (<a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Petavius</a>, <a href="../cathen/13525b.htm">Scheeben</a>, <a href="../cathen/07583c.htm">Hurter</a>, etc.), basing their opinion upon the teaching of the Fathers, especially the Greek, distinguish between the <em>inhabitatio totius Trinitatis</em>, and the <em>inhabitatio Spiritus Sancti</em>, and decide that this latter must be regarded as a union (<em>unio, enosis</em>) pertaining to the Holy Ghost alone, from which the other two Persons are excluded. It would be difficult, if not impossible to reconcile this theory, in spite of its deep mystical significance, with the recognized principles of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Trinity, namely the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of appropriation and Divine mission. Hence this theory is almost universally rejected (see <a href="../cathen/06242a.htm">Franzelin</a>, "De Deo trino", thes. xliii-xlviii, Rome, 1881).
<h2 id="section3">The characteristics of sanctifying grace</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> conception of justification boasts of three characteristics: absolute <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> (<em>certitudo</em>), complete uniformity in all the justified (<em>aequalitas</em>), unforfeitableness (<em>inamissibilitas</em>). According to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, sanctifying grace has the opposite characteristics: uncertainty (<em>incertitudo</em>), inequality (<em>inaequalitas</em>), and amissibility (<em>amissibilitas</em>).
<h3 id="A">Uncertainty</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, that man by a fiduciary <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> knows with absolute <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> that he is justified, received the attention of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. VI, cap. ix), in one entire chapter (<em>De inani fiducia haereticorum</em>), three canons (loc. cit., can. xiii-xv) condemning the necessity, the alleged power, and the function of fiduciary <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The object of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in defining the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> was not to shatter the trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<em>certitudo spei</em>) in the matter of personal <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but to repel the misleading assumptions of an unwarranted <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> (<em>certitudo fidei</em>). In doing this the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is altogether obedient to the instruction of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, for, since Scripture declares that we must work out our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> "with fear and trembling" (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#vrs12">Philippians 2:12</a>), it is impossible to regard our individual <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> as something fixed and certain. Why did <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs27">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>) chastise his body if not afraid lest, having preached to others, he might himself "become a castaway"? He says expressly (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#vrs4">1 Corinthians 4:4</a>): "For I am not conscious to myself of any thing, yet am I not hereby justified; but he that judgeth me, is the Lord." Tradition also rejects the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of justification. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope Gregory the Great</a> (lib. VII, ep. xxv) was asked by a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lady of the court, named Gregoria, to say what was the state of her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. He replied that she was putting to him a difficult and useless question, which he could not answer, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had not vouchsafed to him any revelation concerning the state of her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and only after her death could she have any certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as to the forgiveness of her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. No one can be absolutely certain of his or her <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> unless--as to <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Magdalen</a>, to the man with the palsy, or to the penitent thief--a special revelation be given (Trent, Sess. VI, can. xvi). Nor can a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, any more than an absolute <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, be claimed regarding the matter of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, for the spirit of the Gospel is strongly opposed to anything like an unwarranted <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Therefore the rather hostile attitude to the Gospel spirit advanced by Ambrosius Catherinus* (d. 1553), in his little work: "De certitudine gratiae", received such general opposition from other <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. Since no metaphysical <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> can be cherished in the matter of justification in any particular case, we must content ourselves with a moral <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, which, of course, is but warranted in the case of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> children, and which, in the case of adults diminishes more or less, just as all the conditions of, <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> are complied with--not an easy matter to determine. Nevertheless any excessive anxiety and disturbance may be allayed (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs16">Romans 8:16, 38 sq.</a>) by the subjective conviction that we are probably in the state of grace.
<h3 id="B">Inequality</h3>

<p>If man, as the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> theory of justification teaches, is justified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, by the external <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the conclusion which <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Martin Luther</a> (Sermo de nat. Maria) drew must follow, namely that "we are all equal to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary the Mother of God</a> and just as holy as she". But if on the other hand, according to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, we are <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justified</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and merits of Christ in such fashion that this becomes formally our own <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, then there must result an inequality of grace in <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, and for two reasons: first, because according to the generosity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or the receptive condition of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> an unequal amount of grace is infused; then, also, because the grace originally received can be increased by the performance of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> (Trent, Sess. VI, cap. vii, can. xxiv). This possibility of increase in grace by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, whence would follow its inequality in <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, find its warrant in those Scriptural texts in which an increase of grace is either expressed or implied (<a href="../bible/pro004.htm#vrs18">Proverbs 4:18</a>; <a href="../bible/sir018.htm#vrs22">Sirach 18:22</a>; <a href="../bible/2co009.htm#vrs10">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>; <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#vrs7">Ephesians 4:7</a>; <a href="../bible/2pe003.htm#vrs18">2 Peter 3:18</a>; <a href="../bible/rev022.htm#vrs11">Revelation 22:11</a>). Tradition had occasion, as early as the close of the fourth century, to defend the old Faith of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> <a href="../cathen/08530a.htm">Jovinian</a>, who strove to introduce into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the equality of all virtue and all vice. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (Con. Jovin., II, xxiii) was the chief defender of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> in this instance. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> never recognized any other teaching than that laid down by St. Augustine (Tract. in Jo., vi, 8): "Ipsi sancti in ecclesia sunt alii aliis sanctiores, alii aliis meliores." Indeed, this view should commend itself to every thinking man.

<p>The increase of grace is by <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> justly called a <em>second</em> justification (<em>justificatio secunda</em>), as distinct from the first justification (<em>justificatio prima</em>), which is coupled with a remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for, though there be in the second justification no transit from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to grace, there is an advance from grace to a more perfect sharing therein. If inquiry be made as to the mode of this increase, it can only be explained by the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> maxim: "Qualities are susceptible of increase and decrease"; for instance, light and heat by the varying degree of intensity increase or diminish. The question is not a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> but a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> one to decide whether the increase be effected by an addition of grade to grade (<em>additio gradus ad gradum</em>), as most <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> believe; or whether it be by a deeper and firmer taking of root in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (<em>major radicatio in subjecto</em>), as many <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> claim. This question has a special connection with that concerning the multiplication of the <em>habitual</em> act.

<p>But the last question that arises has decidedly a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> phase, namely, can the infusion of sanctifying grace be increased <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a>? Or is there a limit, a point at which it must be arrested? To maintain that the increase can go on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, i.e. that man by successive advances in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> can finally enter into the possession of an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> endowment involves a manifest contradiction, for such a grade is as impossible as an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> temperature in physics. Theoretically, therefore, we can consider only an increase without any real limit (<em>in indefinitum</em>). Practically however, two ideals of unattained and unattainable <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> have been determined, which nevertheless, are finite. The one is the inconceivably great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the other the fullness of grace which dwelt in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the Virgin Mary.
<h3 id="C">Amissibility</h3>

<p>In consonance with his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> made the loss or forfeiture of justification depend solely upon infidelity, while <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> maintained that the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> could not possibly lose their justification; as to those not <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a>, he said, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> merely aroused in them a deceitful show of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and justification. On account of the grave moral dangers which lurked in the assertion that outside of unbelief there can be no serious <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> destructive of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to condemn (Sess. VI, can. xxiii, xxvii) both these views. The lax principles of "evangelical liberty", the favourite catchword of the budding <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, were simply repudiated (Trent Sess. VI, can. xix-xxi). But the synod (Sess. VI cap. xi) added that not venial but only mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> involved the loss of grace. In this declaration there was a perfect accord with <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> and <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Tradition</a>. Even in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Ezechiel (<a href="../bible/eze018.htm#vrs24">Ezekiel 18:24</a>) says of the godless: "All his justices which he hath done, shall not be remembered: in the prevarication, by which he hath prevaricated, and in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which he hath committed, in them he shall die." Not in vain does <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#vrs12">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>) warn the just: "Wherefore he that thinketh himself to stand, let him take heed lest he fall"; and state uncompromisingly: "The <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> shall not possess the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>...neither fornicators, nor <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolaters</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterers</a>.... nor covetous, nor <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkards</a>...shall possess the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#vrs9">1 Corinthians 6:9 sq.</a>). Hence it is not by infidelity alone that the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of Heaven</a> will be lost. Tradition shows that the discipline of confessors in the early Church proclaims the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that grace and justification are lost by mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The principle of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone is unknown to the Fathers. The fact that mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> takes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> out of the state of grace is due to the very nature of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is an absolute turning away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and is an absolute turning to creatures; therefore, habitual mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot exist with habitual grace any more than fire and water can co-exist in the same subject. But as venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not constitute such an open rupture with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and does not destroy the friendship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not expel sanctifying grace from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Hence, St. Augustine says (De spir. et lit., xxviii, 48): "Non impediunt a vita Aeterna justum quaedam peccata venialia, sine quibus haec vita non ducitur."

<p>But does venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, without extinguishing grace, nevertheless diminish it, just as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> give an increase of grace? Denys the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> (d. 1471) was of the opinion that it does, though <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> rejects it (<a href="../summa/3024.htm#article10">II-II:24:10</a>). A gradual decrease of grace would only be possible on the supposition that either a definite number of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> amounted to a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or that the supply of grace might be diminished, grade by grade, down to ultimate extinction. The first hypothesis is contrary to the nature of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; the second leads to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> view that grace may be lost without the commission of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Nevertheless, venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have an indirect influence on the state of grace, for they make a relapse into mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> easy (cf. <a href="../bible/sir019.htm#vrs1">Sirach 19:1</a>). Does the loss of sanctifying grace bring with it the forfeiture of the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> retinue of infused virtues? Since the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> virtue of charity, though not identical, nevertheless is inseparably connected with grace, it is clear that both must stand or fall together, hence the expressions "to fall from grace" and "to lose charity" are equivalent. It is an <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a> (Trent, Sess. VI, can. xxviii, cap. xv) that <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may survive the Commission of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and can be extinguished only by its diametrical opposite, namely, infidelity. It may be regarded as a matter of Church teaching that <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> hope also survives mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, unless this hope should be utterly killed by its extreme opposite, namely despair, though probably it is not destroyed by it second opposite, presumption. With regard to the moral virtues, the seven gifts and the indwelling of the Holy Ghost, which invariably accompany grace and charity, it is clear that when mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> enters into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> they cease to exist (cf. Francisco Su&aacute;rez, "De gratia", IX, 3 sqq.). As to the fruits of sanctifying grace, see <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">MERIT</a>.
