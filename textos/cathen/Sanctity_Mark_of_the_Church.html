<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Sanctity (Mark of the Church)</h1>  

<p>The term "sanctity" is employed in somewhat different senses in relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to individual men, and to a corporate body. As applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> it denotes that absolute <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">moral perfection</a> which is His by nature. In regard to men it signifies a close union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, together with the <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">moral perfection</a> resulting from this union. Hence <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> is said to belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by essence, and to creatures only by participation. Whatever <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> they possess comes to them as a Divine gift. As used of a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, the term means <ul> <li>that this <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> aims at producing <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> in its members, and is possessed of means capable of securing that result, and <li>that the lives of its members correspond, at least in some measure, with the purpose of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, and display a real, not a merely nominal <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. </ul> The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has ever claimed that she, as a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, is holy in a transcendent degree. She teaches that this is one of the four "notes", viz., unity, catholicity, <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">apostolicity</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, by which the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> founded by Christ can be readily distinguished from all human institutions. It is in virtue of her relation to the Person and work of Christ that this attribute belongs to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. She is (1) the fruit of the Passion &#151; the kingdom of the redeemed. Those who remain outside her are the "world" which knows not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#vrs1">1 John 3:1</a>). The object of the Passion was the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> and sanctification of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: "Christ also <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> the church, and delivered Himself up for it: that he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life" (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#vrs25">Ephesians 5:25, 26</a>). Again (2) the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the body of Christ. He is the head of the mystical body: and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> life &#151; the life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself &#151; is communicated through the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to all His members. Just as the Holy Ghost dwelt in the human body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so He now dwells in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: and His presence is so intimate and so efficacious that the Apostle can even speak of Him as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the mystical body: "One body and one Spirit" (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#vrs4">Ephesians 4:4</a>). Thus it follows as a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> consequence from the nature of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and her relation to Christ, that as a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> she must possess means capable of producing <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>: that her members must be characterized by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>: and that this endowment of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> will afford a ready means of distinguishing her from the world.

<p>It is further manifest that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> must be of an entirely <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> character &#151; something altogether beyond the power of unassisted <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And such is in fact the type of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> which Christ and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> require on the part of members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. (1) The virtues which in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ideal are the most fundamental of all, lie altogether outside the scope of the highest <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> ethics. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, and chastity are instances in point. The charity which Christ sets forth in the Sermon on the Mount and in the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the Good <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> &#151; a charity which knows no limits and which embraces enemies as well as friends &#151; exceeds all that <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moralists</a> had deemed possible for men. And this charity Christ requires not of a chosen few, but of all His followers. Humility, which in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> scheme is the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> groundwork of all <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#vrs3">Matthew 18:3</a>), was previously to His teaching an unknown <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. The sense of personal unworthiness in which it consists, is repugnant to all the impulses of unregenerate nature. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> which Christ demands, supposes as its foundation a clear <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the guilt of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and of the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Without these it cannot exist. And these doctrines are sought in vain in other <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> than the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. In regard to chastity Christ not merely warned His followers that to violate this virtue even by a thought, was a grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. He went yet further. He exhorted those of His followers to whom the grace should be given, to live the life of virginity that thereby they might draw nearer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#vrs12">Matthew 19:12</a>).

<p>(2) Another characteristic of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ideal is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of suffering; not as though pleasure were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself, but because suffering is the great means by which our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is intensified and purified. All those who have attained a high degree of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> have learnt to rejoice in suffering, because by it their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was freed from every element of self-seeking, and their lives conformed to that of their Master. Those who have not grasped this principle may call themselves by the name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, but they have not understood the meaning of the Cross.

<p>(3) It has ever been held that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> when it reaches a sublime degree is accompanied by <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">miraculous powers</a>. And Christ promised that this sign should not be lacking to His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, which His followers should work, would, He declared, be no whit less stupendous than those wrought by Himself during His mortal life (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs17">Mark 16:17, 18</a>; <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs12">John 14:12</a>).

<p>Such in brief outline is the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> with which Christ endowed His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and which is to be the distinguishing mark of her children. It is, however, to be noted that He said nothing to suggest that all His followers would make use of the opportunities thus afforded them. On the contrary, He expressly taught that His flock would contain many unworthy members (<a href="../bible/mat013.htm#vrs30">Matthew 13:30, 48</a>). And we may be sure that as within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the lights are brightest, so there too the shadows will be darkest &#151; <em>corruptio optimi pessima</em>. An unworthy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> will fall lower than an unworthy <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>. To show that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> possesses the note of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> it suffices to establish that her teaching is holy: that she is endowed with the means of producing <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> in her children: that, notwithstanding the unfaithfulness of many members, a vast number do in fact cultivate a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> beyond anything that can be found elsewhere: and that in certain cases this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> attains so high a degree that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> honours it with <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> powers.

<p>It is not difficult to show that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, and she alone, fulfils these conditions. In regard to her doctrines, it is manifest that the moral law which she proposes as of Divine <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, is more lofty and more exacting than that which any of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> has ventured to require. Her vindication of the indissolubility of marriage in the face of a licentious world affords the most conspicuous instance of this. She alone maintains in its integrity her Master's teaching on marriage. Every other religious body without exception has given place to the demands of human passion. In regard to the means of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, she, through her seven <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, applies to her members the fruits of the Atonement. She pardons the guilt of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and nourishes the faithful on the Body and Blood of Christ. Nor is the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of her claims less manifest when we consider the result of her work. In the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is found a marvellous succession of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> whose lives are as beacon-lights in the history of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. In <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> the supremacy of Bernard, of <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">Dominic</a>, of Francis, of Ignatius, of Theresa, is as unquestioned as is that of Alexander and of C&aelig;sar in the art of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Outside the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the world has nothing to show which can in any degree compare with them. Within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the succession never fails.

<p>Nor do the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> stand alone. In proportion to the practical influence of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> virtues of which we have spoken above, are found also among the rest of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. These virtues mark a special type of character which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> seeks to realize in her children, and which finds little favour among other claimants to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name. Outside the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the life of virginity is contemned; <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of suffering is viewed as a <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>; and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is regarded as a passive virtue ill-suited to an active and pushing age. Of course it is not meant that we do not find many individual instances of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">God's grace</a> is universal in its range. But it seems beyond question that the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> whose main features we have indicated, is recognized by all as belonging specifically to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, while in her alone does it reach that sublime degree which we see in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> too we see fulfilled <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> promise that the <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">gift of miracles</a> shall not be wanting to His followers. <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">Miracles</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, are not <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. But they are the aura in which the highest <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> moves. And from the time of the Apostles to the nineteenth century the lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> show us that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of nature have been suspended at their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. In numberless cases the evidence for these events is so ample that nothing but the exigencies of controversy can explain the refusal of anti-Catholic writers to admit their occurrence.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> appears to be complete. There can be as little <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> which Church displays the note of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, as there is in regard to the notes of unity, catholicity and <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">apostolicity</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in communion with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">See of Rome</a> and it alone possesses that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> which the words of Christ and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> demand.
