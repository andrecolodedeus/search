<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Sanctuary</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> place giving protection to those fleeing from <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> or <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>; or, the <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a> of taking refuge in such <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> place.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of <a href="../cathen/13431a.htm">sanctuary</a> was based on the inviolability attached to things sacred, and not, as some have held, on the example set by the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12712a.htm">cities of refuge</a>. It was recognized under the Code of <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a> (399) and later by that of <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Justinian</a>. <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13428a.htm">sanction</a> was first given to it by <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a>, about 460, though the first <a href="../cathen/11266b.htm">Council of Orange</a> had dealt with the matter in 441.

<p>The earliest mention of <a href="../cathen/13431a.htm">sanctuary</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was in a code of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by <a href="../cathen/05553b.htm">King Ethelbert</a> in 600. The <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of asylum was originally confined to the church itself, but in course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> its limits were extended to the precincts, and sometimes even to a larger area. Thus, at <a href="../cathen/02540b.htm">Beverley</a> and <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Hexham</a>, the boundaries of <a href="../cathen/13431a.htm">sanctuary</a> extended throughout a radius of a mile from the church, the limits being marked by "sanctuary crosses", some of which still remain.

<p>In Norman times there were two kinds of <a href="../cathen/13431a.htm">sanctuary</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, one belonging to every church by <a href="../cathen/12396x.htm">prescription</a> and the other by special royal character. The latter was considered to afford a much safer asylum and was enjoyed by at least twenty-two churches, including <a href="../cathen/02350c.htm">Battle</a>, <a href="../cathen/02540b.htm">Beverley</a>, Colchester, <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Hexham</a>, <a href="../cathen/11121a.htm">Norwich</a>, <a href="../cathen/13062d.htm">Ripon</a>, <a href="../cathen/02347b.htm">Wells</a>, <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, and York.

<p>A fugitive convicted of felony and taking the benefit of <a href="../cathen/13431a.htm">sanctuary</a> was afforded protection from thirty to forty days, after which, subject to certain severe <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>, he had to "<a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjure</a> the realm", that is leave the kingdom within a specified <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> and take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> not to return without the king's leave. Violation of the protection of <a href="../cathen/13431a.htm">sanctuary</a> was punishable by <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>.

<p>In some cases there was a stone seat within the church, called the "frith-stool", on which it is said the seeker of <a href="../cathen/13431a.htm">sanctuary</a> had to sit in order to establish his claim to protection. In others, and more commonly, there was a large ring or knocker on the church door, the holding of which gave the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of asylum. Examples of these may been seen at <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, St. Gregory's, <a href="../cathen/11121a.htm">Norwich</a>, and elsewhere.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of <a href="../cathen/13431a.htm">sanctuary</a> ceased in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> at the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, but was after that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> allowed to certain non-ecclesiastical precincts, which afforded shelter chiefly to debtors. The houses of ambassadors were also sometimes quasi-sanctuaries.

<p>Whitefriars, <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> (also called Alsatia), was the last place of <a href="../cathen/13431a.htm">sanctuary</a> used in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but it was abolished by Act of Parliament in 1697. In other <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> countries the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of <a href="../cathen/13431a.htm">sanctuary</a> ceased towards the end of the eighteenth century.
