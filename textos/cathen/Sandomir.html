<h1>Sandomir</h1>  

<p>(Polish, <em>Sandomierz</em>; <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>, <em>Sandomiriensis</em>).

<p>The city is very ancient, with still existing traces of prehistoric construction. Its population is 6891, of which 2364 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 46 of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, and 3433 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.

<p>When King Mieczyslaw I (962-92), introduced <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> into <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> he built two churches at Sandomir dedicated to <a href="../cathen/11063b.htm">St. Nicholas</a> and <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the city became an important centre of political and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. Here lived several illustrious and holy personages, namely, the Blessed Salome (1210-68), daughter of Leszek the Fair and wife of Koloman I, King of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>; Blessed Adelaide, daughter of Casimir the Just (1179-94), King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, who founded the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. John where she was buried (1211); Blessed Vincent Kladubek, who died in 1223 after a fruitful apostolic ministry and was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a>; Blessed Czeslaw, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> (d. 1242 or 1247), the brother of <a href="../cathen/07591b.htm">St. Hyacinth</a>, his cult was approved throughout <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> by <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a> in 1735; <a href="../cathen/07591b.htm">St. Hyacinth</a>; the celebrated and apostolic <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> who was one of the glories of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>; <a href="../cathen/04569a.htm">St. Cunegunde</a> (1224-92), wife of Boleslaw the Chaste King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. In 1260 Tatar hordes completely destroyed the city and put all the inhabitants to the sword. Forty-nine <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> with Sadok, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. James, were <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a>. In 1476 Jan Dlugosz, the celebrated <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalist</a> and Polish historian, a canon of Cracow and Sandomir, built here for the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> a house which is still existing and is called by his name.

<p>The Congress of Sandomir (1570) was assembled for the purpose of union between <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> and the foundation of a national <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant Church</a>. The results were negative, but certain measures were proposed and approved for the regulation of the relations between the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>.

<p>Up to the second half of the eighteenth century the city of Sandomir and its territory were under the immediate <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Diocese of Cracow. In 1787 through the initiative of Michael Poniatowski, administrator of the Diocese of Cracow, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> created Sandomir a diocese. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Mgr. Adalbert Radozewskl (d. 1796). In 1818, after the Concordat with <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ex imposita nobis", which suppressed the greater part of the <a href="../cathen/08636a.htm">Diocese of Kielce</a> and transferred its episcopal seat to Sandomir. In the next year Mgr. Stephen Holowczyc, dean of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/08636a.htm">Kielce</a>, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The new diocese comprised the ancient Principality of Sandomir, which is now the Province of Radom, and part of the Province of <a href="../cathen/08636a.htm">Kielce</a>. Bishop Holowczyc had scarcely taken possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> before he was made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, Adam Prosper Burzynski, succeeded him in 1820. After the death of Bishop Burzynski (9 Sept., 1830) the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter administered the diocese until 1840, when the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, Clement Bankiewicz, was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at the age of eighty, and died 2 January, 1842. His successor was Bishop Joseph Joachim Goldtman, who had been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15680b.htm">Wladislaw</a> since 1838; he was transferred to the See of Sandomir in 1844, and died on 22 March, 1853. Bishop Joseph Michael Yuszynski, who had occupied various <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, succeeded him, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 10 July, 1859. Under him the number of deaneries of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was decreased from seventeen to seven. On his death Bishop Anthony Francis Sotkiewicz, administrator of the <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Archdiocese of Warsaw</a> and professor of canon law in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> of that city, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 20 May, 1882; d. 4 May, 1901. At the time of his elevation the number of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> was 278, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population 730,940. He was succeeded on 4 September, 1902, by Stephen Alexander Zwierowicz, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>, who was transferred from the latter see to Sandomir, where he died on 3 January, 1908. The present incumbent of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is Bishop Marianus Joseph Ryn, canon of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 7 April, 1910. The diocese at present comprises seven deaneries: Sandomir, Opatow, Ibza, Kozienice, Radom, Opoczno, and Konskie. There are six churches in the city of Sandomir; the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which dates from 1120 and to which a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter has been attached since 1818; the Church of St. James, founded in 1200 by Blessed Adelaide; here dwelt Hyacinth and Martin of Sandomir, whom <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> sent as his ambassador to St. Louis, to induce him to undertake a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>; and Raymond Bembnowski, author of the Acts of the Martyrs of Sandomir; the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Conversion of St. Paul, which was in existence in the beginning of the thirteenth century; the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Holy Ghost, founded by the Religious of the Holy Ghost of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> in Sassia in 1222; the Church of St. Michael, founded in 1686 and attached to a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>; and the Church of St. Joseph, founded in 1685 by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. There are 212 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>, 1 collegiate church, 10 detached churches, and 50 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> number 295. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> were all dispersed after the Polish insurrection of 1863. The regulars are represented by one <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Wysmierzyce. The Sisters of Charity, numbering forty-two, have seven <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> at Sandomir, Radom, Strzyzowice, Opatow, Staszow, Opoczno. Near Bodzentyn is a <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloistered</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> with thirteen sisters. The canons of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> number twelve, those of the college, six. There are 870,674 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Amongst the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of Sandomir may be mentioned the Society of Charities, founded in 1905, with 155 members; the archconfraternity of St. Stanislaus Kostka, founded in 1906, with 30 young men; the Christian Working Men's Society, founded in 1907, with 98 members, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Society, founded in 1908 with 188 members.
