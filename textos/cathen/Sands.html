<h1>Sands</h1>  

<h2>Benjamin F. Sands</h2>

<p>Rear-admiral United States Navy, b. at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, Md., 11 Feb., 1812; d. at Washington, D.C., 30 June, 1883. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were non-Catholics and he became a convert in 1850, having married a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, Henrietta M. French, sister of Major-General William H. French, U.S.A. He was appointed a midshipman in the navy from his native state, 1 April, 1828, and passed through the successive grades of promotion until he received the rank of rear-admiral, 27 April, 1871, and was placed on the retired list on reaching the age of 62 years, 11 February, 1874. During the Civil War he held several important commands with conspicuous success, and in 1867 was made superintendent of the Naval Observatory at Washington. During his incumbency of this office, which lasted until 1874, he advanced the observatory to a place equal to the most celebrated in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. For many years he was a member of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian Bureau in Washington. Notes he left were compiled by his son, F. B. Sands, into the book "From Reefer to Rear Admiral". His son George H. graduated at West Point and served in the U. S. Army. Three others, William F., F. B., and James H., also served in the navy; a daughter, Rosa, became a Visitation <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>.
<h2>James Hoban Sands</h2>

<p>Rear-admiral U.S.N., son of foregoing; b. at Washington, D. C., 12 July, 1845; d. there 26 October, 1911. Following the footsteps of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> he achieved a high reputation in the naval service for daring and seamanship. Appointed to the Naval Academy from <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> in 1859, from which he graduated four years later, he served with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron during the Civil War. While only an ensign he was twice recommended by boards of admirals to be advanced in grade for gallantry. After the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> he had commands in the West <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> Squadron, and later had charge of the Brooklyn, <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, Philadelphia, and Washington Navy Yards. He was made rear-admiral, 11 April, 1902, and commanded at the Naval Academy, 1906-07, introducing a much needed reform in spite of opposition in many quarters. This was his last active <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> as he retired in 1907 after a sea service of eighteen years and four months and a shore <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of twenty-two years. His example as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> was a strong influence in the navy in developing a spirit of tolerance towards <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the service, and in making religious practices of whatever creed more respected. His wife was Mary Elizabeth Meade, of the famous Philadelphia <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of that name, who became a convert. His son William Franklin was <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> Minister to <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>, and two of his daughters, Clara and Hilda, became Religious of the Sacred Heart.
