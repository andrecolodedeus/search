<h1>Sankt P&ouml;lten</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in Lower <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, derives its name and origin from <em>Fanum Sancti Hippolyti</em>, a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> founded there in the ninth century and dedicated to <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">St. Hippolytus</a>. The origin of this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> is obscure. Some think that <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from Lake Tegernsee in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> founded a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> on the Traisen in 791, when <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> united a part of the territory of the Avars with his empire, and Passau took this district as a mission field. In the ninth century Sankt P&ouml;lten was the eastern limit of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian civilization</a>, the only <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> east of the Enns. It is said that the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was transferred to secular canons in 985, and in 1080 the great reformer Altmann of <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a> replaced these by Reformed <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> was Engelbert. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a> attached much importance to the spiritual and material improvement of this important support of their power in the east. Hefele in his "Konziliengeschichte" (VI, pt. II, 230-2) gives the decisions of the synod that Bishop Gottfried of <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a> held at Sankt P&ouml;lten in 1284. These were of importance: if a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> celebrates solemnly the wedding of his son or his daughter, he is to be suspended; the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, vicars, and <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> must confess their more serious <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to the dean, the latter to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>; everyone may confess less serious <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and negligences to whom he will. Annates are mentioned even at this early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>; "the first year of the episcopal collation of vacant churches is used for the church at <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a>". Another synod was held at Sankt P&ouml;lten ten years later.

<p>Soon after this (1306) the city came very near destruction. As in other places stories were current of sacrilegious acts of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, especially of pierced and bleeding Hosts. These tales led to the founding of churches of the Sacred Blood; and at Sankt P&ouml;lten, as elsewhere, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were robbed and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a>. Only the intercession of Bishop Wernhart prevailed upon King Albert I not to destroy the city. When the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> began, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a> was not strong enough to withstand it; in 1565 there were only three canons. Aid, however, was given by <a href="../cathen/08666b.htm">Klesl</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, through whose efforts many citizens were converted. Part of one of <a href="../cathen/08666b.htm">Klesl's</a> sermons is preserved in the city archives: "Behold, for a thousand years the pictures of your forefathers holding <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">rosaries</a> in their hands have stood in this church". In 1706 the first settlement of the <a href="../cathen/08054a.htm">Institute of Mary</a> was made at Sankt P&ouml;lten, whence they had been called from <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> by the vice-president of the Government of Lower <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, Jakob Freiherr von Kriechbaum. At the same time <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> settled there. They were later suppressed by the <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a>, and the same fate befell the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian canons</a>. The fifty-ninth and last <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> was Ildefons Schmidtbauer. The emperor took the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for the episcopal residence and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> church for the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. As the Diocese of Wiener-Neustadt reached almost to the capital, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> united its territory with the <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Archdiocese of Vienna</a>, and transferred its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to Sankt P&ouml;lten. A new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was established at <a href="../cathen/09273a.htm">Linz</a> and both <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were made suffragans of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>.

<p>Since 1785 Sankt P&ouml;lten has had thirteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, each episcopate averaging less than ten years. A popular tradition relating that the last <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> had predicted that no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> would reign over ten years was, however, disproved by the tenth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Feigerle, who reigned eleven years. Some of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have been very distinguished: Sigismund, Count Hohenwart, who was tutor of the Emperor Francis and the Archduke Charles and became Prince <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>; the court preachers Jakob Frint, Michael Wagner, and Ignaz Feigerle; above all <a href="../cathen/06051a.htm">Joseph Fessler</a>, the learned professor, skilful diplomatist, and secretary of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> (d. 1872). In 1836 Johann Leonhard resigned the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. At present the diocese has two <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> for boys, which train candidates for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. <a href="../cathen/06051a.htm">Fessler</a> united one of these <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> with the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Seitenstetten; the other was established at <a href="../cathen/10167a.htm">Melk</a> by the present Bishop Johann R&ouml;ssler. In 1908 R&ouml;ssler held the first <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod of the independent Bishopric of Sankt P&ouml;lten; the important constitutions and acts of this synod have been printed. The Diocese of Sankt P&ouml;lten contains 620,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; 479 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>; 505 members of male orders in 16 houses; and 874 members of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> orders in 94 branch houses.
