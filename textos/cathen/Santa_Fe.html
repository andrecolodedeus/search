<h1>Santa Fe</h1>  

<p>(SANCTAE FIDEI IN AMERICA).

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a>, erected by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1850 and created an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> in 1875. It comprised at first the three territories of <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a>, <a href="../cathen/04129a.htm">Colorado</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01719a.htm">Arizona</a>, detached from the <a href="../cathen/05208c.htm">Diocese of Durango, Mexico</a>. Since 1868 it has been restricted to the larger portion of <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a>. Suffragans: the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/15084b.htm">Tucson</a> and <a href="../cathen/04733c.htm">Denver</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> number about 150,000, of whom 12,000 are <a href="../cathen/12554b.htm">Pueblo Indians</a> (Tiguex and Quirix); the majority of the remainder are of Spanish descent. There are (1911) 50 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches and 350 mission <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, most of them built or thoroughly repaired since 1852; these are attended by 70 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 50 seculars, and 20 regulars (<a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>); each <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is a missionary in charge of from six to ten scattered missions, some of them very far apart. Of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, there is but one native; the others are French, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a>, German, and Italian. Their ministerial work is governed by the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Baltimore Council</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>; they have ecclesiastical conferences and annual retreats; they form also among themselves a Clergy Relief Union, incorporated, and they are aided by 160 religious: <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>, Sisters of Loretto, of Charity; of the Most <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, of St. Francis, and of the Sorrowful Mother.

<p>Despite the increase in recent years of English-speaking people and the exclusive teaching of English in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, the diocese at large still is a Spanish-American community. The assimilation of Mexicans and Indians with the Americans, desired by some and dreaded by many, is an arduous task. All the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> speak both English and Spanish, besides other languages; but Spanish today is and must be used in the confessional and from the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a>, except in a few cities (Santa Fe, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, Raton, and Roswell) where both languages are used. Likewise some of the old Spanish customs are retained, such as the administration of <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">confirmation</a> to infants. "Roma non objiciente", the privileges of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in regard to fast and abstinence are still in vogue, and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> live on the offerings of the faithful without regular salaries. Education, when the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was erected, was limited to the teaching in <a href="../cathen/14192a.htm">Spanish</a> exclusively, of the primary elements of religion, reading, and writing, by either the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or lay teachers. Today there are in the archdiocese: a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for boys (Santa Fe); a high school (Albuquerque); eight academies for young ladies; two boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for Indians; <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in Santa Fe, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, Bernalillo, Jemez, Pe&ntilde;a Blanca, Folsom, Goswell, and Gallup, with an average, daily increasing, of 4000 children under <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> care, despite the poverty of the people, and the moneyed competition of the <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> and <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodist</a> missions, which have selected <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a> as a field of operation. There is also in the diocese an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> for girls, and four sanatoria with <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> annexed, conducted by sisters, at <a href="../cathen/13457a.htm">Santa Fe</a>, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, and Roswell. The flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is due to the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of: Archbishop Lamy (1850-85); Archbishop Salpointe (1885-94); Archbishop Chapelle (1894-97); Archbishop Bourgade (1898-1908) who built the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/15084b.htm">Tucson</a>; and Archbishop Pitaval (1909); and of the pioneers: Very Rev. P Eguillon, Revs. G. J. Macheboeuf (afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04733c.htm">Denver</a>), J. B. Salpointe, Gabriel Ussel, J. M. Coudert, A. Truchard, J. B. Ralli&egrave;re, J. B. Fayet, J. Fialon, C. Seux, A. Fourchegu etc.

<p>The relations between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> authorities are harmonious. Mass is said and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> taught at the penitentiary and at the Government Indian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; at every Legislature a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is chosen for <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> and in nearly all country <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> the teachers are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.
