<h1>Santander</h1>  

<p>(SANCTI ANDERII, SANTANDERIENSIS).

<p>This diocese in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> takes its name not from St. Andrew as some, misled by the sound of the name, believe, but from St. Hemeterius (Santemter, Santenter, Santander), one of the patrons of the city and ancient <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, the other being St. Celedonius. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is bounded on the north by the Bay of Biscay, on the east by Vizcaya and <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, on the south by <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a> and Palencia, on the west by Leon and <a href="../cathen/11363a.htm">Oviedo</a>. It is suffragan of <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, and comprises most of the civil Province of Santander and parts of those of Alava and <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>. In Roman times Santander was called Portus Victoriae, in memory of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#IV">Agrippa's</a> having conquered it from the Cantabrians, and in the period of the reconquest was regarded as one of the Asturias&mdash;Asturias de Sant Ander, between the Rivers Saja and Miesa. The territory was repeopled by Alfonso I, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Alfonso II, the Chaste, founded there the Abbey of Sts. Hemeterius and Celedonius, where the heads of those <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were kept. Alfonso VII, the Emperor, made it a collegiate church. As early as 1068, King Sancho II, the Strong, granted a charter to the Abbey and port of St. Hemeterius in reward for services, and Alfonso V did as much. Alfonso VIII gave the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> the lordship of the town on 11 July, 1187. In the fourteenth century the canons were still living in community in this <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and Abbot Nuno Perez, chancellor to Queen Maria, drew up constitutions for them; these constitutions were confirmed by King Fernando IV in 1312, and later by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>. The town of Santander aided King St. Ferdinand when he conquered Seville; it broke the iron chains with which the Guadalquiver had been closed, by ramming them with a ship&mdash;which is the armorial blazon of the city.

<p>Santander did not become an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> until the reign of Fernando VI. By a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 12 December, 1754, <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> confirmed the creation of the See of Santander, making the collegiate church a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and giving it territory taken from the <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Archdiocese of Burgos</a>. In 1755 Fernando VI raised the town to the rank of a city. The last Abbot and first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Santander was Francisco Javier de Arriaza, a native of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, who took possession in 1755 and ruled until 1761. The Province of Santander was formed in 1801, and in 1816 became an independent <em>intendencia</em> and one of the provinces in the definitive political organization (see <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">SPAIN</a>). The city at present has a population of 54,700 and is one of the most important harbors on the Bay of Biscay. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is a structure of very diverse periods, and at one time had the character of a fortress. Its lower portion contains a spacious <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a>, called the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of Christ because it serves <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> uses. The dark and sombre character of the structure marks its original purpose of a pantheon. It consists of three <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a> with three <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apses</a> forming as many <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> has been erected in it. The building dates from the twelfth or early thirteenth century, but presents added features of many later periods. A spiral staircase, constructed in the wall, leads from the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> properly so called, to which the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> of the old <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> serves as <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">vestibule</a>, opening on the principal street (Rue Mayor) of the city. The church itself, exclusive of the <em>capilla mayor</em>, is formed of three <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a> of unequal height, 128.5 feet in length and 59.5 feet in width. In the choir is buried the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Pedro Luis Manso y Luniga (d. 1669), who had it built. In a corner of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> on the Gospel side is a holy-water font of Arabic workmanship probably brought as a memorial of the conquest from C&oacute;rdoba where it served as a <a href="../cathen/02334a.htm">basin</a> for ablutions; it bears a very poetical Arabic inscription, which has been translated by Don Pascal Gayangos. The <em>capilla mayor</em>, or principal <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, was built late in the seventeenth century by Abbot Manuel Francisco de Navarrete y Ladr&oacute;n de Guevara (1695-1705). The <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> Sts. Hemeterius and Celedonius are kept in the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>. On the south is a <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> which long served as a cemetery; and in the south-eastern corner was the Chapel of the Holy Ghost, the last remains of the hospice founded by Abbot Nu&ntilde;o P&eacute;rez Monroy, counsellor to Dona Maria de Molina in the distracted reigns of Fernando IV and Alfonso XI.

<p>The other <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of Santander are: San Francisco, an ancient <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>, facing on the Plaza de Becedo; Consolaci&oacute;n; the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, connected with the old <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>; the new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Santa Lucia. Among the benevolent institutions are: the civil and military <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of San Rafael, built in 1791 by Bishop Rafael Tom&aacute;s Menendez de Luarca; the House of Charity; the Asylum of San Jos&eacute;, for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of poor boys; the Casa Cuna (foundling <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>); the provincial <em>inclusa</em> (<a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">foundling asylum</a>), founded in 1778 by Bishop Francisco Laso de San Pedro. The intermediate <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, Institute de Segunda Ense&ntilde;anza, has been established in the old <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of St Clare since 1839; and the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> since 1852 in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Santa Catalina de Monte Corb&aacute;n, formerly <a href="../cathen/07345a.htm">Hieronymite</a>, a short distance from the city. There is also the pontifical <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Comillas, founded by Antonio Lopez, Marqu&eacute;s de Comillas, placed under the care of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>, and raised to the rank of a pontifical <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. The distinguished men whom this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has produced are numberless; among them may be mentioned: St. Beatus, of Li&eacute;bana, Fray Antonio de Guevara, Juan de Herrera, Amador de los Rios, and Pereda.
