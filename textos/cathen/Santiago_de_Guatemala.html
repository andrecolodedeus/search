<h1>Santiago de Guatemala</h1>  

<p>(Sancti Jacobi majoris de Guatemala)

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> conterminous with the Republic of Guatemala, in Central America. It is bounded on the north by the State of <a href="../cathen/15737b.htm">Yucat&aacute;n</a> in Mexico, the British colony of Belize, and the Gulf of <a href="../cathen/07449b.htm">Honduras</a>; on the east by the Republics of <a href="../cathen/07449b.htm">Honduras</a> and Salvador; on the south by the Pacific Ocean; on the west by the States of <a href="../cathen/03652b.htm">Chiapas</a> and <a href="../cathen/14423b.htm">Tabasco</a> in Mexico. Its area is 28,950 square miles. Santiago de Guatemala was made a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> 18 December, 1534, its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> being Don Francisco Marroquin, who came from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> with the adelantado or governor, <a href="../cathen/01372d.htm">Don Pedro de Alvarado</a>. The episcopal line of succession is as follows: (2) Bernardino de Villalpando, (3) G&oacute;mez Fern&aacute;ndez de C&oacute;rdova, (4) Juan Ram&iacute;rez de Arellano, (5) Juan Cabezas Altamirano, (6) Juan Zapata y Sandoval, (7) Agust&iacute;n de Ugartey Saravia, (8) Bartolom&eacute; Gonz&aacute;lez* Soltero, (9) Payo Enr&iacute;quez de Rivera, (10) Juan de Santo Mat&iacute;a S&aacute;enz Ma&ntilde;ozca y <a href="../cathen/10644a.htm">Murillo</a>, (11) Juan de Ortega y Monta&ntilde;ez, (12) Andr&eacute;s de las Navas y Quevedo, (13) Mauro de Larre&aacute;tegui y Col&oacute;n, (14) Juan Bautista Alvarez de Toledo, (15) Nicol&aacute;s Carlos G&oacute;mez de Cervantes, (16) Juan G&oacute;mez de Parada. On 16 December, 1743, the Diocese of Guatemala was raised to <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> rank by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/11046a.htm">Nicaragua</a> and Comayagua (Honduras) being assigned to it as suffragans. The <a href="../cathen/13450b.htm">Diocese of San Salvador</a>, erected by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, 28 September, 1842, and that of <a href="../cathen/13446a.htm">San Jos&eacute; de Costa Rica</a>, erected in 1850, were also added to these suffragans, so that the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> church of Santiago de Guatemala has four suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, which are, in the order of their erection: Nicaragua, <a href="../cathen/07449b.htm">Honduras</a>, <a href="../cathen/13450b.htm">San Salvador</a>, and Costa Rica. With the archdiocese, they constitute the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Province of Central America. The series of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> since the erection of the archdiocese, in 1743, is (1) Pedro Pardo de Figueroa, (2) Francisco Jos&eacute; de Figueredo y Victoria, (3) Pedro Cortez y Larraz, (4) Cayetano Francos y Monroy, (5) Juan F&eacute;lix de Villegas, (6) Luis Pe&ntilde;alver y C&aacute;rdenas, (7) Rafael de la Vara de la <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, (8) Ram&oacute;n Casaus y Torres, (9) Francisco de Paula Garc&iacute;a Pelaez, (10) Bernardo Pi&ntilde;ol y Aycinena, (11) Ricardo Casanova y Estrada. <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> being now separated, there is no official relation between the two. By the twenty-fourth article of the Constitution of the Republic, the free exercise of all forms of religion, with no pre-eminence for any one form, is guaranteed, but only within their respective places of worship.

<p>Formerly, there existed in this archdiocese communities of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Friars Preachers</a> (Dominicans), Minor Observantines of St. Francis, Recollect and <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> Missionaries, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratory of St. Philip Neri</a>, and the Priests of the Mission of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>. There were also <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities of the following <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> orders: <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/04190c.htm">Conceptionists</a>, Catarinas, Belemites, Rosas, and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, besides the Religious of the Institute of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> engaged in the service of <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and the teaching of poor children; these Sisters are employed in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> of the city of Guatemala, of Quezaltenango, and of Antigua Guatemala. There is but one <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> college, the Colegio de Infantes, for the choir- and altar-boys of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Santa Iglesia. It has fifteen professors and two inspectors, and numbers (1908) 47 intern and 102 extern pupils. The Sisters of Charity conduct in the Casa Central of the city of Guatemala a teaching establishment which, during the year 1908, had 98 girls as interns and gave instruction to 750 girls and 160 boys as externs; in the same year the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> at the capital, conducted by religious of the same institute, sheltered 190 male and 112 <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> of more advanced age, besides 35 infants of both sexes. In the Asilo Santa Mar&iacute;a these Sisters had under their care 90 girl interns. There is also in the city of Guatemala the Colegio San Agust&iacute;n, an establishment for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of older boys, conducted by a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a>, with 329 pupils; in the city are nine girls' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in which religious instruction and training are given. By the eighteenth article of the Fundamental Law, the teaching in the national institutes, colleges, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> is entirely secular and gratuitous. The 101 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the archdiocese are grouped, for purposes of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration, into sixteen vicariates forain. The capital contains four <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, each served by a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (<em>cura</em>) and an assistant (<em>vicario</em>); there are also 19 churches in the city under a <em>presb&iacute;terio <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a></em>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> consists of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, the chapter (six dignitaries: dean, archdean, cantor, schoolmaster, treasurer, and magistral), a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/13322a.htm">sacristan</a> in chief, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> master of ceremonies, six choir <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, and a sub-cantor. The administrative organization of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> consists of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, and private and administrative secretary; in addition to these the treasurer-general and two <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> registrars are members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> curia. In 1908 the archdiocese had 120 secular and 12 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. According to the census of 1902, the denominational statistics of the republic were: <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 1,422,933; Protestants, 2254; professing other <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, 1146; of no religion, 5113. By the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 15 November, 1879, the cemeteries were absolutely secularized, and their construction, administration, and inspection subjected exclusively to municipal authority. There is an archdiocesan <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for the formation of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, governed by a <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, a vice-rector, a <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>, several prefects and professors; in 1908 it had 16 students.
