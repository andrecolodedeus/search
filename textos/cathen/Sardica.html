<h1>Sardica</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> of Dacia Mediterranea. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> name of the city (now Sophia, the capital of <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>) was Serdica, the city of the Serdi, a Thracian people defeated by Crassus in 29 B.C. and subjected to the Kingdom of Thrace, the vassal of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. When this kingdom was suppressed in 49 B.C. the Serdi were included in the Roman Province of Thracia. The <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Emperor Trajan</a> transformed the borough of the Serdi into a city which he called Ulpia Serdica. In 275 <a href="../cathen/02108b.htm">Aurelian</a> caused Dacia beyond the Danube to be evacuated, and transplanted to Moesia and Thracia the soldiers and colonists who were faithful to the Roman cause. The country occupied by these immigrants formed the new Province of Dacia, Sardica being included in this province (Homo, "Essai sur le r&egrave;gne de l'empereur Aur&eacute;lien," 313-21). Later, <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> divided Dacia into Dacia Ripensis and Dacia Mediterranea. Sardica was the civil and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of the latter. <a href="../cathen/06366a.htm">Gallienus</a> established a mint at Sardica, and <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>, who was born in the region, contemplated making it his capital. Ecclesiastically, Sardica belonged to the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> until 733, when it was annexed to that of Constantinople until 809. Upon the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>, in 865, Sardica was one of the first cities which had a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Until 1204 it was included in the Graeco-Bulgarian Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/01103b.htm">Achrida</a>, until 1393 in the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> Patriarchate of Tirnovo, and until 1872 in that of Constantinople. Since then Sardica, or, as it is now called, Sophia, belongs to the national Church of <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>. The earliest known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Protagenes, who assisted at the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> in 325; the best known is Bonosus, who shortly afterwards attacked the virginity of the Blessed Virgin. (For the council held here in the fourth century see <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">COUNCIL OF SARDICA</a>.)

<p>Although taken by <a href="../cathen/02061b.htm">Attila</a> and often destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, the town remained under Byzantine dominion until 809, when it was captured by the Bulgars, who changed its name to Sredetz, later transformed by the Greeks into Sraditza and Triaditza. Again occupied by the Greeks from 1018 to 1186, it enjoyed great prosperity; a section of the population was <a href="../cathen/11583b.htm">Paulician</a> or <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaean</a>. After some years of troubles it again fell into the power of the Bulgars. Its present name of Sophia dates from the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, though the precise date of its first use cannot be assigned. In the sixteenth century Sredetz and Sophia were used simultaneously. In 1382 the city was captured by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, and for more than four centuries it was the residence of the <em>beglerbeg</em>, or governor general, of Rumelia. In 1878 Sophia was chosen as the capital of the Principality of <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, and since 1908 has been the capital of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>. A <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> was created here at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> and confided to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. In 1610 <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> reestablished the See of Sophia, which in 1643 was made <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a>. It was suppressed towards the end of the eighteenth century, because the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and had <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a>, mostly to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Relative peace was restored in 1835, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> confided the direction of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, under a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> who had not received episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> were replaced by the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> in 1841, their superior being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1848. At present an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> is at the head of this <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a>. Sophia has 105,000 inhabitants, of whom a small number are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> have a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> there, and the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of the Apparition three <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>.
