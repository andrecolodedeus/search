<h1>Sassari</h1>  

<p>(TURRITANA)

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, situated on the River Rossello in a fertile region: a centre of the oil, fruit, wine, and tobacco industries. The city has a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> founded in 1634. There is a monument to the Duke of Maurienne in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Most <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a> contains a beautiful picture by an unknown artist of the Quattrocento. Other noteworthy buildings are the palace of the Duke of Vallombrosa, the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragonese</a> castle with its high tower, the Fontana del Rossello and a thirteenth-century wall. Sassari was unknown till about the eleventh century; it developed with the decay of the ancient Torres (<em>Turris Lybissonis</em>), which till then had been the principal city on the island. It was sacked by the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> in 1166. In 1291 it became a republic with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a>, who were pleased to see it thus withdrawn from the control of the <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisans</a>. Its <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of 1316 are remarkable for the leniency of the penalties imposed when compared with the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. In 1390 it was united to the <em>giudicatura</em> of Arborea, of which it became the capital, but in 1420 it fell into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragonese</a>. In 1527 it was sacked by the French. The <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> of Sassari commences with that of Torres. In 304 the soldier Gavinus, Protus a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> <a href="../cathen/08295a.htm">Januarius</a> suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> there. Later Gavinus and Protus were reputed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and said to have lived in the second and third centuries respectively. <a href="../cathen/06393c.htm">St. Gaudentius</a>, who seems to have belonged to the beginning of the fourth century, is also <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> there. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> whose date is known is Felix (404). Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>: Marinianus, a contemporary of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>; Novellus (685), whose <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> caused a controversy between <a href="../cathen/08422c.htm">John V</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03139c.htm">Cagliari</a>; Felix (727), who took refuge at <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> to escape the cruelty of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>; almost nothing is known concerning <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Torres for the next three centuries, till Simon (1065). His successor, Costantino de Crasta (1073), was an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Other <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>: Blasius (1199), representative of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, on several occasions; Stefano, O.P. (1238), <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> in <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> and <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>; Trogodario (about 1278) who erected the episcopal palace in Sassari, to which Teodosio (1292) added the Church of St. Andrea; after this the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> resided habitually at Sassari. Pietro Spano (1422) was a restorer of discipline; under him the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> was definitively transferred to Sassari by <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a>. This <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> intended to erect a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for the training of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, but his death frustrated the plan. Angelo Leonini (1509) was at the <a href="../cathen/09018b.htm">Fifth Lateran Council</a>; Salvatore Salepusi (1553) was distinguished at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>; Alfonso de Sorca (1585), highly esteemed by <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>. At about the year 1500 there were united to the Archdiocese of Sassari the Sees of Sorca (<em>Saralapsis</em>) which is mentioned as a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in 1106, and whose last <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Jacopo Poggi; and of Ploaghe (<em>Plubium</em>), the first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of which is Jacentius (1090). The sees suffragan to Sassari are: <a href="../cathen/01310d.htm">Alghero</a>, <a href="../cathen/01440a.htm">Ampurias</a> and Tempio, <a href="../cathen/02581a.htm">Bisarchio</a>, Bosa. The archdiocese contains 35 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 140 secular; 41 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular priests</a>: 112,500 inhabitants, 9 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of religious, and 13 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, 7 boys', and 5 girls' institutions.
