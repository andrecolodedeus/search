<h1>Sault Sainte Marie</h1>  

<p>(SANCTAE-MARIAE-ORMENSIS)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> erected by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 16 September, 1904. It embraces the southern parts of the districts of Thunder Bay, Algoma, and Nipissing (i.e. between the height of land and the Lakes Superior <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a>, and Nipissing. The Recollects were the first missionaries in the Nipissing region. Father Guillaume Poullain (1622) and Jacques de la Foyer (1624) spent a few months there and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> several children on the point of death. However, Father Claude Pijart, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, was the principal apostle of the <a href="../cathen/01311b.htm">Algonquins</a> at Nipissing and around Georgian Bay. He devoted to their conversion nine years of indefatigable <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> (1641-50), being aided in his work by <a href="../cathen/12669b.htm">Father Charles Raymbault</a> (1641-42), Ren&eacute; Maynard (1641-44; 1648-50), L&eacute;onard Gareau (1644-46), <a href="../cathen/12228b.htm">Joseph Poncet</a> (1646-50), Adrien Daran (1649-50). They were the first who preached the Gospel to the tribes of the Manitoulin Islands and Georgian Bay as far as Sault Sainte Marie. As early as 1641 Fathers Jogues and <a href="../cathen/12669b.htm">Raymbault</a> had visited the latter place. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> established three missions in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/01311b.htm">Algonguins</a> of this country: St-Esprit, St-Charles and St-Pierre. Their ministry was not altogether fruitless: travelling to Lake Nipigon, in 1667, <a href="../cathen/01326b.htm">Father Allouez</a> found some of their <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> who had stood firm in the Faith, although they had not seen a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for nearly twenty years. The ruin of the <a href="../cathen/01311b.htm">Algonquin</a> missions accompanied the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> nation. In 1668 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> founded the mission of Sault Sainte Marie. From this centre they evangelized the adjacent country, and pushed their apostolic expeditions as far as the regions of the Nipissirinians. Well-known among the apostles of this period are Fathers <a href="../cathen/05164a.htm">Gabriel Druillettes</a>, Louis Andr&eacute;, Henri Nouvel, and <a href="../cathen/02207a.htm">Pierre Bailloquet</a>. In the beginning of the eighteenth century, the founding of <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a> caused the centre of the western missions to be transferred eastward; those of Georgian Bay were abandoned, being resumed only in 1836, when Rev. Jean Baptiste Proulx, a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, settled in Manitoulin Island. In 1838 another <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> Father Pierz, founded the missions of Grand Portage, Michipicoton, etc. Hardly had the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> returned to the country, when the evangelization of the savages of what is now New Ontario was entrusted to their care. In 1844 they replaced Father Proulx at Wikwemikong, founded Garden River in 1846, and two years later erected at Rivi&egrave;re aux Tourtes (Pigeon River), a mission which they transferred in 1849 to Fort William. From these different stations they bore the consolations of religion, not only to the Indians, but also to the miners and woodcutters scattered along the shores of Lakes <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> and <a href="../cathen/14336a.htm">Superior</a>. Among the new missionaries Fathers Chon&eacute;, Hanipaux, Duranquet, H&eacute;bert, and Baxter are to be mentioned.

<p>In 1874 <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, adding to the territory already described the districts of Parry Sound, created the Vicariate Apostolic of Northern <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, with Msgr. Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Jamot as its first titular. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the new vicariate numbered 8500. A few other districts were added in 1882, when the Vicariate Apostolic became the <a href="../cathen/11756b.htm">Diocese of Peterborough</a>. The construction of the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> Pacific Railway opened these regions to progress and brought thither numbers of workmen and colonists. Msgr. Jamot called in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and opened to their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> the eastern country extending from North Bay to Sudbury, and later the country as far as Bonheur (a stretch of 800 miles). At its erection the Diocese of Sault Sainte Marie had a fixed population of 26,064 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 20,090 of whom were <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a>, the rest being of different nationalities. There were besides 5000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indians. Today (1911) the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> number 37,875, including 24,470 <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has 50 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 3 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 30 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and 50 missions. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system is the same as that of the <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Province of Ontario</a> (see <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">ONTARIO</a>). The Daughters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (from <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>) direct the Indian industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and the boarding-school at Wikwemikong. The <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of Saint Joseph</a>, besides many other <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, have at Fort William a boarding-school for the Indians and the whites, and a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Port Arthur. The <a href="../cathen/07031a.htm">Grey Nuns</a> (from Ottawa) have charge of the two <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> of Sudbury and of Sault Sainte Marie, and also a few <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15668a.htm">Daughters of Wisdom</a> direct the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Blind River and Sturgeon Falls. Right Rev. David Joseph Scollard, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was born at Ennismore, <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a>, 4 Nov., 1862, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on 21 December, 1890. He was <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/11756b.htm">Peterborough</a> until his appointment to the rectory of North Bay (1896), and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at <a href="../cathen/11756b.htm">Peterborough</a> on 24 Feb., 1905. He resides temporarily at North Bay.
