<p>DIOCESE OF SAVANNAH (SAVANENSIS)

<p>The Diocese of Savannah comprises the <a href="../cathen/06460a.htm">State of Georgia</a> and was created as such by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, 1850. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Rev. F.X. Gartland, V.G. of Philadelphia, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, 10 September, 1850; died, 20 September, 1854; succeeded by <a href="../cathen/02311a.htm">Rev. John Barry</a> of <a href="../cathen/02078b.htm">Augusta</a>, who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, 2 August, 1857, and died, 21 November, 1859. <a href="../cathen/15363b.htm">Rev. Augustus Verot</a>, Vicar-Apostolic of Florida, was appointed to succeed <a href="../cathen/02311a.htm">Bishop Barry</a> but resigned in 1870 and returned to Florida where he died, 10 June, 1876. Rt. Rev. Ignatius Persico, then in the <a href="../cathen/03630a.htm">Diocese of Charleston</a>, was transferred to Savannah, 11 March, 1870, resigning two years after through ill health. On 27 April, 1873, Rev. William H. Gross, C.SS.R., was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> but transferred to the <a href="../cathen/11293a.htm">Archiepiscopal See of Oregon City</a> in 1885, and was succeeded by the <a href="../cathen/02382a.htm">Rt. Rev. Thomas A. Becker</a>, who was transferred from the <a href="../cathen/15646c.htm">See of Wilmington</a>, 16 May, 1886. He died, 27 July, 1899, and was succeeded by the present incumbent Very Rev. B.J. Keiley. Bishop Keiley was born in 1847; went to <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Petersburg, Va.; entered the Confederate service in 1864; went to St. Charles College, Ellicott City, Md., for a brief period in 1868; went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1869; was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 31 December, 1873; appointed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of New Castle, <a href="../cathen/04692a.htm">Delaware</a>, 24 September, 1873; transferred to rectorship of pro-cathedral, <a href="../cathen/15646c.htm">Wilmington</a>, <a href="../cathen/04692a.htm">Delaware</a>, August, 1880. On the transfer of <a href="../cathen/02382a.htm">Bishop Becker</a> to Savannah in May, 1886, he obtained permission from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to go to that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, where he was made <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Immaculate Conception Church and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, 3 December, 1886. Called to Savannah, 12 July, 1896, he was made <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Savannah, 19 April, 1900, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Cardinal Gibbons, 3 June, 1900, in St. Peter's Cathedral, Richmond.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Savannah is a corporation sole and title to <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> rests in him. A majority of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> are of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> descent, with a few German and French. There is no <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; students are sent to St. Bernard's, Rochester, Dunwoodie, N.Y., and Belmont, N.C. The present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, that of St. John the Baptist, was finished during the administration of the present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> upon the ruins of the one completed by Bishop Gross, destroyed by fire, 6 February, 1898. The cornerstone of the first church of St. John the Baptist was laid, 30 May, 1800. There are academies in Savannah, <a href="../cathen/09507a.htm">M&acirc;con</a>, <a href="../cathen/02078b.htm">Augusta</a>, <a href="../cathen/04149a.htm">Columbus</a> and Washington under the care of the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> and <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>; day colleges for boys: in <a href="../cathen/02078b.htm">Augusta</a>, under the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>; in Savannah, under the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Fathers</a>; and in Atlanta under the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marist Fathers</a>. There is an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> for girls in Savannah, in charge of the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, and for boys, in Washington, in charge of the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>. Hospitals, at Savannah and Atlanta, are under the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>. Under certain restrictions, Mass is said in the Federal <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> at Atlanta, where a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> exercises the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> under a salary from the Government. Under the administration of Bishop Keiley the entire charge of the coloured people has been given to the Fathers of the African Mission, who have established churches in Savannah, Atlanta, and one at <a href="../cathen/09507a.htm">M&acirc;con</a>, adjoining the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Diocesan collections are taken annually. The Eucharistic League is widely established, <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> Conferences and Holy Name Societies are local throughout the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, as well as Sodalities of the Sacred Heart and of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In addition to the orders mentioned there are Sisters of St. Francis for the coloured people at Savannah and Augusta, and <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a> at Savannah. The annual retreats are attended by every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the diocese. The statistics in May, 1911, were: <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, regular and secular, 74; churches with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 19; missions with churches, 14; stations regularly attended, 81; <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 14; colleges, 3; academies, 10; <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 16; white <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 2; coloured, 2; home for aged poor, 1; <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 2; population, 15,583.
