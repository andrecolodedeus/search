<h1>Savona and Noli</h1>  

<p>(SAVONENSIS ET NAULENSIS)

<p>Province of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, on the Gulf of Genoa, having a small but safe harbour. In addition to its maritime trade and ship-building, the population is chiefly engaged in manufactures of steel, glass, delph, majolica, and in the quarrying of lignite and marble. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, dating from 1589, restored in the nineteenth century, has three <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a> and a <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a>; it contains beautiful frescoes by Coghetti. Close by the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is the Sistine chapel, erected by <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>, whose ancestors belonged to Savona. The other churches contain <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of great value. Among the secular buildings the most noteworthy is the Palazzo della Rovere, constructed by <a href="../cathen/13443a.htm">Sangallo</a>; the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of Semini were destroyed when the palace was converted into a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. Savona was formerly called Sabbatia or Savo. In the tenth century its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were counts of <a href="../cathen/13489c.htm">Savona</a>, but later the countship passed to the marquesses of Monferrato (981) and afterwards to the marquesses of Vasto (1084); Savona was even then <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to recognize a certain protectorate of the Republic of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>. From 1191 till 1215 it was a free commune. In 1238 it became subject to <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, but succeeded later on several occasions in gaining its independence (1238-51; 1318-1332; 1335-50). In 1525, the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> through jealousy obstructed its port. In 1745 it was bombarded by the English; the following year it was taken by the King of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, who restored it to <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, whose fortune it thenceforward shared. In 1809 <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> there by the French; he returned thither in 1816 to crown the Madonna della Misericordia. Savona is the birthplace of Popes Sixtus IV and Julian II, and also of the poet Gabriele Chiebrera.

<p>The See of <a href="../cathen/13489c.htm">Savona</a> derives from that of Vadum Sabbatium, now a small village three miles from Savona. The first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Benedict (680); Bishop Bernard in 992 established the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the island of Berzezzi, after the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> had been transferred to Savona; Blessed Amicus (1049) reformed the canons. Grossolanus (1098), previously <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Ferrania, founded by Marquese Boniface of <a href="../cathen/13489c.htm">Savona</a> (1097), was selected as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, but was opposed by others and passed his days in continued turmoil; Blessed Vidone Lomello was present at the Lateran Council of 1179; Ambrogio del Carretto (1191) induced the marquess, his brother, to grant independence to the Commune of <a href="../cathen/13489c.htm">Savona</a>; Blessed Alberto di <a href="../cathen/11134b.htm">Novara</a> had frequent conflicts with the commune, which took possession of the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a>; Enrico Ponsoni (1288) made peace with the neighbouring cities. In 1327 the city adhered to the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> Nicholas V, for which it was put under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> for several years; Antonio Viale, a soldier rather than a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, had trouble with the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a>, who kept him <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> at Noli; later, he avenged himself by having the doge, Antoniotto Adorno, deposed; Vincenzo Viale (1413) was famous for his erudition; Jacopo della Rovere (1504) is said to have died because he was not made a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. In the sixteenth century the Republic of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> destroyed, without compensation, many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and religious places to make way for fortifications. As the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, constructed by Julian II, was amongst these, the canons in 1550, of their own accord, occupied the church of the <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a>, who were absent that day, and the latter were deprived of their church till 1589, when the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was completed. Bishop Gio. Batt. Centurione (1592) was distinguished by his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in introducing reforms; Francesco Spinola (1632) had frequent disputes with the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> government, by whom he was exiled; Domenico M. <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> (1775) restored the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; Vinc. M. Maggiolo (1804) entertained <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> for several years; Agostino M. de' Mari (1833), a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, instituted evangelical works. In 1820 the Diocese of Noli, the ancient Naulum, was united to Savona. That diocese had been separated from Savona in 1239, at the request of the Republic of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Filippo (1248); among his successors may be mentioned the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and gifted <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabite</a> Paolo Andrea Borelli (1700) and Benedetto Solaro, O.P. (1778), a supporter of the <a href="../cathen/12116c.htm">Synod of Pistoia</a>. Savona is suffragan of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> and contains 60 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with 88,000 inhabitants, 170 secular and 75 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 9 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> for boys and 15 for girls.
