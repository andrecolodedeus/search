<h1>Saxe-Altenburg</h1>  

<p>One of the <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxon</a> duchies in the east of <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>; situated on the west frontier of the <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Kingdom of Saxony</a>. It has an area of 511 sq. miles and consists of two parts (separated by the principality of the younger branch of the Reuss <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>), the Ostkreis (254 sq. miles) and the Westkreis (257 sq. miles). It contained 216,312 inhabitants in 1910; 206,508 in 1905, including 5,449 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> (3 per cent), 200,511 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and 131 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The duchy became a separate state in 1826, when in consequence of the extinction of the Saxe-Gotha line (1821), its possessions were divided among the Saxon ducal lines, the territory of Altenburg falling to the Saxe-Hildburghausen line as an independent domain. Duke Ernest II (b. 1871) has ruled since 1902. The present duchy was separated from the former Burgraviate of Altenburg, which belonged to the ancestral estates of the House of Saxe-Meissen, by the partition treaty of 1485, to which is to be traced the division of the princely House of Saxony into the Ernestine Line, ruling over the various Thuringian states, and the Albertine Line, ruling in the Kingdom of Saxony. Altenburg fell to the Ernestine Line. A special Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg was founded in 1603, but, on the extinction of the ruling <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> (1672), the territory fell to Saxe-Gotha.

<p>The inhabitants of the territory constituting the modern duchy were prevailingly <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> from the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> movement. The few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the duchy are mostly immigrants who settled there during the latter half of the nineteenth century; in 1871 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> formed only 0.14 per cent of the population. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> services have been held in the city of Altenburg by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from Leipzig (Kingdom of Saxony) since the third decade of the nineteenth century&mdash;in the beginning only at long intervals. Since 1880 Altenburg has had its own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and today <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> service and religious instruction are held in seven places in the duchy, partly by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from the Principality of Reuss and the neighboring <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> territories. By a <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">Rescript</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> of 27 June, 1869, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the duchy were placed under the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> of 19 Sept., 1877, under the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> in the Kingdom of Saxony. There are no legal provisions governing the relations between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the State, the government usually conforming to the principles observed in the Kingdom of Saxony. The public primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are all <a href="../cathen/09458a.htm">Evangelical-Lutheran</a>; there is a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> private <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> (220 pupils in 1910) in the town of Rositz, to which the State has granted a subsidy since 1909. The erection of a private <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in the city of Altenburg (120 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children under <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to attend <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>) has not yet materialized owing to lack of funds. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are mostly <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">immigrant</a> factory hands.
