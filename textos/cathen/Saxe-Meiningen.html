<h1>Saxe-Meiningen</h1>  

<p>A Saxon-Thuringian duchy. It has an area of 953 sq. miles, and 278,792 inhabitants (1910). In 1905 its population of 268,916 included 4870 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> (2 percent), 262,283 Evangelicals, and 1276 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.

<p>The duchy came into existence in 1681, as the result of the various succession agreements among the seven sons of Duke Ernest the Pious of Saxe-Gotha. Later agreements increased the territory of the duchy, especially that of 1826, when the previously independent Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen was assigned to it (560 sq. miles, with 70,000 inhabitants). In the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Duke Bernard II (d. 1882) was the only Thuringian prince of the Saxon house to adhere to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> or the German Confederation. <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> therefore occupied his territory and had the government transferred to his son, George II (b. 1826), who is still reigning (1911). The heir apparent is Prince Bernard, who married Charlotte, sister of the German Emperor.

<p>In pre-Reformation times the territory of the present Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen belonged to the <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">Diocese of W&uuml;rzburg</a>, to whose care today also the few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the country are committed. The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> caused the disappearance of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>.

<p>In 1808, in consequence of a treaty between Saxe-Meiningen and the then Grand Duchy of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Wolfmannshausen was ceded to Saxe-Meiningen. In the course of the nineteenth century, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> pastoral stations were established at Meiningen, Hildburghausen, Poessneck, and Sonneberg (seat of the celebrated toy industry). The legal statute of the various <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> or stations is regulated by special treaties between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the Government. Before making an appointment, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> presents to the ducal Government a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">Diocese of W&uuml;rzburg</a> provided with the royal <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> <em>titulus mensae</em>, and asks if this cleric is a <em>persona grata</em> to the duke. On the approval of the duke, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> receives episcopal institution, and promises on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> before the ducal Government that he will observe the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the land and faithfully fulfil his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. The State grants a small subsidy towards the payment of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Several districts are attended as a matter of charity by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of neighboring <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. If <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> wish to exercise their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions outside of their appointed district, they must first inform the Evangelical <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> of their intention. In the case of interments, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> must, even within their special district, obtain the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the Evangelical <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> as regards the time. There are no legal ordinances concerning <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. For the establishment in Meiningen of the <a href="../cathen/05053a.htm">Daughters of the Divine Redeemer</a> from <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> notice to the police only was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>.

<p>The primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are <a href="../cathen/09458a.htm">Evangelical Lutheran</a>, although this is not expressly provided for in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Religious instruction for the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> in the minority (and thus for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>) must be provided in a manner deemed sufficient by the representatives of such churches. A public <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> exists at Wolfmannshausen (70 pupils), and a private <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> without state or communal support at Poessneck (since 1883; 31 pupils in 1910). The Primary School Law of 1908 definitively set aside the religious supervision of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and effected a sharp division of church and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; even the supervision of religious instruction no longer pertains to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.
