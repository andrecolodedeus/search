<h1>Saxony</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">The Saxon tribe</h2>

<p>There arose in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> during the third and fourth centuries after Christ the great tribal confederations of the Alamanni; Bavarians, <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringians</a>, <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, Frisians, and Saxons, which took the place of the numerous petty tribes with their popular tribal form of government. With the exceptions of the Saxons all these confederations were ruled by kings; the Saxons were divided into a number of independent bodies under different chiefs, and in time of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> they elected a duke. The Saxons (Lat., <em>Saxones</em>) were originally a small tribe living on the North Sea between the Elbe and Eider Rivers in the present Holstein. Their name, derived from their weapon called Sax, a stone knife, is first mentioned by the Roman author Claudius Ptolem&aelig;us (about 130 A.D.). In the third and fourth centuries the Saxons fought their way victoriously towards the west, and their name was given to the great tribal confederation that stretched towards the west exactly to the former boundary of the Roman Empire, consequently almost to the Rhine. Only a small strip of land on the right bank of the Rhine remained to the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> tribe. Towards the south the Saxons pushed as far as the Harz Mountains and the Eichsfeld, and in the succeeding centuries absorbed the greater part of <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>. In the east their power extended at first as far as the Elbe and Saale Rivers; in the later centuries it certainly extended much farther. All the coast of the German Ocean belonged to the Saxons excepting that west of the Weser, which the Frisians retained. The history of the powerful Saxon tribe is also the history of the conversion to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> of that part of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> which lies between the Rhine and the Oder, that is of almost the whole of the present Northern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. From the eighth century the Saxons were divided into the four sub-divisions: <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalians</a>, between the Rhine and Weser; the Engern or Angrians, on both sides of the Weser; the Eastphalians, between the Weser and Elbe; the Transalbingians, in the present Holstein. The only one of these names that has been preserved is <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalians</a>, given to the inhabitants of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Province of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>.

<p>In company with the German tribe of Angles a part of the Saxons settled on the Island of Britain from which the Romans had withdrawn, where as Anglo-Saxons, after having accepted <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> about 600, they laid the foundation of Anglo-Saxon civilization and the present Great Britain. In attempting to reach Gaul by land the Saxons came into violent conflict with the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> living on the Rhine. The <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> king <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a> (481-511) united the various <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> tribes, conquered Roman Gaul, and with his people accepted <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom was able to bring all German tribes except the Saxons under its authority and to make them <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. For more than a hundred years there was almost uninterrupted <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> between <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frank</a> and Saxon. Many Anglo-Saxon <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missionaries sought to convert the Saxons, some were killed, some driven away; the names of only a few of these men have been preserved, as <a href="../cathen/14328b.htm">St. Suitbert</a>, St. Egnert, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> called Brother Ewald, St. Lebuin, etc. <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> also preached without success among the Saxons. The Saxons were finally brought under <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> supremacy by the great <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> ruler, <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, after a bloody struggle that lasted thirty years (772-804). <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> was also able to win them to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, the Saxons being the last German tribe that still held persistently to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the Germanic gods. At different times the Saxon <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> have been called "religious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>" and the assertion, which cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, has been made that Pope Adrian had called upon <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> to convert the Saxons by force. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> campaigns were intended mainly to punish the Saxons for their annual marauding expeditions to the Rhine, in which they burned churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, killed the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and sacrificed their <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> to the gods. The earliest date at which it can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> had the conquest of the Saxon districts in view is 776. It is evident that if peace was to be permanent the overthrow of the Saxons must be accompanied by their conversion to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The necessity for this was based also on the nature of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom in which politics and religion were never separated. At the same time it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that various measures taken by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, as the execution of 4500 Saxons at <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a> in 782 and the hard <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> issued to the subjugated, were shortsighted and cruel. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, however, cannot be made responsible in any case for this policy of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> which it never approved. Although the opposition in Saxon territories to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian teaching</a> had been obstinate only a few decades before, the Saxons grew accustomed to the new life. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> conception of life sank deep into the hearts of the people, and in little more than a hundred years the Saxons were the messengers and defenders of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, German civilization among the Slavonic tribes. The work of converting Saxony was given to St. Sturmi, who was on terms of friendship with <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> founded by Sturmi. Among the successful missionaries of the Faith were also St. Willihad, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, and his Anglo-Saxon companions. After St. Sturmi's death (779) the country of the Saxons was divided into missionary districts, and each of these placed under a <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Parishes were established within the old judicial districts. With the generous aid of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> and his nobles large numbers of churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were founded, and as soon as peace and quiet had been re-established in the different districts, permanent <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were founded.
<h3>The medieval Duchy of Saxony</h3>

<p>When the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom was divided by the Treaty of Verdun (843) the territory east of the Rhine became the East <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Kingdom, from which the present <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> has developed. A strong central authority was lacking during the reigns of the weak East <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kings of the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> dynasty. Each German tribe was forced to rely upon itself for defence against the incursions of the Normans from the north and of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> from the east, consequently the tribes once more chose dukes as rulers. The first Saxon duke was Otto the Illustrious (880-912) of the Liudolfinger line (descendants of Liudolf); Otto was able to extend his power over Thuringia. Otto's son Henry was elected King of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (919-936); Henry is justly called the real founder of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. His son <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a> (936-973) was the first German king to receive from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the imperial Roman crown (962). <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a> was followed as king and emperor by his son <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a> (973-983), who was succeeded by his son <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> (983-1002); both the kings last mentioned vainly endeavoured to establish German authority in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The line of Saxon emperors expired with Henry II (1002-1024), who was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1146. Henry I had been both King of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and Duke of Saxony at the same time. Mainly for the sake of his ducal possessions he had carried on a long and difficult struggle with the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> on the eastern boundary of his country. The <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Emperor Otto I</a> was also for the greater part of his reign Duke of Saxony. <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a> brought the Slavonic territory on the right bank of the Elbe and Saale under German supremacy and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> civilization. He divided the region he had acquired into several margravates, the most important being: the North Mark, out of which in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the present <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Kingdom of Prussia</a> developed, and the Mark of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a>, from which has sprung the present Kingdom of Saxony. Each mark was divided into districts, not only for military and political purposes but also for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>: the central point of each district was a fortified castle. The first churches built near these castles were plain buildings of wood or rubble-stone.



<p>Otto I laid the basis of the organization of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in this territory, that had been won for the German race and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, by making the chief fortified places which he established in the different marks the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The Ottoman emperors also aided much in bringing to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> the great Slavonic people, the Poles, who lived on the right bank of the Oder, as for a time the Polish country was under German suzerainty. Unfortunately the promising beginnings of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> civilization among the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> were largely destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the Slavonic rebellions in the years 980 and 1060. In 960 <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a> had transferred the ducal authority over Saxony to a Count Hermann, who had distinguished himself in the struggle with the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, and the ducal title became hereditary in Count Hermann's <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. This old Duchy of Saxony, as it is called in distinction from the Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg, became the centre of the opposition of the German princes to the imperial power during the era of the Franconian or Salian emperors. With the death of Duke Magnus in 1106 the Saxon ducal <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, frequently called the Billung line, became extinct. The <a href="../cathen/07232a.htm">Emperor Henry V</a> (1106-25) gave the Duchy of Saxony in fief to Count Lothair of Supplinburg, who in 1125 became King of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and at his death (1137) transferred the Duchy of Saxony to his son-in-law, Duke Henry the Proud, of the princely <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a>. The hundred years of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> waged by the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a> with the Hohenstaufen emperors is famous in history. The son of Henry the Proud (d. 1139) was Henry the Lion (d. 1195), who extended German authority and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> into the present Mecklenburg and <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>, and re-established <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in the territories devastated by the Slavonic revolts. Henry the Lion refused to aid the <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa</a> in his campaign against the cities of <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> in 1176, consequently in 1180 the bann of the empire was proclaimed against Henry at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, and 1181 the old Duchy of Saxony was cut up at the Diet of Gelnhausen into many small portions. The greater share of its western portion was given, as the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>. The Saxon <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had before this possessed sovereign authority in their territories, though under the suzerainty of the Duke of Saxony, were now subject only to the imperial government; the case was the same with a large number of secular countships and cities.

<p>The Diet of Gelnhausen is of much importance in the history of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The Emperor Frederick executed here a great legal act. Yet the splitting up of the extensive country of the Saxons into a large number of principalities subject only to the imperial government was one of the causes of the system of petty states which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> so disadvantageous to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in its later history. The territory of the old duchy never again bore the name of Saxony; the large western part acquired the name of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>. However, as regards customs and peculiarities of speech, the designation Lower Saxony is still in existence for the districts on the lower Elbe, that is, the northern part of the present Province of Saxony, <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, etc., in distinction from Upper Saxony, that is, the present Kingdom of Saxony, and Thuringia. From the era of the conversion of the Saxons up to the revolt of the sixteenth century, a rich <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> was developed in the territory included in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Duchy of Saxony. Art, learning, poetry, and the writing of history reached a high degree of perfection in the many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Among the most noted places of learning were the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Corbie, <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, and M&uuml;nster. This era produced architecturally fine churches of the Romanesque style that are still in existence, as the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of Goslar, Soest, and Brunswick, the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Bartholomew at <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, the collegiate churches at Quedlinburg, K&ouml;nigslutter, Gernrode, etc. Hildesheim, which contains much Romanesque work, has especially fine churches of this style. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> at Naumberg, <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, and Osnabr&uuml;ck are striking examples of the Transition period. Only a few of these buildings still belong to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
<h2 id="section2">Electoral Saxony</h2>

<p>After the dissolution of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Duchy of Saxony the name Saxony was first applied to a small part of the ancient duchy situated on the Elbe around the city of <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>. This was given to Bernard of Ascania, the second son of Albert the Bear, who was the founder of the Mark of Brandenburg, from which has come the present <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Kingdom of Prussia</a>. Bernard's son, Albert I, added to this territory the lordship of Lauenburg, and Albert's sons divided the possessions into Saxe-Wittenberg and Saxe-Lauenburg. When in 1356 the Emperor Charles IV issued the Golden <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, the fundamental law of the empire which settled the method of electing the German emperor, the Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg was made one of the seven electorates. The duke as elector thereby received the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to elect, in company with the other six electors, the German emperor. In this way the country, though small in area, obtained an influential position. The electoral dignity had connected with it the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of primogeniture, that is, only the eldest son could succeed as ruler; this excluded the division of the territory among several heirs and consequently the disintegration of the country. The importance of this stipulation is shown by the history of most of the German principalities which were not electorates. The Ascanian line of Saxe-Wittenberg became extinct in 1422. The Emperor Sigismund bestowed the country and electoral dignity upon Margrave Frederick the Valiant of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a>, a member of the Wettin line. As was mentioned above, the Margravate of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a> had been founded by the <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Emperor Otto I</a>. In 1089 it came into the possession of the Wettin <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, who from 1247 also owned the eastern part of the Margravate of Thuringia. In 1422 Saxe-Wittenberg, and the Margravates of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a> and Thuringia were united into one country, which gradually received the name of Saxony. Elector Frederick the Valiant died in 1464, and his two sons made a division of his territories at Leipzig on 26 August, 1485, which led to the still existing separation of the Wettin dynasty into the Ernestine and Albertine lines. Duke Ernest, the founder of the Ernestine line, received by the Partition of Leipzig the Duchy of Saxony and the electoral dignity united with it, besides the Landgravate of Thuringia; Albert, the founder of the Albertine line, received the Margravate of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a>. Thus the Ernestine line seemed to have the greater authority. However, in the sixteenth century the electoral dignity fell to the Albertine line, and at the beginning of the nineteenth century it received the royal title as well.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant revolt</a> of the sixteenth century was effected under the protection of the electors of Saxe-Wittenberg. The Elector Frederick the Wise established a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> in 1502, at which the Augustinian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Martin Luther</a> was made professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in 1508; at the same time he became one of the preachers at the castle church of <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>. On 31 October, 1517, he posted up on this church the ninety-five theses against <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> with which he began what is called the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The elector did not become at once an adherent of the new opinions, but granted his protection to Luther; consequently, owing to the intervention of the elector, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> did not summon Luther to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1518); also through the elector's mediation Luther received the imperial safe-conduct to the Diet of Worms (1521). When Luther was declared at Worms to be under the ban of the entire empire the elector had him brought to the Castle of the Wartburg in <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> spread first in Saxe-Wittenberg. The successor Frederick the Wise (d. 1525) was his brother John the Constant (d. 1532). John was already a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> Lutheran; he exercised full authority over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, introduced the Lutheran Confession, ordered the deposition of all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who continued in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, and directed the use of a new liturgy drawn up by Luther. In 1531 he formed with a number of other ruling princes the Smalkaldic League, for the maintenance of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and for common defence against the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">German Emperor Charles V</a>, because <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles</a> was an opponent of the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. The son and successor of John the Constant was John Frederick the Magnanimous (d. 1554). He was also one of the heads of the Smalkaldic League, which was inimical to the emperor and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. In 1542 he seized the Diocese of Naumburg-Zeitz, and attacked and plundered the secular possessions of the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a> and <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> was forcibly suppressed in all directions and the churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were robbed. John Frederick was defeated and captured by <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> at the Battle of M&uuml;hlberg on the Elbe, 24 April, 1547. In the Capitulation of <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>, 19 May, 1547, the elector was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to yield Saxe-Wittenberg and the electoral dignity to Duke Maurice of Saxe-Meissen. After this the only possession of the Ernestine line of the Wettin <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was Thuringia, which, however, on account of repeated divisions among the heirs was soon cut up into a number of duchies. Those still in existence are: the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, the Duchies of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, <a href="../cathen/13495a.htm">Saxe-Meiningen</a>, and Saxe-Altenburg.

<p>Duke Albert (d. 1500) was succeeded in the Duchy of Saxe-Meissen by his son <a href="../cathen/06457a.htm">George the Bearded</a> (d. 1539). George was a strong opponent of the Lutheran <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and had repeatedly sought to influence his cousins the Electors of Saxe-Wittenberg in favour of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but George's brother and successor, Henry the Pious (d. 1541), was won over to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> by the influence of his wife Catharine of Mecklenburg, and thus Saxe-Meissen was also lost to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Henry's son and successor Maurice was one of the most conspicuous <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> period. Although a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> and desire to increase his possessions led him to join the emperor against the members of the Smalkaldic League. The Capitulation of <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> gave him, as already mentioned, the electoral dignity and Saxe-Wittenberg, so that the Electorate of Saxony now consisted of Saxe-Wittenberg and Saxe-Meissen together, under the authority of the Albertine line of the Wettin <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Partly from resentment at not receiving also what was left of the Ernestine possessions, but moved still more by his desire to have a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> head to the empire, Maurice fell away from the German Emperor. He made a treaty with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (1551) in which he gave the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, Toul, and Verdun in Lorraine to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and secretly shared in all the princely conspiracies against the emperor who only escaped capture by flight; and during the same year the emperor was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> by the Treaty of Passau to grant freedom of religion to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Estates. Maurice died in 1553 at the age of thirty-two. His brother and successor Elector Augustus took the Dioceses of Merseburg, Naumburg, and Meissen for himself. The last <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Merseburg, Michael Helding, called Sidonius, died at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1561. The emperor demanded the election of a new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but the Elector Augustus forced the election of his son Alexander, who was eight years old, as administrator; when Alexander died in 1565 he administered the diocese himself. In the same manner after the death of <a href="../cathen/11787a.htm">Bishop Pflug</a> (d. 1564), the last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Naumburg, the elector confiscated the Diocese of Naumburg and forbade the exercise of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion. Those <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> canons who were still <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> were only permitted to exercise their religion for ten years more.

<p>In 1581 John of Haugwitz, the last <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a>, resigned his office, and in 1587 became a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. The episcopal domains fell likewise to Saxony, and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter ceased to exist. During the reigns of the Elector Augustus (d. 1586), and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> (d. 1591), a freer form of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, called Crypto-Calvinism prevailed in the duchy. During the reign of Christian II (d. 1611) the chancellor, Crell, who had spread the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, was overthrown and beheaded (1601) and a rigid Lutheranism was reintroduced and with it a religious <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. The great religious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> called the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a> (1618-48) occurred during the reign of Elector John George (1611-56). In this struggle the elector was at first neutral, and for a long time he would not listen to the overtures of Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden. It was until the imperial general <a href="../cathen/14724c.htm">Tilly</a> advanced into Saxony that the elector joined Sweden. However, after the Battle of N&ouml;rdlingen (1634) the elector concluded the Peace of Prague (1635) with the emperor. By this treaty Saxony received the Margravates of Upper and Lower Lusatia as a <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> fief, and the condition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> lands that had been secularized was not altered. The Swedes, however, revenged themselves by ten years of plundering. The Treaty of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> of 1648 took from Saxony forever the possibility of extending its territory along the lower course of the Elbe, and confirmed the preponderance of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. In 1653 the direction of the <em>Corpus Evangelicorum</em> fell to Saxony, because the elector became the head of the union of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Imperial Estates. Under the following electors religious questions were not so prominent; a rigid Lutheranism remained the prevailing <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the practice of any other was strictly prohibited. About the middle of the seventeenth century Italian merchants, the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to reappear in the country, settled at <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a>, the capital and at <a href="../cathen/09138b.htm">Leipzig</a>, the most important commercial city; the exercise of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, however, was not permitted to them.

<p>A change followed when on 1 June, 1697, the Elector Frederick Augustus I (1694-1733) returned to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and in consequence of this was soon afterwards elected King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. The formation of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and the private practice of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> was permitted at least in <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a>. As the return of the elector to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> aroused the fear among Lutherans that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion would now be re-established in Saxony, the elector transferred to a government board, the Privy Council, the authority over the Lutheran churches and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> which, until then, had been exercised by the sovereign; the Privy Council was formed exclusively of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. Even after his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> the elector remained the head of the <em>Corpus Evangelicorum</em>, as did his <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> successors until 1806, when the Corpus was dissolved at the same time as the Holy Roman Empire. His son, Elector Frederick Augustus II (1733-63), was received into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on 28 November, 1712, at Bologna, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, while heir-apparent. With this conversion, which on account of the excited state of feeling of the Lutheran population had to be kept secret for five years, the ruling <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Saxony once more became <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Before this, individual members of the Albertine line had returned to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but they had died without issue, as did the last ruler of Saxe-Weissenfels (d. 1746). Another collateral line founded in 1657 was that of Saxe-Naumburg-Zeitz, which became extinct in 1759. Those who became <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of this line were Christian Augustus, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> (d. 1725), and Maurice Adolphus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09141a.htm">Leitmeritz</a> in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> (d. 1759). The most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> promoter of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> in Saxony was the Austrian Archduchess Maria Josepha, daughter of the Emperor Joseph I, who in 1719 married Frederick Augustus, later the second elector of that name. The Court church of <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a> was built 1739-51 by the Italian architect, Chiaveri, in the Roman Baroque style; this is still the finest and most imposing church edifice in Saxony and is one of the most beautiful churches in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Notwithstanding the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of its rulers, however, Saxony remained entirely a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> country; the few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who settled there remained without any political or civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. When in 1806 <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> began a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, Saxony at first allied itself to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, but afterwards joined <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> and entered the Confederation of the Rhine. Elector Frederick Augustus III (1763-1827) received the title of King of Saxony as Frederick Augustus I.
<h2 id="section3">The Kingdom of Saxony</h2>

<p>The new kingdom was an ally of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in all the Napoleonic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the years 1807-13. At the beginning of the great War of Liberation (1813) the king sided neither with <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> nor with his allied opponents, but united his troops with those of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> when <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> threatened to treat Saxony as a hostile country. At the Battle of Leipzig (16-18 October, 1813), when <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> was completely defeated, the greater part of the Saxon troops deserted to the allied forces. The King of Saxony was taken as a <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> to the Castle of Friedrichsfeld near Berlin. The Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1814-15) took from Saxony the greater part of its land and gave it to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, namely 7800 square miles with about 850,000 inhabitants; this ceded territory included the former Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg, the former possessions of the Dioceses of Merseburg and Naumburg, a large part of Lusatia, etc. What <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> had obtained, with the addition of some old <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> districts, was formed into the Province of Saxony.

<p>The Kingdom of Saxony had left only an area of 5789 square miles with a population at that era of 1,500,000 inhabitants; under these conditions it became a member of the German Confederation that was founded in 1815. King John (1854-73) sided with <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> in the struggle between <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> as to the supremacy in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Consequently in the War of 1866, when <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> was successful, the independence of Saxony was once more in danger; only the intervention of the Austrian Emperor saved Saxony from being entirely absorbed by <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. The kingdom, however, was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to join the North German Confederation of which <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> was the head. In 1871 Saxony became one of the states of the newly-founded <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. King John was followed by his son King Albert (1873-1902); Albert was succeeded by his brother George (1902-04); the son of George is King Frederick Augustus III (b. 1865). Prince Maximilian (b. 1870), a brother of the present king, became a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1896, was engaged in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> work in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, and since 1900 has been a professor of canon law and liturgy in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. The Kingdom of Saxony is the fifth state of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> in area and third in population; in 1905 the average population per square mile was 778.8. Saxony is the most densely peopled state of the empire, and indeed of all <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>; the reason is the very large immigration on account of the development of manufactures. In 1910 the population amounted to 5,302,485; of whom 218,033 were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; 4,250,398 Evangelican Lutherans; 14,697 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and a small proportion of other <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of Saxony owes its present numbers largely to immigration during the nineteenth century. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> that can be traced back to the period before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> is found only in one section, the governmental department of Bautzen. Even here there is no continuous <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> district, but there are a number of villages where the population is almost entirely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and two cities (Ostritz and Schirgiswalde) where <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are in the majority. It should also be mentioned that about 1.5 of the inhabitants of Saxony consists of the remains of a Slavonic tribe called by the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> Wends, and in their own language "Serbjo". These Wends, who number about 120,000 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and live in Saxon and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Lusatia, are entirely surrounded by a German population; consequently owing to German influence the Wendic language, manners, and customs are gradually disappearing. About 50,000 Wends live in the Kingdom of Saxony; of these about 12,000 belong to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; some fifty Wendic villages are entirely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. There is also a large Wendic population in the city of Bautzen, where among 30,000 inhabitants 7,000 are Wends.
<h3>The Vicariate Apostolic of Saxony, and the Prefecture Apostolic of Saxon Upper Lusatia</h3>

<p>As regards the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the Kingdom of Saxony is divided into two administrative districts: the Vicariate Apostolic of Saxony, and the Prefecture Apostolic of Saxon Upper Lusatia. The <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> includes the hereditary lands, that is, those portions of Saxony which before 1635 belonged to the Electorate of Saxony and which the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> of 1815 did not take from the country; the vicariate also includes the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg, and the two principalities of <a href="../cathen/12799b.htm">Reuss</a>. The Prefecture Apostolic of Lusatia includes the former Margravate of Lusatia, which in 1635 was separated from <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and given to Saxony; since the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> of 1815, however, this <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> district comprises only that part of Upper Lusatia that has remained Saxon, the present fifth Saxon administrative Department of Bautzen. Since the adjustment of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in 1904 the Vicariate Apostolic of Saxony comprises (including the small principalities of <a href="../cathen/12799b.htm">Reuss</a> and Saxe-Altenburg), 26 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and 7 expositorships, with, in 1909, 55 priests; Upper Lusatia comprises 16 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, of which 7 are Wendic, and 2 expositorships, with altogether 30 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the Wendic <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, the capital of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>; this <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, which was founded in 1740 by two Wends, was originally intended only for Lusatia but now is used for the whole of Saxony. Its pupils first attend the <em>gymnasium</em> of Prague and then the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> there.

<p>The Vicariate Apostolic of Saxony was established in 1763 by <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Pope Clement XIII</a>; before this the confessors of the electors, who like all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in Saxony at that era were <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, conducted the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> under the title of superior. The most celebrated of these was Father Carlo Maurizio Voltor, an Italian, the confessor of the elector and King Frederick Augustus I. Father Voltor was also a noted diplomatist who had much influence at the court of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, for example, he had some share in obtaining the title of King of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> (1701) for the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Elector of Brandenburg. The first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> was Father Augustin Eggs, S.J.; for some unknown reason he left Saxony after the death of the Elector Frederick Christian (1764). He was followed by Father Franz Herz, S.J., who continued to administer his office after the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Jesuits</a> in 1773; after his death (1800) Dr. Johann Alois Schneider (d. 1818) was appointed <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. In 1816 Dr. Schneider was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Argia, being the first Saxon <a href="../cathen/15401a.htm">vicar</a> to be made a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In the troubled times of 1813-14 he was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> friend and trusted adviser of the royal family; he also accompanied the king when the latter was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. His successor, Ignatz Bernhard Mauermann (d. 1845), had the title of <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Pellia. In 1831 the canons of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Bautzen elected Bishop Mauermann as <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/04659a.htm">dean</a> of Bautzen. After Bishop Mauermann's death this union of the two highest <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices in Saxony was dissolved, but since the death of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> dean of Bautzen, Johann Kutschank (1844), the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has held both offices with the exception of the years 1900-04. Bishop Mauermann was succeeded by his older brother Franz Lorenz Mauermann (d. 1845) with the title of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rama. The next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Johann Dittrich (d. 1853), <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Korykus, who in 1844 had been elected <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> dean of Bautzen; he was followed by Ludwig Forwerk (d. 1875), <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09181a.htm">Leontopolis</a>.

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> (1869-70) Bishop Forwerk's skill enabled him to prevent the spread of <a href="../cathen/11235b.htm">Old Catholicism</a> in Saxony at the time when the proclamation of the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">Dogma of Infallibility</a> led to its development in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. He was followed by Franz Bernert (d.1890), <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Azotus, who was succeeded by Dr. Ludwig Wahl (d. 1904), <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cocusus (Cocrun). From 1900 this <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was not able to exercise his office on account of severe illness; during this period the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> appointed the prothonotary, Monsignor Karl Maas, administrator for the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a>, and the canon of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Bautzen, Monsignor Georg Wuschanski, as administrator for Upper Lusatia. In 1904 Wuschanski was made <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Saxony and <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13421c.htm">Samos</a>. Bishop Wuschanski died, however, by the end of 1905. In 1906 his placed was filled by Dr. Alois Sch&auml;fer. Dr. Sch&auml;fer was born at Dingelst&auml;dt in the Eichfelde (Prussian Province of Saxony) on 2 May, 1853, and in 1863 his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> settled at Chemnitz in the Kingdom of Saxony. In 1878 Dr. Sch&auml;fer was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and was at first active in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> work; in 1881 he was made professor of <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> at the lyceum at <a href="../cathen/04795a.htm">Dillingen</a> in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>; in 1885 he became professor of <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> at the <a href="../cathen/10639a.htm">University of M&uuml;nster</a> in <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>; in 1894 he was a professor of the same at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, and in 1903 at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>. His title is: Titular <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01043b.htm">Abila</a>, Vicar Apostolic in the Kingdom of Saxony, Administrator Ecclesiasticus in Saxon Upper Lusatia. The <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> is appointed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of the King of Saxony. According to the Constitution of Saxony the dean of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Bautzen is a permanent member of the Upper House of the Saxon diet, but not the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> as such; he is a member only because the two offices are generally united. The two <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices are combined on account of the revenues, and the union is effected thus: the chapter of Bautzen elects as dean the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> who has already been appointed for the hereditary possessions of Saxony. It should be said, however, that the union is only a personal one and that the two administrative districts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> exist the same after as before the union.

<p>At the time of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> Lusatia belonged politically, as has already been said, to <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, i.e., to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Before his resignation the last <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a> transferred in 1581, with the approval of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration of Lusatia to Johann Leisentritt of Juliusberg, dean of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of Bautzen, as <em>administrator episcopatus</em>. When the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> entered the country Dean Leisentritt was able to keep at least a part of the population faithful to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Most important of those bodies that remained <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> were: the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of St. Peter's at Bautzen; the two celebrated <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, Marienthal near Ostritz on the Neisse and Marienstern between the cities of Kamenz and Bautzen; a part of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> that had been under the control of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and some other independent towns. The only members of the chapter of St. Peter's at Bautzen that remained <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> were the dean, the senior, the <em>cantor</em>, and the <em>scholasticus</em>; the <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>, who according to the rules of the foundation was elected from the chapter at <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a>, became a Lutheran. Ever since that time the provostship has been granted by the Saxon government to a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, generally to one of the higher state officials. This secular <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> has, however, no connexion whatever with the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter; he receives from the government ministry the revenues yielded by the lands belonging to the provostship. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter consists of four resident canons and eight honorary ones; when the position of dean is vacant the power of administration belongs to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> canons; the dean is elected by the regular and honorary canons in the presence of a royal commissioner and is confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. The Cathedral of St. Peter's at Bautzen is the oldest church in Lusatia, and was built 1215-21; at the end of the fifteenth century it was much altered. Since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> the choir has belonged to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which is divided from the choir by a grating, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. Another church in Bautzen retained by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Our Lady, built in the thirteenth century, in which the services of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Wends are held. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter has the right of patronage for six <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, the right of appointment for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for teachers at Bautzen, the same for the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and also the right of patronage for five <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Marienstern, in the Wendic district of Lusatia, that was founded in the middle of the thirteenth century, and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Marienthal in the German section, that was founded before 1234, have done much to preserve <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life in Lusatia. For hundreds of years the pastoral care of the two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> has been exercised by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Osseg in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. A <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> church much visited, especially by the Wends, is at Rosenthal in the Wendic <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Ralbitz. In the treaty between Saxony and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> of 13 May, 1635, by which Lusatia was transferred to Saxony, the Saxon elector was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to grant his special sovereign protection to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communities of Lusatia and the two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, the emperor, as suzerain, retaining the supreme right of protection. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Lusatia had the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to the free exercise of religion, but in agreement with the earlier legal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the State Church, only so far as they belonged to one of the old <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who lived within the boundaries of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to call upon the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the community for all <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a>, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, and burials, or at least must pay for these the customary fees. This compulsion exercised upon the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> living in <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> was not annulled for Lusatia until 1863.

<p>By a treaty of peace between Saxony and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> that was signed at Posen 11 December, 1806, Saxony was made a kingdom and entered the Confederation of the Rhine. This treaty granted the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Saxony nominally, although not in reality, civil and political equality with the Lutherans. The fifth article of the treaty declared that the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic Church</a> services were placed on an absolute parity with the services of the Augsburg and allied confessions, and subjects belonging to both <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> were to enjoy civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. Now for the first time the bells of the Court Church at <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a>, which had hung silent in the tower for fifty years, could be rung. The concessions to Saxon <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> made in the convention of 1806 were confirmed by the royal edict of 16 February, 1807, and by the Constitution of the German confederation of 1815 (art. XVI). The relations between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> were still further defined by the Edict of 19 February, 1827, which is still in force. This edict abrogated for the hereditary territories the compulsory dependence of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> on <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and created the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Consistory for the administration and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> including matters pertaining to marriage. This consistory is made up of three <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and two secular councillors. The <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> has the right of <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> for the appointments. A vicarial court was created as, with the exception of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the highest court of appeal; it consists of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, two <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> councillors, one secular <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> councillor, a legal assistant, and in addition for matters pertaining to marriage two <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> councillors. At the same time the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> was declared to be simply a special department for Church and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> matters under the supervision of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> state ministry. In Upper Lusatia the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> was placed in the hands of the "consistory of the chapter at Bautzen", which consists of the dean, three <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> councillors and a secular justiciary. The vicarial court was made the court of appeal.

<p>The Constitution of 4 September, 1831, confirmed the ordinances and arrangements that were then valid. It was forbidden to establish new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in addition to the two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of Marienthal and Marienstern already in existence in Lusatia, or to admit into Saxony the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> or other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. It was not until a few years ago that a few Grey Sisters and <a href="../cathen/10201a.htm">nuns of St. Charles Borromeo</a> were allowed to settle in Saxony, in all in thirteen places within eight cities. The authority of the State over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the supreme supervision and the right of protection were assigned by the Constitution to the king as <em>jus circa sacra</em>. By the Law of 7 November, 1837, this authority was given to the department of the minister of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and worship, who by the Constitution must always be a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. The administration and use made of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is also under the supervision of the State. Money for the needs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> beyond what is provided by the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> or endowments is obtained from a Church tax laid by the State (law of 2 August, 1878). The tax is raised as a supplementary income tax; the yearly amount of the tax is fixed by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> minister of worship and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> can fix the amount of their Church tax themselves. In the years succeeding 1870 there was a bitter struggle in most of the German states between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> called the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em>; during this period a law was issued in Saxony concerning the exercise of State supervision. This law contains the greater part of the ordinances which had been up to then in effect, and in its measures for putting the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> into action follows the Austrian and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the decade of 1870-1880, that were inimical to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Public church service can only be held in the 57 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, dependent <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; mission services and religious instruction can further be held at certain periods of time in about sixty places. In addition there are 8 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> that are private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. Very few church processions are permitted. The approval of the State is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the general decrees of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> authorities when these in any way encroach upon State or municipal affairs; the State authorities are to decide whether infringement has taken place. The approval of the ministry is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the founding of new churches and institutions for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, for settling or changing the boundaries of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, for establishing church service at new stations, in general for new acts of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration of any kind, which in any way whatever come into contact with national affairs or the ordinary ones of civil life.

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office, whether in public or private service, permanent or subject to recall, can only be given to a German who has finished the course at a <em>gymnasium</em>, studied three years at a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and has passed a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> examination for his office. Whoever has been trained at a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> conducted by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> or a similar order is excluded. Further, the national Government can reject anyone who has been chosen for an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office, if it believes that he will use his influence against the State <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> or ordinances. The State Government is to be notified at once of every vacancy and of every appointment of a spiritual office. As a rule change of religion is not permitted before the twenty-first year; before change of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the convert must notify the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of his intention and may have a four weeks' period of reflection assigned to him; after the expiration of this term the convert can demand a certificate of dismissal. The religion of the father is determinative for children of <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, unless the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> have made a legal agreement otherwise before the child is six years old. All the State <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are denominational; they are not established and maintained by the political communes but by special <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> communes. In localities where the population is of different faiths the religious minority, if able to do so, can form a new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> commune; special religious instruction for the benefit of the religious minority is not given at the expense of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> commune of the majority where that alone exists. Up to the twelfth year <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> religious instruction is legally permissible for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children. At present a new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> law is being prepared, as the School law of 1873 contains many ordinances that are now out of date; however, the confessional character of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and the religious supervision of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the respective place is to be retained; but efforts have been and are still made to set aside at least the religious supervision of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. As regards <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> there is a preparatory <em>gymnasium</em> in <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a>, a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Bautzen, for training <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers for the primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, that is supported by the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of Bautzen, and 51 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> public primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. There are about 300 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> male teachers and about 20 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> teachers. Special <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religious instruction is given at more than one hundred and thirty places where there are only <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Only about 15,000 of the 24,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> children attend <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; of the remaining 9000 children about 3500 have no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religious instruction. The pressing necessity of new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> cannot be met on account of the lack of money, as most of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who have come into the country are poor factory hands. On account both of this lack of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and of the equally great lack of churches, far more than 10,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> became <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> during the years 1900 and 1910.
<h2 id="section4">The Prussian province of Saxony</h2>

<p>The province has an area of 9,746 square miles, and in 1905 had 2,979,221 inhabitants. Of its population 230,860 (7.8 per cent) are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, 2,730,098 (91 per cent) are <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>; 9981 hold other forms of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a>, and 8050 are <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. During the summer months about 15,000 to 20,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> labourers, called <em>Sachseng&auml;nger</em>, come into the country; they are <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Province of Posen, from Russian <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, or Galicia. The province is divided into the three government departments of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, Merseburg, and Erfurt. The <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Province of Saxony was formed in 1815 from the territories, about 8,100 square miles in extent, ceded by the Kingdom of Saxony, with the addition of some districts already belonging to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, the most important of which are the Altmark, from which the State of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> sprang; the former immediate principalities of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Halberstadt, which <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> had received by the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> (1648) at the close of the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a>; and the Eichsfeld, with the city of Erfurt and its surroundings. Up to 1802 the Eichsfeld and Erfurt had belonged to the principality of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>; a large of the population had, therefore, retained the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> during the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. As regards <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs the Province of Saxony had been assigned to the <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Diocese of Paderborn</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> "De salute animarum" of 16 July, 1821. The province contains three <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administrative divisions: the episcopal commissariat of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> that embraces the entire governmental department of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> and consists of four deaneries and 25 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; the "ecclesiastical Court" of Erfurt, which includes the governmental Department of Merseburg and the eastern half of the governmental Department of Erfurt; and consists of 2 deaneries (Halle and Erfurt) and 28 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; the episcopal commissariat of Heiligenstadt, which embraces the western half of the governmental department of Erfurt, that is called the Upper Eichsfeld, and consists of 16 deaneries and 129 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>.

<p>In those parts of the governmental Department of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> which belonged originally to the former <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Archdiocese of Magdeburg</a> and the Diocese of Halberstadt all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life was not entirely destroyed during the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Besides fourteen <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> that continued in existence, there were in Halberstadt a number of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> in connexion with the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and the collegiate Church of Sts. Peter and Paul. As the entire native population had become <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> these <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were only maintained by the immigration of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who, from the time of the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, though in small numbers, steadily came into the country; thus there arose around the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> small <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communities. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were all suppressed during the great secularization of the beginning of the nineteenth century, and thirteen <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were formed, for which the State provided a fund from a part of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. The other <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the governmental Department of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> were created after the middle of the nineteenth century, when, in consequence of the development of the manufacture of sugar, increasing numbers of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> came into the country; the St. Boniface Association gave the money to found these <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>.

<p>In 1905 the governmental Department of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> contained 76,288 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, that is, 6.25 per cent of the population. The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> of the sixteenth century had its origin in the present governmental Department of Merseburg, which includes parts of the old <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, Halberstadt, Merseburg, Naumburg-Zeitz, and Brandenburg; in this region all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life was destroyed. It was not until after the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> that small <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communities arose, from the entrance into the district of miners, merchants, pedlars, etc.; these communities grew especially in the nineteenth century on account of the development of manufactures. The first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church service to be held again in this district was established in 1710 at Halle on the Saale by <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> of the Monastery of St. Andreas at Halberstadt; the first <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> was also erected at Halle in 1810; the other <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were founded by the St. Boniface Association. In 1905 the governmental Department of Merseburg contained 47,382 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, that is, 4 per cent of the population. The governmental department of Erfurt is an almost entirely <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> district in which, during the nineteenth century, scattered <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> settled near districts which had preserved their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> amid the storms of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> era; these districts are the Eichsfeld and a part of the population of Erfurt and its vicinity. Erfurt was founded in 742 by <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> as the See of Thuringia. The first and only <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, St. Adelar, suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in 755 with <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, and the territory of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was united with the <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Archdiocese of Mainz</a>. From the beginning, however, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> had episcopal assistants at Erfurt, who, from early in the fourteenth century, were in reality coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and gradually retained almost the same position as a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. After the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Archdiocese of Mainz</a> (1802), the Diocese of Erfurt was assigned to the <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Diocese of Ratisbon</a>, then in 1807 to Corbie, and in 1821 to <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>. Up to the present day there is still in existence at Erfurt an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> board with certain episcopal powers which is called the "Ecclesiastical Court". Celebrated <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> of Erfurt are: the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> that was begun about the middle of the twelfth century upon the spot where had stood a church built by <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>; and the Church of St. Severus, erected in the fourteenth century. In 1905 the governmental Department of Erfurt contained 107,190 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> that is, 21.53 per cent of the population; the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> steadily declines, in 1817 it amounted to 29 per cent. Outside of Erfurt and its immediate vicinity, where the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> form 12 per cent of the population, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the main live together in communities in the Upper Eichsfeld in the three counties of Heiligenstadt (91 per cent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>), Worbis (77 per cent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>), and M&uuml;lhausen-Land (43 per cent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>). The soil of the Upper Eichsfeld is not productive; it does not offer, therefore, any of the conditions for industrial development, and many of its inhabitants are forced to <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrate</a>. In the Department of Erfurt the collegiate foundation of Nordhausen has also remained <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> from the early times; in 1811 it was made into a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. As regards <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, and the other questions concerning the relations between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Kingdom of Prussia</a> are in force.
