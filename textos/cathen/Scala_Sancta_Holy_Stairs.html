<h1>Scala Sancta (Holy Stairs)</h1>  

<p>Consisting of twenty-eight white marble steps, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, near the Lateran; according to tradition the staircase leading once to the <a href="../cathen/12404a.htm">pr&aelig;torium of Pilate</a> at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, hence sanctified by the footsteps of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> during his Passion.

<p>The historians of the monument relate that the Holy Stairs were brought from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> about 326 by St. Helena, mother of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> they were known as <em>Scala Pilati</em>, the Stairs of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>. From old plans it can be gathered that they led to a corridor of the Lateran Palace, near the Chapel of St. Sylvester, were covered with a special roof, and had at their sides other stairs for common use. When <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> in 1589 destroyed the old <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> palace and built the new one, he ordered the Holy Stairs be transferred to their present site, before the <em>Sancta Sanctorum</em> (Holy of Holies). The latter is the old private <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, dedicated to <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>, and the only remaining part of the former Lateran Palace, receiving its name from the many precious <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> preserved there. The Sancta Sanctorum also contains the celebrated image of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "not made by human hands", which on certain occasions used to be carried through <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in procession. These holy treasures, which since <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> (1513-21) have not been seen by anybody, have recently been the object of learned dissertations by Grisar and Lauer.

<p>In its new site the Scala Sancta is flanked by four other stairs, two on each side, for common use, since the Holy Stairs may only be ascended on the knees, a devotion much in favour with <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> and the Roman faithful, especially on Fridays and in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>. Not a few <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> are recorded to have performed this <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> exercise; <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, who in 1853 entrusted the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionist</a> Fathers with the care of the sanctuary, ascended the Holy Stairs on 19 Sept., 1870, the eve of the entrance of the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> into <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> on 2 Sept., 1817 granted those who ascend the stairs in the prescribed manner an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of nine years for every step. Finally <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, on 26 Feb., 1908, granted a plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> to be gained as often as the stairs are devoutly ascended after confession and communion. Imitations of the Scala Sancta have been erected in various places, as in Lourdes and in some <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> are attached to them by special concessions.
