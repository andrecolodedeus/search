<h1>Scapular</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Name, meaning, and origin</h2>

<p>The scapular (from Latin, <em>scapula</em>, shoulder) forms a part, and now the most important part, of the habit of the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> orders. Other orders and numerous <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> congregations (both male and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a>) have also adopted the scapular from the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> orders. It is usually worn over the habit or soutane.
<h3>Description</h3>

<p>It consists essentially of a piece of cloth about the width of the breast from one shoulder to the other (i.e. about fourteen to eighteen inches), and of such a length that it reaches not quite to the feet in front and behind. There are also shorter forms of the scapular. In the middle is the opening for the head, the scapular thus hanging down from two narrow connecting segments resting on the shoulders. Originally the longitudinal segments of cloth were connected by cross segments passing under the arms &#151; a form which exists even today. In former times also two segments of cloth hung over the shoulders, which they covered, and thus formed a cross with the longitudinal segments over the breast and back (cf. P.L., CIII, 1231, editorial note).
<h3>Origin</h3>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> scapular, like the whole <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> habit and indeed the <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">liturgical vestments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, developed from the ordinary clothing of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. And, just as the <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a> is the special sign of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dignity and power, the scapular is now the sign of the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monk</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/10472a.htm">West</a>, in the case of <a href="../cathen/02467b.htm">St. Benedict</a>, the scapular was at first nothing else than a working garment or apron such as was then worn by agricultural labourers. Thus, in the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>, it was expressly termed "scapulare propter opera" (c. xxv in P.L. LXXVI, 771). From this developed the special <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> garment, to which a <a href="../cathen/07464a.htm">hood</a> could be fastened at the back. In fact, the original scapular of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> was so made that it acted also as a covering for the head, and thus as a <a href="../cathen/07464a.htm">hood</a>. The scapular of the <a href="../cathen/10472a.htm">West</a> corresponded to the <em>analabus</em> of the <a href="../cathen/10467a.htm">East</a>.
<h3>Ceremony and symbolism</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">Monastic</a> formulae of <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">profession</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10472a.htm">West</a> from the ninth century make no mention of the investment with the scapular. It was only gradually that it became one of the important part of the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> habit. Later, like the <em>analabus</em>, it was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> presented during the clothing and the symbolism of the scapular is emphasized in the formula used during this <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. Especially the <em>analabus</em> but also the scapular was often called simply <em>crux</em> (cross) on account of its shape, and symbolism introduced accordingly. It was thus natural to term the scapular <em>jugum Christi</em> (the yoke of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>); it was also called <em>scutum</em> (shield), as it was laid over the head, which it originally covered and protected with one portion (from which the <a href="../cathen/07464a.htm">hood</a> afterwards developed).
<h3>Small nighttime scapulars</h3>

<p>In the rules of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> it is expressly prescribed under penalties that even at night the scapular must be worn, e.g. in the case of the <a href="../cathen/13736a.htm">Servites</a> and <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>. For night the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> have now a special smaller scapular which, however, is still much larger than the so-called great scapular of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis; it measures about twenty inches in length and ten in width. In the Constitutions of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite Order</a> of 1369 (Cod. Vatic. lat. 3991 fol. 33 v.) it is appointed that each candidate of the order must bring with him his bed and in addition: "habeat etiam cum rauba sua parvum scapulare cum tunica ad jacendum" (cf. Wessels, "Analecta Ord. Carmel.", Rome, 1911, p. 122). Perhaps the smaller scapular for the night is here hinted at or foreshadowed. Perhaps even the small scapular of the <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> (that for the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>) may be suggested, since the reference is to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> coming from the world (<a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>) who should have this small scapular. It is likewise prescribed in the Constitutions of the <a href="../cathen/13736a.htm">Servites</a> of 1257 "quod nullus accedat sine scapulari et tunica dormitum". Again, after <a href="../cathen/02467b.htm">St. Benedict</a> had declared in his <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule</a> XXII: "Vestiti dormiant et cincti cingulis aut funibus", it was prescribed in the "Consuetudines sublacenses": "Vestiti autem dormiant id est ad minus in una tunica et scapulari et cincti ut sint parati surgere" (Albers, "Consuet. monasticae", II, 126). This scapular thus appears to have been a portion of the night clothing of <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monks</a>.
<h2 id="section2">The scapular of the third orders</h2>

<p>To the first orders have been gradually added the second and <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">third orders</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11188a.htm">oblates</a>, who receive the proper habit from the first orders.
<h3>Third order use of the full habit</h3>

<p>Early in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> numerous <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay persons</a> had already joined the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a> as <a href="../cathen/11188a.htm">oblates</a>, these often received from the first order the entire <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> habit which they wore either constantly in the world or at least during Divine Service. It was regarded as a great grace and privilege to be able to die and be <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> habit, which was frequently given to the dying or placed on the deceased before <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">burial</a>.

<p>In the revised <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the Oblates of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>, confirmed in 1891 and 1904, it is stated in conclusion: "The <a href="../cathen/11188a.htm">Oblates</a> may be <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the black habit of the order, with scapular and girdle, wherever the conditions allow the fulfilment of this <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> wish". In the first Rule of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis of 1221 (also in that of 1289), the investment is fairly exactly described, but there is no mention of a scapular. The first Rule of the Third <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a> in the first half of the thirteenth century prescribed likewise a formal and complete investment. Here also there is no mention of the scapular. As in the case of the other <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">third orders</a> this made its appearance later, until finally it became usual to wear the scapular under one's ordinary clothing instead of the full habit of the order. By the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Sacred Congregation of Bishops and Regulars of 20 December, 1616, it was declared that the <em>Bizzoche</em> who lived in the houses of relatives (and thus quite without restraint in the world), might wear the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">tertiary</a> habit, but without <em>supriectum, sottogola</em>, and <em>patientia</em> (i.e., without <a href="../cathen/15321c.htm">veil</a>, pectorale, and scapular). Later, the wearing of the special habit of an order became unusual, and the constant wearing of such was regarded as a <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a>.


<h3>Third order use of the large scapular</h3>

<p>Gradually, however the most distinctive article of the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> habit, the scapular, was given, and is in an ever smaller form. It has thus come to pass that the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">third orders</a> for the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, such as those of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/13736a.htm">Servites</a> and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, wear today as their special badge and habit a "large" scapular, consisting essentially of two segments of woollen cloth (about four and a half inches long and two and three-eighths inches broad in the case of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> scapular, much longer and broader in the case of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> although no particular length or breadth is prescribed) connected with each other by two strings or bands. The best known scapular is that of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis, or, as it is simply called, the Scapular of St. Francis; it is brown, grey, or black in colour and has (at least generally) on one of the woollen segments the image of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a> and on the other that of the little church of <a href="../cathen/12286a.htm">Portiuncula</a>. For these large scapulars the same general rules hold good as described in detail below in the case of the small scapulars. It is especially <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who desire to share in the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> and <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privileges</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">third orders</a> shall wear the scapulars constantly. However, the Congregation of Indulgences expressly declared on 30 April, 1885, that the wearing of the scapulars of smaller form and of the same size as those of the <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternities</a> entitled one to gain the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">third order</a> (cf. Constit. Leonis XIII, "Misericors Dei Filius", 30 May, 1883; "Acta S. Sed.", XV, 513 sqq.).
<h2 id="section3">The small scapulars</h2>
<h3>The four oldest small scapulars</h3>

<p>Like the large scapulars the first and oldest small scapulars originated to a certain extent in the real <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> scapular. Pious <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay persons</a> of either sex attached themselves to the <a href="../cathen/13736a.htm">Servites</a> for instance; many of those who were in a position to do so attached themselves to the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">third order</a> with <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, but in the case of many others either this was impossible or the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of doing so had as yet not occurred to them. In this manner developed, shortly after the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/13736a.htm">Servite Order</a>, the Confraternity of the Servi B. Mariae Virginis. Similarly originated the Confraternity of Our Lady of Mount Carmel; that this existed in 1280 is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the still extant "Libro degli ordinamenti de la compagnia di Santa Maria del Carmine scritto nel 1280" (edited by Giulio Piccini at Bologna, 1867, in "Scelta di Curiosit&agrave; letterarie"). The members of these <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternities</a> were called the <em>confratres</em> and <em>consores</em> of the respective orders; they had special rules and participated in the spiritual goods of the order to which then belonged. It is probable also that many of those who could not be promoted to the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">third order</a> or who were special benefactors of the first order received the habit of the order or a large scapular similar to that of the <a href="../cathen/11188a.htm">oblates</a>, which they might wear when dying and in which they might be <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a>. It was only later and gradually that the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> developed of giving to everyone connected with the order the real scapular of the order in miniature as their badge to be always worn day and night over or under their ordinary clothing.

<p>It was now that these <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternities</a> developed into scapular <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternities</a> in the modern sense. On account of the scapulars the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> resorted ever more to these <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternities</a>, especially after they had heard of the wonderful <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">graces</a> which members had received through the scapulars, and above all when the story of the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">apparition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> and of her promise to all who wore the Scapular of Mount Carmel faithfully until death became known. Consequently, the four oldest small scapulars are likewise the badges of four <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternities</a>, attached respectively to the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, <a href="../cathen/13736a.htm">Servites</a>, <a href="../cathen/15045d.htm">Trinitarians</a> and <a href="../cathen/10197b.htm">Mercederiansy</a>. Later on the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> gave the members of their <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">third order</a> for the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> the large scapular, and founded also a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> the members of which were given as their badge not a small scapular, but a girdle. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> likewise assigned to their <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">third order</a> the large scapular as its badge, and to their principal <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">rosary</a>. Since 1903, however, there is a small scapular of <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> provided with an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> but connected with no <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> ("Analecta eccl.", 1904, p. 261). The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, on the other hand founded a special <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> in the latter half of the thirteenth century, and gave to its members a small scapular of <a href="../cathen/02467b.htm">St. Benedict</a>. An attempt was later made to give the <a href="../cathen/11188a.htm">oblates</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> a larger scapular which could be worn constantly. However, the regulation which was already quoted from the new <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Oblates still remain in force.
<h3>The newer small scapulars</h3>

<p>In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> other orders received the faculty of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> small scapulars and investing the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> with them, although such scapulars were not always connected with a <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a>.

<p>Thus originated the Blue Scapular of the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a> in the seventeenth century, in connexion with which a <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> was not founded until the nineteenth century. The <a href="../cathen/12373c.htm">Fathers of the Precious Blood</a> have a scapular and <a href="../cathen/12373b.htm">confraternity</a> named after their order. Similarly the Camillians have the Confraternity and Scapular of Our Lady the Help of the Sick, and the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Augustinians</a> the Confraternity and Scapular of the Mother of Good Counsel, in which cases the scapular and <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> are not inseparably united; finally the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> have the Scapular of St. Joseph without a corresponding <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> have the Red, and the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a> the Black Scapular of the Passion. Under <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> originated in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the Scapular Confraternity of St. Michael the Archangel, which is attached not so much to an order as to the church in which it exists. Also under <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, in 1900, were approved the Scapular of the Sacred Heart, the Scapular of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary (both without a corresponding <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a>), and the Scapular of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, which originated in 1877. These complete the list of the seventeen known small scapulars.

<p>The history of the origin of the first four small scapulars is still to a great extent obscure. It is probable that the revival of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> in the sixteenth century (the <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a>) gave the chief impetus to the development of the scapulars, as to other institutions and practices (e.g., <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternities</a> and <a href="../cathen/11141b.htm">novenas</a>). To assign an exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> to the origin of the first small scapular is still impossible; it appears, however, that the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> scapular antedated all the others, as a prototype well worthy of imitation, and had its origin the above mentioned scapular prescribed for wearing at night. At the end of the sixteenth century the scapular was certainly widespread, as is clear from the information given by the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Joseph Falcone in "La Cronica Carmelitana", a book which was published at <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a> in 1595.

<p>Before entering into further detail concerning the individual scapulars, we must give the general rules and regulations which apply to all the small scapulars.
<h2 id="section4">General ecclesiastical regulations concerning the small scapulars</h2>

<p>The small scapulars consist essentially of two quadrilateral segments of woolen cloth (about two and three-quarter inches long by two inches wide), connected with each other by two strings or bands in such a manner that, when the bands rest on the shoulders, the front segment rests before the breast, while the other hangs down an equal distance at the back. The two segments of cloth need not necessarily be equally large, various scapulars having the segment before the breast of the above dimensions while the segment at the back is much smaller. The material of these two essential parts of the scapular must be of woven wool; the strings or bands may be of any material, and of any one colour. The colour of the segments of woollen cloth depends on the colour of the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> habit, which it to a certain extent represents, or on the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of which it is worn. Here, however, it must be remarked that the so called Brown Scapular of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> may be black, and that the bands of the Red Scapular of the Passion must be of red wool. On either or both of the woollen segments may be sewn or <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidered</a> becoming representations or other decorations (emblems, names etc.) of a different material. It is only in the case of the Red Scapular that the images are expressly prescribed.

<p>Several scapulars may be attached to the same pair of strings or bands; each scapular must of course be complete, and must be attached to both bands. In many cases the five best-known of the early scapulars are attached to the same pair of bands; this combination is then known as the "fivefold scapular". The five are: the Scapular of the Most <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a>, that of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a>, of the Immaculate Conception, and the Red Scapular of the Passion. When the scapulars are thus joined together, the bands must be of red wool, as required by the Red Scapular; it is customary to wear the Red Scapular uppermost and that of the Most <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a> undermost, so that the images specially prescribed in the case of the Red, and the small red and blue <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a> on the Scapular of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a>, may be visible.

<p>Only at the original reception of any scapular is either the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> or the investment with such by an authorized <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. When a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> needs a new scapular, he can put on an unblessed one. If the investment with a scapular be inseparably connected with reception into a <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a>, the reception and enrollment must take place on the same occasion as the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> and investment. To share in the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> and <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privileges</a> of a scapular, one must wear it constantly; it may be worn over or under one's clothing and may be laid aside for a short time, if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Should one have ceased wearing the scapular for a long period (even through indifference), one gains none of the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> during this time, but, by simply resuming the scapular, one again participates in the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privileges</a>, etc. Every scapular, which is not merely an object of <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">private devotion</a> (for there are also such) but is also provided with an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, must be approved by the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>, and the formula of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> must be sanctioned by the Congregation of Rites. In this article we speak only of scapulars approved by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
<h2 id="section5">The scapular medals</h2>

<p>Since 1910 and the regulation of the Holy Office of 16 December of that year (Acta Apost. Sedis, III, 22 sq.) it is permitted to wear, instead of one or more of the small scapulars a single <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medal</a> of metal. This <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medal</a> must have on one side a representation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> with His <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">Most Sacred Heart</a> and on the other an image of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>. All <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have been validly invested with a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> woollen scapular may replace such by this <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medal</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medal</a> must be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> possessing the faculty to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> and invest with the scapular or scapulars which the <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medal</a> is to replace. The faculties to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> these <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medals</a> are subject to the same conditions and limitations as the faculties to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> and invest with the corresponding scapulars. If the <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medal</a> is to be worn instead of a number of different scapulars, it must receive the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> that would be attached to each of them, i.e. as many <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> as the number of scapulars it replaces. For each <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> a <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the Cross</a> suffices. This <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medal</a> must also be worn constantly, either about the neck or in some other seemly manner, and with it may be attained all the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> and <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privileges</a> of the small scapulars without exception. Only the small (not the large) scapulars may be validly replaced by such <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medals</a>.
<h2 id="section6">The individual small scapulars</h2>
<h3 id="A">The Scapular of the Most Blessed Trinity</h3>

<p>The small white scapular, provided with the blue and red <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a>, is the badge of the members of the Confraternity of The Most <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a>. To <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, who sanctioned the <a href="../cathen/15045d.htm">Order of the Trinitarians</a> on 28 January, 1198, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is said to have appeared wearing a white garment and on his breast a <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a> of which the transverse shaft was blue and the longitudinal shaft red. The <a href="../cathen/15045d.htm">Trinitarians</a> were accordingly assigned this as their habit. When later the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> sought to associate themselves more closely with their order in <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternities</a> the <a href="../cathen/15045d.htm">Trinitarians</a> gave them as their outward badge the scapular described above. The red and blue <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a> is essential only on the front segment of woollen cloth which hangs before the breast. Each <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who joins the Confraternity of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a> must be invested with this scapular and must constantly wear it. The <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> of this <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> were last approved by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Congregation of Indulgences of 13 August, 1899. The General of the <a href="../cathen/15045d.htm">Trinitarians</a> may communicate to other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> the faculty of receiving into the <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> and of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> and investing with the scapular.
<h3 id="B">The Scapular of our Lady of Ransom (B. Maria V. de Mercede redemptionis captivorum)</h3>

<p>Like the <a href="../cathen/15045d.htm">Trinitariansy</a>, the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/10197b.htm">Order of Our Lady of Mercy for the Ransom of Prisoners</a> give the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> a special scapular on their entering the <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> erected by them. The order was founded by <a href="../cathen/11770b.htm">St. Peter Nolasco</a> (1256). The scapular is of white cloth, and bears on the front part, which hangs over the breast, the picture of <a href="../cathen/12640a.htm">Our Lady of Ransom</a>. The other part consists simply of a smaller segment of white cloth. The summary of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> was last approved by the Congregation of Indulgences on 30 July, 1868 (Rescr. auth. S. C. Indulg., pp. 483 sqq., n. 36). The General of the <a href="../cathen/10197b.htm">Mercedarians</a> communicates to other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> the faculty of receiving into the <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> and of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> and investing with the scapular. In the "Bullar. Ord. B.M.V.de Mercede" (Barcelona, 1696), p. 16, mention is made of a <a href="../cathen/04320a.htm">Constitution</a> of <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> issued at <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> on 25 March, 1263 granting afresh to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> who wear the scapular of the order (<em>habitum nostrum</em>) in the world many <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> and <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. We do no more than record this circumstance exactly as it is related in the "Bullarium". However, the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">encyclical</a> could not have been issued from <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> on 25 March, 1263, for <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> was at that time in <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>.
<h3 id="C">The Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel</h3>

<p>Also known as the Brown Scapular, this is the best known, most celebrated, and most widespread of the small scapulars. It is spoken of as "the Scapular", and the "feast of the Scapular" is that of <a href="../cathen/10604b.htm">Our Lady of Mount Carmel</a> on 16 July. It is probably the oldest scapular and served as the prototype of the others. According to a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> tradition the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> appeared to <a href="../cathen/13800a.htm">St. Simon Stock</a> at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge, England</a>, on Sunday, 16 July, 1251. In answer to his appeal for help for his oppressed order, she appeared to him with a scapular in her hand and said: "Take, beloved son this scapular of thy order as a badge of my <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> and for thee and all <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> a special sign of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; whoever dies in this garment, will not suffer <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>. It is the sign of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, a safeguard in dangers, a pledge of peace and of the covenant". This tradition, however, appears in such a precise form for the first time in 1642, when the words of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> were given in a circular of <a href="../cathen/13800a.htm">St. Simon Stock</a> which he is said to have dictated to his companion secretary, and confessor, Peter Swanyngton. Although it has now been sufficiently shown that this testimony cannot be supported by historical documents, still its general content remains a reliable <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> tradition; in other words, it is credible that <a href="../cathen/13800a.htm">St. Simon Stock</a> was assured in a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> manner of the special protection of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> for his whole order and for all who should wear the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> habit, that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> also promised him to grant special aid, especially in the <a href="../cathen/04660c.htm">hour of death</a>, to those who in holy fidelity wore this habit in her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> throughout life, so that they should be preserved from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. And, even though there is here no direct reference to the members of the scapular <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a>, indirectly the promise is extended to all who from <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to the Mother of God</a> should wear her habit or badge, like <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, until death, and be thus as it were affiliated to the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite Order</a>.

<p>Heretofore no authenticated testimony has been discovered proving that the small scapular was known from the second half of the thirteenth century and was given to the members of the Confraternity of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. On the contrary there are many reasons for the view that the small scapular, as we now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it and in the form it has certainly had since the sixteenth century, is of much later origin. Zimmerman (Mon. hist. Carmelit.) and Saltet give very reasonable grounds for this view. In any case, the scapular was very widespread in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> countries at the end of the sixteenth century, as is evident from "La cronica Carmelitana" of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Joseph Falcone (Piacenza, 1595). In 1600 appeared at <a href="../cathen/11419b.htm">Palermo</a> the "Giardino Carmelitano" of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Egidio Leoindelicato da Sciacca (the approval is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1592). Towards the end the author gives after the formulas of benediction for the Fratelli and Sorelle della Compagnia della Madonna del Carmine (who receive the complete habit of the order) the formula for the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of the scapular for the Devoti della Compagnia Carmelitana (pp. 239 sqq.). This is the earliest form of benediction for the small scapular with which we are acquainted. It is also noteworthy that the formula for the sisters contains no reference to the scapular, while in that for the brothers there is a special <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> for the scapular.

<p>Nevertheless, even should we admit that the small scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel originated even as late as the beginning of the sixteenth century, yet the above promise, which is designated the first <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Scapular, remains unimpaired. For this <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a> declares nothing else than that all those who out of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> veneration and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> constantly wear the scapular in a spirit of fidelity and confiding <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, after they have been placed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself with this habit or badge under the special protection of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, shall enjoy this special protection in the matter and crisis which most concerns them for <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Whoever, therefore, even though he be now a sinner, wears the badge of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> throughout life as her faithful servant, not <a href="../cathen/12403a.htm">presumptuously</a> relying on the scapular as on a <a href="../cathen/01443b.htm">miraculous amulet</a>, but trustfully confiding in the power and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, may securely hope that <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> will through her powerful and motherly <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a> procure for him all the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> and for perseverance in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Such is the meaning and importance of the first <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Scapular, which is wont to be expressed in the words: "whoever wears the scapular until death, will be preserved from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>".

<p>The second <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a> of the scapular otherwise known as the <a href="../cathen/13289b.htm">Sabbatine privilege</a>, may be briefly defined as meaning that <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary's</a> motherly assistance for her servants in the Scapular Confraternity will continue after death, and will find effect especially on Saturday (the day <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>), provided that the members fulfill faithfully the not easy conditions <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for obtaining <a href="../cathen/13289b.htm">this privilege</a>.

<p>As regards the external form of the scapular, it should consist of two segments of brown woollen cloth; black, however, is also admissible. This scapular usually bears on one side the image of our Lady of Mount Carmel, but neither this nor any other image is prescribed. The authentic list of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privileges</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indults</a> of the Scapular Confraternity of Mount Carmel was last approved on 4 July, 1908, by the Congregation of Indulgences. It is noteworthy that this summary says nothing of the above-mentioned first <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a>; what it says of the <a href="../cathen/13289b.htm">Sabbatine privilege</a> is explained in the article on that subject. Concerning the often <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> protection which <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> on account of this her badge has granted to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> members of the Scapular Confraternity in great perils of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, there exist many records and reliable reports (some of recent times), to which it is impossible to refuse credence. Like the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">rosary</a>, this scapular has become the badge of the devout <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> servant of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>.
<h3 id="D">The Black Scapular of the Seven Dolours of Mary</h3>

<p>Shortly after <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> had sanctioned the <a href="../cathen/13736a.htm">Servite Order</a> in 1255, many of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> of either sex associated themselves with the order in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternities</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14151b.htm">Seven Dolours of Mary</a>. The members of this Confraternity of the Seven Dolours of Mary also wore in later times a scapular which, like the habit of the order, had to be of black cloth. In other respects nothing is prescribed concerning this scapular, although it usually bears on the front portion (over the breast) an image of the Mother of Sorrows. This scapular must likewise be worn constantly, if one wishes to gain the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a>. The summary of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> was last approved by the Congregation of Indulgences on 7 March, 1888. <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Priests</a> may obtain from the General of the <a href="../cathen/13736a.htm">Servites</a> the faculty to receive the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> into the <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> and to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> and invest with the scapular.
<h3 id="E">The Blue Scapular of the Immaculate Conception</h3>

<p>The Venerable Ursula Benicasa, foundress of the Order of <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatine</a> Nuns, relates in her autobiography how the habit which she and her sisters were to wear in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07674d.htm">Immaculate Conception</a> was revealed to her in a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a>. When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> had in return promised great favours for her order, she begged the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> for all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who should devoutly wear a small sky-blue scapular in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07674d.htm">Immaculate Conception</a> and to secure the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of sinners. Her petition having been granted she herself disseminated such scapulars, after they had been <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. This <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a> bore such rich fruits that <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 30 January, 1671, expressly granted the faculty to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> and invest with this scapular. <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> granted certain <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> for the wearing of the scapular and succeeding <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> increased the number. The summary was approved by the Congregation of Indulgences first in 1845 and finally on 26 August 1882 (Rescr. auth. S. C. Indulg., pp. 574 sqq., n. 57). Only the blue woollen cloth is essential and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. The scapular usually bears on one portion a symbolization of the <a href="../cathen/07674d.htm">Immaculate Conception</a> and on the other the <a href="../cathen/09753a.htm">name of Mary</a>. In 1894 a <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> of the Immaculate Conception of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin and Mother of God Mary</a> was erected in the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatine</a> Church of S. Andrea della Valle at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In the same year it was endowed with various <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, and then raised to an <a href="../cathen/01692a.htm">archconfraterity</a> (cf. Analecta ecclesiastica, p. 189 sq.). According to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> admission is effected by the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> and investing with the Blue Scapular, the presentation of the small chaplet of the Immaculate Conception, and the enrolling of the <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">name</a> in the register of the <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a>. However those who received the scapular before 18 September, 1894, are not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to have themselves enrolled in the <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a>. Similarly, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who may have received the faculty only of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> and investing with the scapular may continue to exercise it at present <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who receive this faculty from the General of the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a>, receive simultaneously the faculty of admitting the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> into the <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> and must forward the <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">names</a> of those admitted to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> or to some other canonically erected <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> of this kind.
<h3 id="F">The Scapular of the Most Precious Blood</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Priests</a> who can receive the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> into the <a href="../cathen/12373b.htm">Confraternity of the Precious Blood</a> have also the faculty of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> and investing these with this red scapular (or a red girdle). No special <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, however, are connected with the wearing of this scapular, and the wearing of it is left optional to the members of the <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a>. For the scapular it is prescribed only that it be of red cloth. The scapular as used in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> bears on one portion a representation of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> with the Precious Blood <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; the other segment which hangs at the back is simply a smaller portion of red cloth.
<h3 id="G">The Black Scapular of the Passion</h3>

<p>It is related in the life of <a href="../cathen/11590a.htm">St. Paul of the Cross</a> that before founding the Congregation of the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a> he received in <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">apparitions</a> the black habit of the order with the badge on the breast. Later, after the foundation of the congregation, the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionist</a> Fathers gave the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who wished to associate themselves more closely with their order a black scapular in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a>. This bears an exact replica of the badge of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, namely a heart above a <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a>, on which is written "Jesu XPI Passio" and below "sit semper in cordibus nostris". The other portion of the scapular hanging at the back, consists simply of a small segment of black woollen cloth. At various times <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> have been granted to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who wear this scapular, the Summary being last approved by the Congregation of Indulgences on 10 May, 1877. The Superior-General of the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a> communicates to other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> the faculty to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> and invest with the scapular.
<h3 id="H">The Red Scapular of the Passion</h3>

<p>This scapular owes its origin to an <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">apparition</a> which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> vouchsafed to a <a href="../cathen/03605a.htm">Sister of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul</a> in 1846. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> showed the sister a scapular, such as is worn, and promised to all who should wear it on every Friday a great increase of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">apparition</a> having been several times repeated, and finally in the following year reported to <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, the latter sanctioned the scapular by a <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">Rescript</a> of 25 June, 1847, and granted the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Priests of the Mission</a> (the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>) the faculty of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> the scapular and investing the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> with it. He simultaneously granted many <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> for the wearing of the scapular. The Superior-General of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> can communicate the faculty of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> and investing with this scapular to other <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> or <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. The scapular and bands must both be of red woollen material. On one woollen segment <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is represented on the <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">Cross</a>; at the foot of the <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">Cross</a> are the implements of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, and about it are the words: "Holy Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ Save us." On the other are represented the Hearts of <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">Jesus</a> and <a href="../cathen/07168a.htm">Mary</a>, and above these a <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a> with the inscription: "Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, protect us." These images also are essential to the scapular (Acta S. Sedis XXX, 748).
<h3 id="I">Scapular of the Blessed Virgin Mary under the title of "Help of the Sick"</h3>

<p>In the Church of St. Magdalen at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, belonging to the <a href="../cathen/04051d.htm">Clerks Regular</a> of St. Camillus, a picture of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> is specially <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> under the title of Help of the Sick. This picture is said to have been <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> by the celebrated <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, <a href="../cathen/01483b.htm">Fra Angelico da Fiesole</a> and before it <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pope St. Pius V</a> is said to have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for the victory of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> fleet during the battle of <a href="../cathen/09181b.htm">Lepanto</a>. This picture suggested to a brother of the Order of St. Camillus. Ferdinand Vicari, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of founding a <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> under the invocation of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> for the poor sick. He succeeded in his plan, the <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> being canonically erected in the above-mentioned church on 15 June, 1860. At their reception, the members are given a scapular of black woollen cloth; the portion over the breast is a copy of the above picture of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> and at her feet Sts. <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> and Camillus, the two other <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patrons</a> of the sick and of the <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a>. On the small segment at the back is sewed a little red cloth <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a>; although this receives separate and special <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> for the sick, it does not constitute an essential portion of the scapular. The scapular is the badge of the <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a>, which received its <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> from <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> and <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in 1860 and 1883; these were last ratified by a <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">Rescript</a> of the Congregation of Indulgences, 21 July, 1883.
<h3 id="J">The Scapular of the Immaculate Heart of Mary</h3>

<p>This scapular originated with the Sons of the lmmaculate Heart of Mary in 1877, and was sanctioned and endowed with <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> on 11 May of that year. The scapular was later approved by the Congregation of Rites in 1907, and its form more exactly decreed; in the same year it was assigned new <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. The superior general of the above congregation can communicate to other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> the faculty of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> and investing with this scapular ("Acta Pontificia", <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, March 1911, appendix). The scapular is of white woollen cloth: on the portion which hangs before the breast is represented the burning <a href="../cathen/07168a.htm">heart of Mary</a>, out of which grows a lily; the <a href="../cathen/07168a.htm">heart</a> is encircled by a wreath of roses and pierced with a sword.
<h3 id="K">The Scapular of St. Michael the Archangel</h3>

<p>While this scapular originated under <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, who gave it his blessing, it was first formally approved under <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>. In 1878 a <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">St. Michael the Archangel</a> was founded in the Church of St. Eustachius at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and in the following year in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">Church</a> of Sant' Angelo in Pescheria (Sancti Angeli in foro Piscium). In 1880 <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> raised it to the rank of an <a href="../cathen/01692a.htm">archconfraternity</a>, which was expressly called the Archconfraternity of the Scapular of St. Michael. At first (1878) the <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> received <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> from <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> for seven years; the summary of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> of the Pious Association of St. Michael was last approved for ever by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Congregation of Indulgences, 28 March, 1903. The scapular is so associated with the <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> that each member is invested with it. The formula for <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> and investing with the scapular, given in the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Rituale Romanum</a> was first approved by the Congregation of Rites on 23 August, 1883. In outward form this scapular is different from the others, inasmuch as the two segments of cloth have the form of a small shield; of these one is made of blue and the other of black cloth, and of the bands likewise one is blue and the other black. Both portions of the scapular bear the well-known representation of the <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">Archangel St. Michael</a> slaying the dragon and the inscription "Quis ut Deus".
<h3 id="L">The Scapular of St. Benedict</h3>

<p>To associate the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, who were not Oblates of St. Benedict, in a certain measure with the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> of <a href="../cathen/02467b.htm">St. Benedict</a> was founded in the second half of the nineteenth century, at first by the English Congregation. Reception is effected by the enrollment of the members and investment with a small <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> scapular of black cloth. One of the segments usually has a picture of <a href="../cathen/02467b.htm">St. Benedict</a> but no picture is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> was endowed with <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> in 1882 and 1883.
<h3 id="M">The Scapular of the Mother of Good Counsel</h3>

<p>At the <a href="../cathen/11777a.htm">petition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Augustinian monks</a> this scapular was approved and endowed with <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Congregation of Rites of 19-21 December, 1893. The faculty of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> and investing with the scapular belongs primarily to the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Augustinian monks</a>, but the General of the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Augustinians</a> communicates this <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a> to other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The two segments of cloth must be of white wool, though the bands are usually also white, this is not essential. The segment of cloth which hangs before the breast bears the image of the Mother of Good Counsel (after the well-known picture in the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Augustinian</a> church at Genazzano) with the inscription: "Mother of Good Counsel". On the other segment the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/07243a.htm">arms</a> (i.e., the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">keys</a> of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>) with the inscription: "Son, follow her counsel. <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Leo III</a>".
<h3 id="N">The Scapular of St. Joseph</h3>

<p>This scapular was approved for the <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Diocese of Verona</a> by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Congregation of Rites of 8 July, 1880. On 15 April, 1898, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> granted to the General of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> the faculty of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> and investing the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> everywhere with this scapular. From the <a href="../cathen/13341a.htm">Diocese of St-Claude</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> this scapular (at first white) was spread by the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> (cf. Analecta ord. Min. Capuc., IX, 1893, pp. 161 sqq.); but it was later decreed that the shape and colour of that used in <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> should be used. Nevertheless, owing to a mistake, a slight difference crept in, and it was expressly declared later by the Congregation of Indulgences that the scapular might be lawfully retained in the form now customary among the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>. In this form, the two segments of woollen cloth are of a violet colour; to these are sewed two pieces of gold-coloured material (linen, cotton, etc.) of equal size. On the gold-coloured segment before the breast is the representation of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">St. Joseph</a> with the Child <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> on his right arm and the staff of lilies in his left hand, while underneath is the inscription: "St. Joseph, patron of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us." On the other gold-coloured segment is represented the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">papal crown</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a>, above it the dove as the symbol of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and underneath it a <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">keys</a> of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> with the inscription: "Spiritus Domini ductor eius" (The Spirit of the Lord is his Guide). The bands are white. This scapular having been approved by the Congregation of Rites on 18 April, 1893, various <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> were granted for all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who wear it by a <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">Rescript</a> of the Congregation of Indulgences, 8 June, 1893 ("Acta S. Sedis", XXXIV, 317).
<h3 id="O">The Scapular of The Most Sacred Heart of Jesus</h3>

<p>The constant wearing of a small picture of the <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">Heart of Jesus</a> was already recommended by <a href="../cathen/09653a.htm">Blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque</a>, who herself made and distributed them. They were made of a small piece of white woollen cloth, on which was <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidered</a> or sewed in red a picture of the <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">Heart of Jesus</a>. This badge was especially employed during the plague at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> as a protection against the pest. During the terrors of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> it also served as a safeguard for the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Although this badge is often called a scapular, it is not really such; consequently the conditions governing scapulars do not apply to it. It was only in 1872 that an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> was granted by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> for the wearing of this badge. A real scapular of the Sacred Heart was first introduced in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1876 when it was approved by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Congregation of Rites and a special formula for <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> and investing with it appointed 4 April, 1900. This scapular consists of two segments of white woollen cloth connected in the usual manner by two strings; one segment bears the usual representation of the <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">Sacred Heart</a>, while the other bears that of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> under the title of Mother of Mercy. By a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 10 July, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> granted many <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> wearing of this scapular.
<h3 id="P">The Scapular of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary</h3>

<p>This is very similar to the Red Scapular of the Passion. Like the Scapulars of the Heart of Jesus, it was approved at the request of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Congregation of Rites, 4 April, 1900. The two segments of cloth are of white wool, one bears the image of the <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">Heart of Jesus</a> with the well-known emblems and also the <a href="../cathen/07168a.htm">Heart of Mary</a> pierced with a sword, underneath being the implements of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>; the other segment has a small <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a> of red material. <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a> were granted for the wearing of this scapular in 1901, and increased by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> in 1906. The scapular owes its origin and spread to the Congregation of the Daughters of the Sacred Heart, founded at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> in 1873 (<a href="../cathen/01111c.htm">Acta S. Sedis</a>, XXXII, 633 sq.)
<h3 id="Q">The Scapular of St. Dominic</h3>

<p>On 23 November, 1903, this scapular was endowed by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> with an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of 300 days in favour of all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who wear it, as often as they devoutly <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> it. The scapular is thereby also approved. It is made of white wool, but the bands, as in the case of so many other scapulars may be of another material. No image is prescribed for the scapular, but the scapular given in the house of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> General at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> has on one side the picture of <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">kneeling</a> before the <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">crucifix</a> and on the other that of B. Reginald receiving the habit from the hands of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>. The General of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> communicates to other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> the faculty of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> and investing with the scapular ("The Booklet of the Faculties", Rome, 1909).
<h3 id="R">The Scapular of the Holy Face</h3>

<p>This scapular bears on a piece of white cloth the well-known picture connected with <a href="../cathen/15362a.htm">St. Veronica</a>. This scapular is worn by the members of the Archconfraternity of the Holy Face. The members can, however, wear the picture on a <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medal</a> or <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a>, in place of the scapular. The wearing of this picture is simply one of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> practices of the <a href="../cathen/01692a.htm">archconfraternity</a>, without any special <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>.
