<h1>Schenute</h1>  

<p>(SCHENUDI, SCHNUDI, SINUTHIUS).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. The years 332-33-34 and 350 are mentioned as the date of his birth, and the years 451-52 and 466 as the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death, all authors agreeing that he lived about 118 years. He was born at Schenalolet in the district of Akhim, and died in his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, which still exists under the name of Deir-el-Abiad (White Monastery), near the ruins of the village of Atripe. In 371, he became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at this large <a href="../cathen/10452a.htm">double monastery</a>, which was then ruled by his uncle Bgol, whom he succeeded as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> in 388. <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a>, whom he accompanied to the Council of Ephesus in 431, appointed him <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrite</a> during that council. The <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> him as a saint and as the Father of the Coptic Church.

<p>The monastic rule of Pachomius underwent various modifications and was made more severe under the abbey of Bgol and Schenute. Perhaps the most important modification was the introduction of <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> into the monastic life. Each <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> made a solemn profession in the church, that he would faithfully observe the rule of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The formula of this <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, as prescribed by Schenute, was published by Leipoldt (loc. cit. below p. 107), and by Leclercq in Dict. d'Arch&eacute;ologie chr&eacute;t." s.v. C&eacute;nobitisme. It is as follows: "I <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> [<em>homologein</em>] before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His holy place as the word of my tongue is my witness: I shall never sully my body in any way; I shall not steal; I shall not take <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a>; I shall not lie; I shall not do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> secretly. If I transgress what I have sworn [<em>homologein</em>] I shall not enter the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> before whom I pronounce the formula of this pledge [<em>diatheke</em>] will thrust me body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell-fire</a>, for I shall have trangressed the formula of the pledge [<em>diatheke</em>] have pronounced" (op. cit.) It is the first <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of which we have any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Another modification of the rule of Pachomius was a combination of the cenobitic with the anchoretic life. Schenute was the most influential monastic head and perhaps the most powerful man in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> during his time. Besa, his biographer and successor as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Atripe, states that at one time he ruled over 2200 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and 1800 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. But Schenute was too self-conscious, passionate, and tyrannical, his rule too severe, and his enforcement of it too violent, to make his influence wholesome and lasting. Outside of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> he remained unknown; neither Latin nor Greek writers make any mention of him. Philosophy he considered useless, and his whole <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> consisted in the repetition of the current <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> formulas. Extremely austere with himself, he required the same austerity of his disciples, and rigidly enforced an absolute submission to his authority. His literary works, written in the Sahidic language, consist chiefly of letters to <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, spiritual exhortations, and some very forcible sermons. They are being edited with a Latin translation by Leipoldt, in "Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium" (Paris, 1906) and, with a French translation, by Am&eacute;lineau in the same publication (Paris, 1907-.)
