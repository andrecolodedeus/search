<h1>Schleswig</h1>  

<p>Formerly a duchy and diocese of northwestern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, now a part of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Province of Schleswig-Holstein. In the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the southern part of the peninsula of Jutland was a bone of contention between the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> and the Danes. When in the fifth century the greater part of the Germanic population had left the region in order to seek a new home in Britain, the Danes or Jutes pushed their way into the country and the part of the Germanic population that had remained behind amalgamated with the new masters. The Frisians were the only ones to retain their national peculiarities after losing their national independence. About the beginning of the ninth century <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> conquered the southernmost part of the peninsula; he formed the territory on the Eider into a <em>Mark</em> as a protection against the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>. As early as his reign <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missions began to gain a foothold in the region. The first preacher of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a> was the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Atrebanus, who was a Pupil of Willehad, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>. Atrebanus founded a mission station among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> Dithmarschians, but suffered the death of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> during the Saxon revolt in 780. During the reign of Louis the Pious, Archbishop Ebo of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> the emperor's confidential friend, re-established the mission, but without great success. About 850 Ebo's companion, Ansgar the Apostle of the North, erected the first church in the little town of Schleswig; this was soon followed in 860 by the building of the church at Ripen. These successes of the mission of the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> period were destroyed during the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> reaction that followed. Under the vigorous administration of the German king, Henry I, the Mark on the Eider was re-established in 934, and soon after this Unni, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, once more took in hand the bringing of the north to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities increased, especially after the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> <a href="../cathen/07141b.htm">King Harold Blue Tooth</a> (d. 986) had accepted <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and the three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Schleswig, Ripen, and Aarhaus were founded at the request of Archbishop Adaldag of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>. These <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were made suffragans of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Schleswig was Hored, who was present in 948 at the German synod of Ingelheim. The Diocese of Schleswig, though, did not include the whole of the later Duchy of Schleswig, as the north-western part belonged to the Diocese of Ripen, and the Islands of Alsen, Ar&ouml; and Fehmarn to the Diocese of Funen.

<p>During the reign of <a href="../cathen/07141b.htm">King Harold Blue Tooth</a>, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> became the dominating religion of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and Schleswig. <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Paganism</a>, however, regained the supremacy when Harold's son Sven with the Forked Beard, who had been a viking, returned home in 985 and overthrew his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were ill-treated, the Diocese of Aarhaus was suppressed, and the two other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were driven away. Yet in the last years of his life Sven with the Forked Beard turned to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and his son Canute the Great, who by the conquest of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> created a great northern empire, established <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> at last in his territories. In 1035 his son-in-law the German King Conrad II gave him the Mark of Schleswig as compensation for the alliance he had maintained with <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> for many years. The Mark included the territory between the Eider, Schlei, and Treene. The political separation from the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> was soon followed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>. Canute had reorganized the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> Church and had divided it into nine <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. In 1103 or 1104 a separate <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> archdiocese was erected at <a href="../cathen/09433a.htm">Lund</a> for all these <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, and, notwithstanding the protests of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, Schleswig was made a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/09433a.htm">Lund</a>. Before long the political union with <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> was weakened again. From the time that the whole of Schleswig belonged to <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> it was ruled by royal governors; these governors were generally princes of the royal house who grew steadily more independent of the king. In 1115 Knut Laward was able to gain the viceregency of Schleswig in fief from the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> King Niels, and was also made duke of this territory. Thus a basis was laid for a more independent position of the province within the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. Under Knut's successors Schleswig was often united with <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, as Waldemar I and II, dukes of Schleswig, were also kings of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. These kings, however, sought to keep Schleswig as their personal domain, separate from the administration of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. In 1231 Abel, the youngest son of Waldemar II, was granted the duchy; he founded an independent ducal line that ruled the duchy for over a hundred and fifty years.

<p>Both politically and ecclesiastically the two centuries following tire reign of Knut Laward form the most prosperous period of the province. Of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Alberus (1096-1134), in particular, was very active in his office, and laboured among the Frisians who had been conquered by Knut. The diocese received large grants of land from Waldemar I, possessions that were scattered through all parts, of the duchy; in 1187 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was released from all payment of imposts and taxes to the king. A number of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> arose that did much for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and material development of the country; nearly thirty <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to have existed in the period before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The most important of these were the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of Lugumkloster, Guldhom, and Schleswig, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. John for <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> at Schleswig, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at Hadersleben, Tondern, and Schleswig, and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Schleswig. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> many of these <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> had obtained large landed possessions, When in 1325 Duke Eric II died and left a minor son Waldemar V, King Christopher II of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> wished to become the guardian and thus gain control of the duchy. However, the powerful Count Gerhard III of Holstein of the Schauenburg line, who was an uncle of Waldemar, and also the latter's guardian, opposed the king. Gerhard gained control of the government, and drove Christopher out of his own kingdom. Waldemar V was elected King of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and in return gave the Duchy of Schleswig to his uncle, the Count of Holstein. Thus the duchies Schleswig and Holstein became united at the same time (1326) Waldemar made a law, called the &quot;Constitutio Waldemariana&quot;, by which in future the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> could never be the ruler both of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and Schleswig. During the troubles caused by the return of the banished King Christopher the Counts of Holstein were not able to maintain their control of the Duchy of Schleswig. It was not until the era of Gerhard VI, the grandson of Gerhard III (assassinated 1340), that the counts of Holstein regained possession of Schleswig; Gerhard VI was granted the duchy in fief by Queen Margaret of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, and in 1403 gain possession of almost the whole of the duchy of Holstein on account of the extinction of the line of Kiel. Since this time Schleswig has always been united with Holstein which was a state of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>.



<p>On the death in 1459 of Adolf VII, son of Gerhard VI, the line of the counts of Schauenburg became extinct, and the estates of Schleswig and of Holstein elected in 1460 as duke and count the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> King Christian of the Oldenburg dynasty, who was the son of Adolf's sister. The new duke and count, though, was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to swear that both countries should be &quot;forever undivided&quot;, and that they should be independent of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> in their internal administration and constitution. Thus both territories were united by personal union with <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, the Duchy, of Schleswig (which had been a <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> fief), and the Countship of Holstein, which in 1474 was also raised to a duchy by the Emperor Frederick III. In spite of this union with <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> both territories remained German in character; the language of the courts and official documents was German, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the cities was German, the nobility was German, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and chapter of the Diocese of Schleswig were chosen from German <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. The close <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> union with <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> was still further promoted by the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, which in Schleswig as in the whole of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> was largely the work of the rulers. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Schleswig of that period, Gottschalk of Ahlefeld (1527-41), fearlessly opposed, indeed, the intrusion of the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, but his efforts had little success. For in the course of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, especially during the rule of the counts of Holstein, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had ceased to be independent of the dukes; from vassals of the king they had become vassals of the dukes and had sunk into mere local <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. In 1536 <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> was declared the religion of the state by Christian III, the exercise of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was forbidden, and the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was confiscated. After Gottschalk's death Tileman of Hussen was appointed in 1541 the first <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Schleswig. He was followed by four other <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, after which the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was suppressed in 1624. While the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was entirely suppressed in Schleswig, in Holstein a few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communities were permitted to remain in existence. In the seventeenth century <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> services were allowed to be held again in a few places. In 1667 all these <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communities were placed under the care of the newly-established Vicariate Apostolic of the Northern Missions, and shared its vicissitudes.

<p>In 1544 the two duchies were divided between the three sons of the king and Duke Frederick I (d. 1533). The basis of the division was this: three equal portions were formed for the three brothers out of the duchies, which portions were named after the castles of Sonderburg, Gottorp, and Hadersleben, while the courts, the system of taxation, the army, and the diets that were held at Flensburg for Schleswig, and at Kiel for Holstein, remained in common. When in 1580 the Hadersleben line became extinct, another division was made, the possessions of the Hadersleben line being divided between King <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> and Duke Adolf of Holstein-Gottorp (1581). After this there were two lines: the royal, which was called Schleswig-Holstein-Gl&uuml;ckstadt after the seat of administration for the duchies, and from which in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> several branches sprang; second, a ducal line called the Gottorp, line which, besides sharing in the two duchies, also owned the former Diocese of Lubeck. Duke Frederick III of Gottorp, who ruled from 1616 to 1659, put an end to the subdivisions of the Gottorp line by introducing primogeniture. During the eighteenth century the two ruling dynasties were generally hostile to each other because the Gottorp line sought alliance with Sweden, the enemy of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. Thus the duchies became involved in the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> and the two <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the North. In the Treaty of Roeskilde that closed the first <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the North, the Gottorp dynasty received, through the intervention of <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, full sovereignty by the suppression of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark's</a> suzerainty over its share of the duchies. However, in the Treaty of Stockholm that in 1720 closed the second <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the North, which had not been fortunate for Sweden, the Gottorp line was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to concede its share of Schleswig to <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and only retained its possessions in Holstein. The whole of Schleswig was now <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to recognize the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> king as its ruler. In the treaties of 1767 and 1773 the Gottorp dynasty, which had gained the throne of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Peter III, was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to renounce its possessions in Holstein also, in return for which it received Oldenburg. In this way <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> became the sole ruler of Schleswig-Holstein.

<p>The union of the two duchies with the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> grew continually weaker, especially as after the dissolution of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> in 1806 the duchies had no protection against the policy. of their ruler; this policy, which was to stamp a <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> character upon them, was not affected by the fact that the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> made Holstein a part of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. The Danes showed plainly more and more their determination to separate the two duchies, which by right should never have been divided, and to gain at least Schleswig as a part of the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> nation, because the population of Schleswig was largely <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> in speech. The people, however, accepted all the measures of the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> government very composedly, as the male line of the royal dynasty would soon be extinct and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> line was, by the Salic law of succession, not capable of succeeding in the duchies, although it could in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. The duchies were satisfied even with the constitution granted in 1834, although it was not one in common for both duchies and did not preserve any essential right of the people. King Christian, however, in 1846 published a letter in which he declared the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> right of succession to be also valid in the duchies, and his successor Frederick VIII (1848-63) was forced by popular assemblies at <a href="../cathen/04352a.htm">Copenhagen</a>, soon after he came to the throne, to promise the incorporation of Schleswig into the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> kingdom. These two events were followed by a revolt of the people of the duchies. On 24 March, 1848, a temporary provincial government was established at Kiel, which declared that it assumed for the time being in the name of the ruler, the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> king, the maintenance of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of both duchies, as the ruler had been forced by mob rule to take a hostile position to the duchies. When, upon this, <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> sent troops into Schleswig-Holstein, not only did the population of the duchies take up arms, but there was also a great national movement in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in favour of their endangered countrymen in the North. Volunteers from all parts of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> went to the aid of the people of Schleswig-Holstein. King Frederick William IV of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> sent an army into the duchies and even the Diet of the German Confederation was carried away by the national enthusiasm. It proclaimed that Schleswig was made a member of the German Confederation and gave to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> the direction of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> troops and those of the confederation won, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, several brilliant victories, especially the carrying of the fortifications of Duppel. However, the lack of a German fleet, and the threatened interference of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and Great Britain led <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> to consent to a truce, which was followed by a treaty in 1850 that was also accepted by the German Confederation. Contrary to the general promise that the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the duchies should be respected, they were again given to <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. After this the five Great Powers declared at a conference held at <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> in 1852, that the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> Kingdom was indivisible in all its parts, that the separate position of the duchies should be maintained within this kingdom, and that should the male line of the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> dynasty become extinct the succession was to fall to the House of Gl&uuml;cksburg. In this way the right of succession previously valid in the duchies of the Elbe was thrown aside, and the Augustenburg line, that had branched off from the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> royal house in the sixteenth century, was excluded from the succession to Schleswig Holstein. Consequently the German Confederation and Frederick, Crown prince of Augustenburg, protested against the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> protocol, while <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> recognized it.

<p>After the duchies were handed over to <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> there was an energetic attempt, especially in Schleswig, to make these provinces entirely <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> in character. All connexion with Holstein was set aside, a custom-house was erected on the Eider, <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> preachers, teachers, and troops were sent into Schleswig, while the German soldiers and officers were brought into <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> garrisons, and lastly <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> was made the language of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. When the male line of the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> royal family became extinct at the death of Frederick VII (15 November, 1863), according to the regulations of the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> protocol Christian of Gl&uuml;cksburg succeeded as Christian IX. Immediately after his accession Christian announced a constitution which included the unconditional incorporation of Schleswig into <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. The proclamation of this Constitution of November was followed in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> by unprecedented excitement and manifestations of disapproval, and the demand was made for the complete separation of the duchies from <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. Holstein was occupied by the troops of the German Confederation; even <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> now took the part of the duchies. These powers called upon <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> to withdraw the Constitution of November, and when these demands were rejected they sent <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> and Austrian troops under the command of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Field Marshal Wrangel into Schleswig in Feb., 1864. After the fortifications of Duppel, the Island of Alsen, and the entire peninsula of Jutland had been gained by the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> the Danes saw themselves compelled to yield. In the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (October, 1864) King Christian renounced all <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> over Schleswig and Holstein in favour of the Emperor of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and the King of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, and recognized in advance whatever disposition the two monarchs should make of these provinces. The possession in common of the duchies only increased the strain of the relations existing between <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> desired to form a new state of the German Confederation under the government of the Duke of Augustenburg, while <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, on the contrary, preferred to keep the region for itself and only permit the country to have a ruler of its own if all traffic, all customs, and the army of the new state were under the control of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. The Prince of Augustenburg would not consent to such an arrangement. In the Treaty of Gastein of 14 Aug., 1865, the duchies were divided between the two powers. <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> took in charge the administration of Holstein, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> that of Schleswig. It was seen from the start that this solution of the question could not be of long duration. The tension between the two powers for pre-eminence in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> led in the next year to a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between them. <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> was defeated, was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to withdraw from the German Confederation and to renounce all <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to Schleswig and Holstein in favour of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. From 1867 the two duchies have formed the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> province of Schleswig-Holstein (see <a href="../cathen/06529a.htm">VICARIATE APOSTOLIC OF NORTHERN GERMANY</a>).
