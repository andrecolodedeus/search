<h1>Schola Cantorum</h1>  

<p>A place for the teaching and practice of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> chant, or a body of singers banded together for the purpose of rendering the music in church. In the primitive Church the singing was done by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, but, in order to set them free from this and enable them to give their attention more to what strictly pertained to their office, trained singers for the musical part of the liturgy were introduced. Pope Hilary (d. 438) is sometimes credited with having inaugurated the first <em>schola cantorum</em>, but it was <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a>, as we are told in his life by <a href="../cathen/08491a.htm">John the Deacon</a>, who established the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> on a firm basis and endowed it. The house in which the <em>schola</em> was lodged was rebuilt in 844 by <a href="../cathen/13728c.htm">Pope Sergius II</a>, who had himself been trained in it, as were also the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> <a href="../cathen/13728b.htm">Sergius I</a>, <a href="../cathen/06787a.htm">Gregory II</a>, <a href="../cathen/14288c.htm">Stephen III</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11577a.htm">Paul I</a>. This Roman <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> furnished the choir at most of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> functions and was governed by an official called <em>prior scholae cantorum</em> or simply <em>cantor.</em> From Cardinal Thomasi's preface to the twelfth-century Vatican <a href="../cathen/01576b.htm">antiphonary</a>, we learn that, amongst his other <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, he had "to point out to each individual, the day before, what <a href="../cathen/12787a.htm">responsory</a> he was to sing in the night office". From <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the institution spread to other parts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Pepin, the father of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, first introduced Roman chanters into <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, placing them at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> encouraged the work, and through his influence several other <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were established in his empire. That of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> became one of the most famous; other well-known ones were at <a href="../cathen/07363a.htm">Hirschau</a>, Corbie, and St. Gall. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the diffusion of he Roman chant was due chiefly to St. Benet Biscop and <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a>. Several of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> (e.g. York, Sarum, <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>) and many of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> (e.g. Glastonbury and Malmesbury) had important <em>scholae cantorum</em> attached to them. The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant Reformation</a> put an end to the English <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, while abroad they seem to have died out when paid singers began to be employed in the churches, though perhaps the <em>ma&icirc;trise</em> or <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> choir-school of today may be regarded as their legitimate successor. In <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at the present day the name <em>schola cantorum</em> is often applied to certain selected <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it is to chant the more elaborate portions of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> music, such as the graduals and <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">alleluias</a> at Mass, the rest of the community joining only in the simpler parts. The official in charge of such a <em>schola</em> is usually called the "precentor". In recent times the chief <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> chant have been at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a>, Beuron, and, greatest of all, <a href="../cathen/14133b.htm">Solesmes</a>. In these the study of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and the work of restoring the traditional chant of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> have been pursued with much success. The <em>schola</em> of <a href="../cathen/14133b.htm">Solesmes</a> was commenced by <a href="../cathen/07058a.htm">Dom Gu&eacute;ranger</a> and has been ably carried on by his successors, DD. Pothier and Mocquereau. The latter is <a href="../cathen/12372a.htm">precentor</a> at <a href="../cathen/14133b.htm">Solesmes</a> (now in the Isle of Wight, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>), while the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> commission entrusted with the work of preparing the official Vatican edition of the Chant is presided over by Abbot Pothier. (See PROSPER LOUIS PASCHAL GUERANGER; <a href="../cathen/14133b.htm">SOLESMES</a>).
