<h1>School Sisters of Notre Dame</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community devoted to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. In the United Sates they have conducted <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> in numerous <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdioceses</a> and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>; they have also operated <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07123a.htm">Diocese of Hamilton</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>; an Indian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Harbor Springs, Michigan; a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for black children at Annapolis; and a deaf-mute institute in <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>. Their principal boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are: Baltimore, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>; Fort Lee, New Jersey; Quincy, Illinois; Longwood, <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>; Prairie Du Chien, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>. Of their day and high schools the most prominent are at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, Quincy, Longwood and Chatawa, Mississippi.

<p>The School Sisters of Notre Dame are a branch of the Congregation of Notre-Dame founded in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, by <a href="../cathen/11767b.htm">St. Peter Fourier</a> in 1597. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the congregations were established in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The one at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> was suppressed at the beginning of the nineteenth century, but it was soon restored and remodeled to meet the needs of modern times. <a href="../cathen/15679a.htm">Bishop Wittmann</a> of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> and Father Job of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> effected the change. While retaining the essential features of the rule and constitutions given by <a href="../cathen/11767b.htm">St. Peter Fourier</a>, they widened the scope of the Sisters' <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work. In 1834 their community consisted of one former pupil of the suppressed congregation, Caroline Gerhardinger, who became first Superior General (Mother Theresa of Jesus), and a few companions. The first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> was in Neunburg vorm Wald, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. In 1839 they removed to a suburb of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and in 1843, into a former <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clare</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, built in 1284, and situated within the city limits. From this motherhouse in the year 1847 six School Sisters of Notre Dame, on the invitation of Bishop O'Connor of <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to America and landed at New York on 31 July. One of the Sisters succumbed to the heat of the season and died at <a href="../cathen/07143a.htm">Harrisburg</a>, Pa., on the journey from New York to St. Mary's, Elk Co., Pa., destined to be the foundation-house in America. As St. Mary's was not the place for a permanent location the mother-general successfully negotiated to obtain the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> attached to St. James' Church, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> By 3 November, 1847, three <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were opened. The second and last colony of sisters, eleven in number, arrived from <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 25 March, 1848, and foundations were made at <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, Philadelphia, and <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>.

<p>On 15 December, 1850, the motherhouse was transferred to <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, with Mother Mary Caroline Friess as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the sisters in America. With money donated by King Louis I of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, a house was bought; this was absorbed later by Notre Dame Convent on St. Mary's Hill. On 2 January, 1851, St. Mary's <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was opened and St. Mary's Institute for boarding and day pupils soon afterwards. On 31 July, 1876, owing to its growth and extension, the congregation was divided into two provinces; the Western, with motherhouse at <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>; and the Eastern with motherhouse at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. A second division of the Western province became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, and on 19 March, 1895, the Southern province was formed, with its motherhouse in St. Louis.
<h2>Training of members</h2>

<p>To train members for their future life the School Sisters have a candidature and a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. The age for admission into the candidature is sixteen to twenty-seven. After two years' probation and study, the candidate enters the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, and two years later makes temporal vows and becomes a professed sister. The teaching sisters meet at specified periods and at appointed houses of the order for <a href="../cathen/14334a.htm">summer schools</a> and teachers' institutes. The principal houses of the congregation in the Western province are at Elm Grove, Waukesha County, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, the home for aged, invalid, and convalescent sisters; at Prairie du Chien, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, founded in 1872, chartered in 1877, owing its origin to the generosity of Hon. John Lawler (died on 24 Feb, 1891) and his son, Thomas C. Lawler, of <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>; at Longwood, <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, established and chartered in 1872. In 1903 the Legislature of Illinois granted the academy the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to add a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> courses and confer the degrees of A.B. and Ph.B. In the Eastern province at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, Md., chartered in 1864, charter amended and powers of corporation enlarged in 1896. The sisters began their work in Baltimore in 1848; owing to the growth of their academy, more commodious quarters became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, Notre Dame of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, was transferred in 1873 to a magnificent estate of seventy acres obtained in the suburbs. To meet the continual demand for a more extensive curriculum for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, the sisters of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> applied in January, 1896, to the State for the power of conferring academic degrees; this was granted by an Act of the Legislature, 2 April, 1896, and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> opened a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> with courses leading to the baccalaureate, an academy to prepare students for the college, and a grammar and primary department. There is a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Fort Lee on the Palisades of the Hudson, Bergen County, N.J. where a residence was purchased by the sisters on 2 October, 1879, the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> being opened on 21 November, 1879, and chartered in June, 1890. In the Southern province the principal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are at Quincy, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, founded on 28 December, 1859, as a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, the academy opened in September, 1867; at Chatawa, <a href="../cathen/10394a.htm">Mississippi</a>, founded on 15 October, 1874, a deaf-mute institution; at Chincuba, La., founded by Canon Mignot, 1 October, 1890, given in charge of the sisters on 25 September, 1892. Most prominent among the sisters in America was Mother M. Caroline Friess, who died on 22 July, 1892, after being superioress of the congregation for forty-two years. She was born near <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, on 24 August, 1824, and was called at <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by the name of Josephine. As a child she was brought to Eichstadt, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, under the tutelage of her uncle, Msgr. Michael Friess. Even when only a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> she was given charge of very important <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>. She was one of the first to volunteer for the missionary work in the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to America in 1847. It soon became evident that it was Sister Caroline who was to develop the young congregation. She was appointed vicar of the mother-general in America and later on elected at the first commissary-general. Under her direction from four members in 1847, the sisterhood grew to two thousand in 1892. Her life was written by Msgr. P.M. Abbelen. Mother M. Clara Heuck was the third commissary-general. When the Eastern province was established in 1876 Sister M. Clara was appointed as <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> mistress. Soon she became the superioress in <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> and the second mother provincial in the East, which position she held for three terms, after which she was elected commissary-general at <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a> on 13 May, 1899. She died at <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a> on 4 August, 1905, aged sixty-two.
