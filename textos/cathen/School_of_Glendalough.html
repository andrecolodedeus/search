<h1>School of Glendalough</h1>  

<p>Glendalough (the Valley of the Two Lakes) is a picturesque and lonely glen in the heart of the Wicklow Mountains. The fame of its <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> is chiefly due to its founder, <a href="../cathen/04092c.htm">St. Kevin</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/09091b.htm">Laurence O'Toole</a>, the last of the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. <a href="../cathen/04092c.htm">Kevin</a> (Irish <em>Coemghen</em>, the fair-begotten) was born near Rathdrum towards the close of the fifth century, and lived to the age of 120 years. His earliest tutor was St. Petroc of Cornwall, who had come to Leinster about 492, and devoted himself with considerable ardour to the study of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>, in which his pupil also became proficient. <a href="../cathen/04092c.htm">Kevin</a> next studied under his uncle, St. Eugenius, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ardstraw, who at that time lived at Kilnamanagh in Wicklow, where he taught his pupils all the sacred learning which he had acquired in the famous British <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Rosnat.

<p>Young <a href="../cathen/04092c.htm">Kevin</a> was at this <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> a handsome youth, and had unconsciously won the affections of a beautiful maiden, who once followed him to the woods. The young saint perceiving her, threw himself into a bed of nettles, and then gathering a handful scourged the maiden with the burning weeds. "The fire without", says the biographer, "extinguished the fire within", and Kathleen repenting became a saint. There is no foundation for the story, which <a href="../cathen/10553b.htm">Moore</a> has wedded to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> verse, that <a href="../cathen/04092c.htm">Kevin</a> flung the unhappy Kathleen from his cave, in the face of Ludguff, into the depths of the lake below. <a href="../cathen/04092c.htm">Kevin</a> then retired into the wilds of the Glendalough valley, where he spent many years in a narrow cave, living alone with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the practice of extreme <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">asceticism</a>. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> gathered round him, and induced him to build the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, whose ruins still remain lower down in the more open valley to the east. Here his fame as a saint and scholar attracted crowds of <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, so that Glendalough became for the east of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> what the Arran Islands were for the west &#151; a great <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of sacred learning, and a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in which the young <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were trained in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and self-denial.

<p>One of the most celebrated of the pupils of <a href="../cathen/04092c.htm">St. Kevin</a> at Glendalough was St. Moling, founder of the well-known <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> called from him St. Mullins on the left bank of the Barrow in the southwest of the County Carlow. Like his master <a href="../cathen/04092c.htm">Kevin</a>, he was a man of learning and extreme austerity, living, it is said, for a long time, as <a href="../cathen/04092c.htm">Kevin</a> did, in a hollow tree. He was also an elegant writer both in Latin and in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>. Several <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> poems have been attributed to him, his prophecies were in wide circulation, and the "Yellow Book of St. Moling" was one of those which Keating had in his hands, but which has since been unfortunately lost. Of all the scholars of Glendalough, however, St. Laurence O'Toole was by far the most distinguished. A great scholar, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, patriot, and saint, he owed his entire training in virtue and in learning to this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. So far did he carry his devotion to <a href="../cathen/04092c.htm">St. Kevin</a> that, even after he had become <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, he made it a practice to retire from the city, and spend the whole <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> in the very cave in the face of the rock over the lake where <a href="../cathen/04092c.htm">St. Kevin</a> had lived so long alone with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>The existing ruins at Glendalough still form a very striking scene in that wildly beautiful mountain valley. Within the area of the original enclosure are the great church, a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, built probably in the time of <a href="../cathen/04092c.htm">St. Kevin</a>, a fine round tower still 110 feet in height, the building called St. Kevin's <em>Cro</em> or kitchen, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, for whom <a href="../cathen/04092c.htm">Kevin</a>, like most of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, had a particular devotion. The building called St. Kevin's kitchen was doubtless the private oratory and sleeping chamber of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, the latter being in the croft overhead, as in St. Columba's house at <a href="../cathen/08615a.htm">Kells</a>.
