<h1>School of Lismore</h1>  

<p>As the School of Armagh in the North of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and that of Clonmacnoise in the centre, so the School of <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a> was the most celebrated in the South of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. It was founded in the year 635 by <a href="../cathen/03384c.htm">St. Carthach the Younger</a>, in a most picturesque site, steeply rising from the southern bank of the Blackwater. Its founder had spent nearly forty years of his monastic life in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Rahan on the southern borders of ancient Meath, in what is now King's County. He dearly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> that <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which he had founded and which he fondly hoped would be the place of his <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>; but the men of <a href="../cathen/10097a.htm">Meath</a> &mdash; <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and chieftains &mdash; grew jealous of the great <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> founded in their territory by a stranger from Munster, and they persuaded Prince Blathmac, son of Aedh Slaine, of the southern Hy Mall, to expel the venerable old man from the monastic home which he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> so well. The eviction is described by the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalists</a> as most <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> and cruel, yet, under <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> guidance, it led to the foundation of <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a> on the beautiful margin of what was then called Avonmore, "the great river", a site granted to St. Carthach by the prince of the Desii of Waterford. Lismore was founded in 635; and the founder survived only two years, for he died in 637, but Providence blessed his work, and his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> grew to be the greatest centre of learning and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> in all the South of Erin. The "Rule of St. Carthach" is the most notable literary monument which the founder left behind him. It is fortunately still extant in the ancient Gaelic verse in which it was written. It consists of 185 four-lined stanzas, which have been translated by O'Curry &mdash; who has no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of its authenticity &mdash; and is beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> one of the most interesting and important documents of the early <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church.

<p>But Lismore produced a still more famous saint and scholar, the great St. Cathaldus of Tarentum. His <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> name was Cathal, and it appears he was born at a place called Rathan, not far from <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a>. Our <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> annals tell us nothing of St. Cathaldus, because he went abroad early in life, but the brothers Morini of his adopted home give us many particulars. They tell us he was a native of Hibernia &mdash; born at Rathan in Momonia &mdash; that he studied at <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a>, and became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of his native territory of Rathan, but that afterwards, inspired by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of missionary enterprise, he made his way to Jerusalem, and on his return was, with his companions, wrecked at <a href="../cathen/14450d.htm">Tarentum</a> &mdash; the "beautiful <a href="../cathen/14450d.htm">Tarentum</a>" &mdash; at the heel of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Its pleasure-loving inhabitants, forgetting the Gospel preached to them by St. Peter and St. Mark, had become practically <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> when Cathaldus and his companions were cast upon their shores. Seeing the city given up to vice and sensuality, the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> preached with great fervour, and wrought many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, so that the Tarentines gave up their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> ways, and from that day to this have recognized the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Cathaldus as their <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a>, and greatly venerate his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, which was found intact in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> as far back as the year 1110, with his name "Cathaldus Rachan" inscribed upon a cross therein. Another distinguished scholar of <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a>, and probably its second <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, was St. Cuanna, most likely the half-brother and successor of the founder. He was born at Kilcoonagh, or Killcooney, a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> near Headford in the County <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a> which takes its name from him. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> he went to Lismore on account of his close connexion with St. Carthach, and for the same reason was chosen to succeed him in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a>. <a href="../cathen/04099c.htm">Colgan</a> thought that the ancient but now lost "Book of Cuanach", cited in the "Annals of Ulster", but not later than A.D. 628, was the work of this St. Cuanna of Kilcooney and <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a>. It is also said that Aldfrid, King of Northumbria, spent some time at the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a>, for he visited most of the famous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Erin towards the close of the seventh century, and at that time Lismore was one of the most celebrated. It was a place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> also, and many <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> princes gave up the sceptre and returned to Lismore to end their lives in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and penance. There, too, by his own desire, was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> St. Celsus of Armagh, who died at Ardpatrick, but directed that he should be buried in Lismore &mdash; but we have sought in vain for any trace of his monument.

<p>Two interesting memorials of <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a> are fortunately still preserved. The first is the <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a> of <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a>, found accidentally in Lismore Castle in the year 1814. The inscription tells us that it was made for Niall Mac Mic Aeducan, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a>, 1090-1113, by Neclan the artist. This refers to the making of the case or shrine, which enclosed an old oak stick, the original <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a> of the founder. Most of the ornaments are richly gilt, interspersed with others of silver and niello, and bosses of coloured enamels. The second is the "Book of <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a>" found in the castle at the same time with the <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>, enclosed in a wooden box in a built-up doorway. The castle was built as long ago as 1185 by Prince John. Afterwards the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a> came to live there, and no doubt both <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a> and book belonged to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and were hidden for security in troublesome times. The Book of <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a> contains a very valuable series of the lives of our <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, written in the finest <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>. It was in 1890 admirably translated into English by Dr. Whitley Stokes.
