<h1>School of Mayo</h1>  

<p>(Irish <em>Magh Eo</em>, which means, according to Colgan, the Plain of the Oaks, and, according to O'Donovan, the Plain of the Yews).

<p>The Mayo was situated in the present <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Mayo, County Mayo, almost equidistant from the towns of Claremorris and Castlebar. The founder, St. Colman, who flourished about the middle of the seventh century, was in all probability a native of the West of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and made his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies at <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a> during the abbacy of the renowned Segenius. After the death of Finian, the second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a>, Colman was appointed to succeed him. His episcopate was much disturbed by a fierce renewal of the <a href="../cathen/05228a.htm">Easter Controversy</a>. Colman vigorously advocated the old <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> custom, and cited the example of his predecessors, but all to no effect. At a synod specially summoned to meet at Whitby in 664, the Roman method of calculation triumphed, and Colman, unwilling to abandon the practice of the "holy elders of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church", resolved to quit <a href="../cathen/09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a> forever.

<p>In 668 he crossed the seas to his native land again, and in a remote island on the western coast called Inishbofin, he built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. These things are clearly set out in the "Historia Ecclesiastica" of <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, who then proceeds to describe how they led to the founding of the great <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Mayo. "Colman, the Irish Bishop", says <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, "departed from Britain and took with him all the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> that he had assembled in the Island of Lindisfarne, and also about thirty of the English nation who had been instructed in the monastic life. . . .Afterwards he retired to a small island which is to the west of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and at some distance from the coast, called in the language of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, Inishbofinde [island of the white cow]. Arriving there he built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and placed in it the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> he brought with him of both nations".

<p>It appears, however, the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> could not agree. "Then Colman sought to put an end to their dissensions, and travelling about at length found a place in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> fit to build a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, which in the language of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> is called <em>Magh Eo</em> (Mayo)". Later on we are told by the same historian that this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> became an important and flourishing institution, and even an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>.

<p>Though Colman, we may assume, lived mainly with his own countrymen at Inishbofin, he took a deep and practical interest in his new foundation at Mayo--"Mayo of the Saxons", as it came to be called. In the year 670, with his consent, its first canonical <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was appointed. This was <a href="../cathen/06464b.htm">St. Gerald</a>, the son of a northern English king, who, annoyed at the way Colman's most cherished convictions had been slighted at Whitby, resolved to follow him to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> gained greatly in fame for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and learning under this youthful <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. About 679 <a href="../cathen/01135c.htm">St. Adamnan</a>, the illustrious biographer of St. Columba, visited Mayo and according to some writers, ruled there for seven years after Gerald's death. This latter statement is not, on the face of it, improbable if Gerald, as <a href="../cathen/04099c.htm">Colgan</a> thinks, did not live after 697; but the Four Masters give the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death as 13 March, 726, and the "Annals of Ulster" put the event as late as 731. After Gerald's death we have only the record of isolated facts concerning the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> he ruled so wisely and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> so well, but they are often facts of considerable interest and importance. We read, for example, that the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was burned in 783, and again in 805; also--but only in the old Life of <a href="../cathen/06464b.htm">St. Gerald</a>--that it was plundered by Turgesius the Dane in 818. That the monastic grounds were regarded as exceptionally holy we can gather from the entry that Domhnall, son of Torlough O'Conor, Lord of North Connacht, "the glory and the moderator and the good adviser of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> people" (d. 1176), was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> therein. That it had the status of an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> long after the Synod of Kells (1152), is clear from the entry under the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of 1209, recording the death of "Cele O'Duffy, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Magh Eo of the Saxons.".

<p>Mayo, like the other ancient <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, suffered from the raids of native and foreigner, especially during the fourteenth century. But it survived them all, for the death under date 1478 is recorded of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>--"Bishop Higgens of Mayo of the Saxons". The time at which the See of Mayo, on the ground that it contained not a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> but a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> church, was annexed to <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, cannot with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> be ascertained, but as far back as 1217, during the reign of <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>, the question was before the Roman authorities for discussion. It was probably not settled definitively for centuries after. James O'Healy, "<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mayo of the Saxons", was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> at Kilmallock in 1579.
