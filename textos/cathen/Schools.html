<h1>Schools</h1>  

<h2>In the Church</h2>
<h3>The Christian Church</h3>

<p>By virtue of her Divine charter, "Going, teach ye all nations", the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is essentially a teaching organization. Teaching is included in her task of saving <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Primarily she was instituted to dispense the means of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and to teach the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which are necessary to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. These <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> are spiritual and moral, and her catechumenal schools were instituted for the purpose of teaching them. Truths which are not of their nature spiritual, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, of history, matters of culture &mdash; in a word, profane learning &mdash; these do not belong intrinsically to the programme of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> teaching. Nevertheless, they enter into her work by force of circumstance, when, namely, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> youth cannot attain a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of them without incurring grave danger to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. They enter also into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> task by reason of a pedagogical principle which she has always recognized in practice. Religion being the supreme co-ordinating principle in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, as it is in life, if the so-called secular branches of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are taught without reference to religion, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> feels that an <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> mistake is being made, that the "one thing necessary" is being excluded, to the detriment of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> itself. Therefore she assumes the task of teaching the secular branches in such a way that religion is the centralizing, unifying, and vitalizing force in the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> process. Whenever there is positive and immediate danger of loss of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot allow her children to run the risk of perversion; whenever religion is left out of the curriculum, she tries to supply the defect. In both cases she establishes under her own control schools which are called <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and which, in the vicissitudes of historical development or from the particular circumstances of their foundation, scope, or maintenance, are specifically known as <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> schools, monastic schools, <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> schools, <a href="../cathen/03573c.htm">chantry</a> schools, guild schools, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> schools, etc.
<h3>Catechetical schools</h3>

<p>These flourished about the middle of the second century of the Christian era. They were brought into existence by the conflict of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> with <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> philosophy. They were, consequently, academies of higher learning. Out of them grew the first great schools of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> controversy and also the schools for the special training of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, although there were, almost from the beginning, schools attached to the household of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (episcopal schools) where <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> were trained, We have reason to believe that in some instances, as in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> school of Protogenes at <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> (about 180), not only the higher branches but also the elementary branches were taught in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> schools. Schools of this type became more numerous as time went on. In the Council of <a href="../cathen/16078b.htm">Vaison</a> (529) the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Gaul are commanded to take boys into their household and teach them to read "the <a href="../bible/psa000.htm">Psalms</a>, and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and to instruct them in the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Law of God</a>". From these sprang the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> schools of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> and modern times.

<p>As the conflict between <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> philosophy gave rise to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> schools, so the more general struggle between <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> standards of life gave rise to other provisions on the part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for safeguarding the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> children. In the first centuries great stress was laid on the importance of home <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and this task was committed in a special manner to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> mothers. It is sufficient to mention the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> matrons <a href="../cathen/09508b.htm">Macrina</a>, Emmelia, Nonna, Anthusa, <a href="../cathen/10482a.htm">Monica</a>, and Paula, mothers of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and scholars, to show how successfully the home under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> mother was made to counteract the influence of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> schools. There were also private schools for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> youth, taught by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, for instance the school at <a href="../cathen/07692a.htm">Imola</a>, taught by Cassian.
<h3>Monastic schools</h3>

<p>Monasticism as an institution was a protest against the corrupt <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> standards of living which had begun to influence not only the public life of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> but also their private and domestic life. Even in the fourth century, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> testifies to the decline of fervour in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and contends that it is no longer possible for children to obtain proper religious and moral training in their own homes. It was part of the purpose of monasticism to meet this need and to supply not only to the members of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders but also to children committed to the care of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> the moral religious, and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> culture which could not be obtained elsewhere without lowering the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> standard of life. At the same time episcopal schools, though instituted primarily for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> candidates, did not decline to admit secular scholars, especially after the State schools of the empire had fallen into decay. There were <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> schools also, which, while they aimed at fostering vocations to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, were expressly commanded not to deny their pupils the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to enter the married state as soon as they reached the age of maturity (<em>cum ad &oelig;tatem perfectam pervenerint</em>). The explicit enactment of the Council of <a href="../cathen/16078b.htm">Vaison</a> (529) in this matter is important because it refers to a similar custom already prevailing in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. It remains <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, however, that although the episcopal and presbyteral (parochial) schools thus contributed to the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, the chief portion of the burden of lay <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> was borne by the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. The earliest monastic legislation does not clearly define the organization of the "internal" and "external" schools. Nevertheless, it recognizes the existence in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of children who were to be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>, not for the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, but for the world. In <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, as Archbishop Healy says, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, "taught the children of the rich and poor alike" ("Ireland's Ancient Schools and Scholars", 102), and to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> went not only <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> but <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and the Continent, to receive an <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. On the Continent also the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, "gentle and simple", fell to the lot of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. It is difficult to say when the distinction between the "internal" school (<em>schola claustri</em>) and the "external" (<em>schola canonica, s. externa</em>) was first introduced. We find it in St. Gall, <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> and <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> in the ninth and tenth centuries. In the internal school the pupils were <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, future members of the order, some of whom were offered up (<em>oblati</em>) by their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> at a tender age. In the external school were the children of the neighbouring villagers and the sons of the nobility; many of the references to this class of pupils in the monastic code lay stress on the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to treat all with equal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, not taking account of their rank in life. There was a similar custom in regard to the reception of young girls in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, as appears from several enactments of Bishop St. C&aelig;sarius of Arles and his successors. At Arles, moreover, according to Muteau (see bibliography) open schools (<em>&eacute;coles ouvertes</em>) were held by the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> for the benefit of the entire neighbourhood. The curriculum of studies in the monastic schools comprised the <em>trivium</em> and <em>quadrivium,</em> that is to say, grammar, rhetoric, dialectic, arithmetic, geometry, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, and the theory of music. Besides, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> cultivated the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and art of healing; they devoted attention to agriculture, building, and the decorative arts. They took pains to transcribe the Classics as well as the distinctly <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> works that had come down to them; and in doing this they developed the art of penmanship and that of illumination to a high degree of perfection. They were <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalists</a> also, noting down year by year the important events not only in the life of their own community but also in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at large and in the political world. Finally, by example and precept they dignified manual labour, which in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was despised as fit only for slaves.



<p>The head of the monastic school was called <em>magister schol&oelig;, capiscola, proscholus,</em> etc. By the end of the ninth century, however, the usual name for the head of the school was <em>scholasticus.</em> His assistants were called <em>seniores.</em> The method of teaching was influenced largely by the scarcity of books and the need of handing down without diminution the heritage of the past. The master dictated (<em>legere</em> was the word used to signify the act of teaching), and the pupils wrote not only the text but also the master's explanation or commentary. Of the many textbooks in use the most popular was the work by Marcianus Capella (about 420) entitled "Satyricon, seu de Nuptiis Mercurii et Philologi&aelig;". That the instruction given to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> in the monastic schools was entirely gratuitous is evident from the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of Bishop Theodulf of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> in the eighth century, and from other documents. When, at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, the external school was frequented by a number of wealthy pupils, whose <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> gifts to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> put the poorer students in a position of apparent inferiority, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that see, Amalric, gave a generous donation to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to be used in the maintenance of poor students. The <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> revival of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> affected not only the internal schools of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> but also the external schools, and, during the reign of Charles's successors <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> by a number of decrees showed their interest in the maintenance not only of schools of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred science</a>, but also in schools "for the study of letters". The external school had by this time become a recognized institution, which the sons of the farmers in the neighbourhood of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> frequented not by privilege but by a right freely acknowledged. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that before the end of the ninth century both boys and girls attended the schools attached to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches in the <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Diocese of Soissons</a>. As time went on the establishment and maintenance of schools by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was made a matter of express canonical enactment. No document could be more explicit than the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Third Council of Lateran (1179): "That every <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> have a teacher (<em>magistrum</em>) who is to teach poor scholars and others, and that no one receive a fee for permission to teach" (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XXII, 234).
<h3>Cathedral schools</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> schools sprang from the episcopal schools which, as has been said, existed from a very early time for the training of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. Chrodegang, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, 742-66, is said to be the founder of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> schools, but only in the sense that he organized the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> into a community, and ordained that they undertake the conduct and management of the school attached to their church. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself was to have control of the school and under him was to be the immediate superior of the school (<em>magister schol&oelig;</em>). In the cities and towns where there was no <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the canons of the local church were organized after the manner of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and conducted a "canonicate" school. In both institutions there came to be distinguished; <ul><li>(1) the elementary school (<em>schola minor</em>) where reading, writing, psalmody, etc. were taught; and <li>(2) the higher school (<em>schola major</em>) in which the curriculum consisted either of the <em>trivium</em> alone (grammar, rhetoric and dialectic), or of the full programme, namely the seven liberal arts, Scripture, and what we now call pastoral theology.</ul>

<p>The method employed in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> schools was identical with that of the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> schools.
<h3>Chantry schools</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03573c.htm">chantry</a> schools were similar in character to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and canonicate schools. Indeed, they may be said to be a specific kind of canonicate schools. The <a href="../cathen/03573c.htm">chantry</a> was a foundation with endowment, the proceeds of which went to one or more <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> carrying the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of singing or saying <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> at stated times, or daily, for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the endower, or for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> named by him. It was part of the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the incumbents of a <a href="../cathen/03573c.htm">chantry</a> foundation to "teach gratis the poor who asked it humbly for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". (See "Catholic University Bulletin," IX, 3 sq.).
<h3>Guild schools, hospital schools, and city schools</h3>

<p>The last beginning with the thirteenth century, shared the work of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> with the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03573c.htm">chantry</a> schools. The guilds and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> were <a href="../cathen/06157b.htm">ecclesiastical foundations</a>, were guided by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and engaged in the work of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The city schools at first met with opposition from the teachers in the monastic and <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> foundations, although they also were under the control of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. <a href="../cathen/08613b.htm">Kehrein</a> in his "History of Education" (see bibliography) mentions a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> which prohibits any <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> from preventing any <em>magister</em> or <em>scholasticus</em> from taking charge of a school in the city or suburb "since <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift of God</a> and talent is free". Towards the end of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the task of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> teacher became so important that communities of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> were founded for the express purpose of devoting their lives to the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of elementary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The best known of these communities is that of <a href="../cathen/04166b.htm">"The Brothers of the Common Life"</a> founded by <a href="../cathen/07036a.htm">Gerard Groot</a> (1340-84) at Deventer. It soon extended to Windedheim, Agnetenberg, and other towns in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and North <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. To this community belonged <a href="../cathen/14661a.htm">Thomas &agrave; Kempis</a>, the author of "The Imitation of Christ". That these various provisions for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> not only of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> but also of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>--monastic schools, <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> schools, canonicate schools, <a href="../cathen/03573c.htm">chantry</a> schools, guild schools, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> schools, city schools, and special educational institutions--met the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> needs of the times, and were adequate as far as the circumstances of the times would allow, is the verdict of all historians who view without prejudice the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> career of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Allain (see bibliography) has told the story of primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; Ravelet (see bibliography) has gone over the whole question of primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a>; Leach has told part of the story (see bibliography) as far as pre-Reformation <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> is concerned. It is impossible to give more than a summary statement of the facts which these writers have accumulated. Those facts, however, justify the assertion that, far from opposing or neglecting the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the masses, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a> provided generously for their instruction in the elementary branches, as well as in the department of higher studies, whenever and wherever the political, social, and <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> conditions were not so adverse as to thwart her <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> efforts.

<p>Both the particular and the <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, imperial capitularies, and episcopal and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> decrees show that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, while concerned primarily for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of future members of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> body in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred sciences</a>, were also at pains to encourage and promote the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. For instance, the Council of Cloveshoe, held by Cuthbert, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> in 749, prescribes that abbesses as well as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> provide for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of all their households (<em>famili&oelig;</em>). A <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> capitulary of 802 enjoins "that everyone should send his son to study letters, and that the child should remain at school with all diligence until he became well instructed in learning". Theodulf of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> in 797 decrees that gratuitous instruction be given by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in every town and village of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and there cannot be the least <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> is meant. The Council of Ch&acirc;lon-sur-Sa&ocirc;ne in 813 legislates in a similar spirit that not only "schools of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a>" but also "schools of letters" be established. The Council of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, held in 853, directs the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Universal Church to establish "in every episcopal residence [<em>in universis episcopiis</em>] among the populations subject to them, and in all places where there is such need" masters and teachers to teach "literary studies and the seven liberal arts". These and similar documents lay stress on the obligatian which rests on the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and godparents to see to the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of children committed to their care. By the middle of the ninth century the distinction between external and internal monastic schools being clearly recognized, and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> schools having become a regular <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> institution, the testimonies in favour of popular <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> under the auspices of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> become clearer. In the tenth century, in spite of the disturbed conditions in the political world, learning flourished in the great <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, such as that of St. Gall (Switzerland). St. Maximin (Trier), and in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> schools, such as those of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> and <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. The greatest teachers of that time, Bruno of Cologne and Gerbert of Aurillac (Pope Sylvester II), taught not only the sacred but also the profane <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. In the eleventh century the school of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, that of Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and the numerous schools of rhetoric and dialectic show that even in the higher branches of learning, in spite of the fact that the teachers were invariably <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> were welcomed and were not denied <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the secondary kind. That, as historians have pointed out, the references to popular and elementary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the local councils of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> have not always been preserved, is explained by the fact that elementary Church schools were now an established fact. Ecclesiastical authority intervened only whenever some abuse called for remedial legislation. Thus, the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Third Council of Lateran already referred to (n. III) aimed at abolishing the custom of exacting fees for instruction in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> schools. There were, naturally, details of arrangement to be determined, such as salary of teachers and supervision or personal instruction on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. These were provided in decrees, such as that of the Diocesan Synod of <a href="../cathen/11251a.htm">St. Omer</a> in 1183 and that of Engelbert II, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, in 1270.

<p>The history of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> is the story of the efforts made in monastic, <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, <a href="../cathen/03573c.htm">chantry</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> schools for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> as well as of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In the narrative of the suppression and confiscation of these foundations Leach (see bibliography) gives abundant documentary evidence to justify his assertion that "Grammar schools, instead of being comparatively modern, post-Reformation inventions, are among our most ancient institutions, some of them far older than the Lord Mayor of London or the House of Commons" (p. 5). He estimates the number of grammar schools before the reign of Edward VI to have been "close on two hundred", and these he considers to be merely "the survivors of a much larger host which have been lost in the storms of the past, and drowned in the seas of destruction" (ibid.). There were, he maintains, not only schools connected with the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral churches</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, collegiate churches, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, guilds, and chantries, but also independent schools, in one of which "an old man was paid thirteen shillings and fourpence by the Mayor, to teach young children their A B C" (p. 7). Lincoln, <a href="../cathen/03657a.htm">Chichester</a>, and Wells were the principal <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> schools. Beverley, <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>, Crediton, Ripon, <a href="../cathen/15648a.htm">Wimborne</a>, Warwick, Stafford, and Tamworth had important collegiate schools. At <a href="../cathen/05648a.htm">Evesham</a>, Cirencester, and Lewes were the principal <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> schools at the eve of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, while at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, Cambridge, Eton, and elsewhere were thirty-one college schools of grammar before the reign of Edward VI, The number of schools in proportion to the population of the country was relatively very great, and as far as it is possible for us now to judge the attendance, that, too, must have been relatively large. The history of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> before the reformation is told in the first part of Grant's "History of the Burgh Schools of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>". "Our earliest records", says that writer, "prove not only that schools existed, but that they were then invariably found in connection with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>" (p. 2). He quotes documents for the foundation of schools in 1100, 1120, 1180, 1195, and cites in many instances <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> approval and confirmation of educational establishments in the twelfth century. He is convinced that these institutions were intended not merely for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> but also for young <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> (ibid., p. 12), and he concludes his summary by admitting that "The scattered jottings collected in this chapter show our <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to the ancient Church for having so diligently promoted our national <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>--an <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> placed within the reach of <em>all</em> classes" (ibid., p. 72).

<p>The educational institutions founded and supported by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and other parts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> have, in part, been mentioned in the general account of monastic and <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> schools. Specht (see bibliography) has produced documentary evidence to show the extent to which laywomen were <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> schools of the ninth and the following centuries; he has also shown that daughters of noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> were, as a rule, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by private teachers who, for the most part, were <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a>. The assertion so frequently made that, during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, learning was considered out of place in a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, that even elementary <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of letters was a prerogative of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, is not sustained by a careful examination of historical records. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that there are passages in the popular literature of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> in which the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, who is well versed in the art of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> and in the usages of polite <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, affects to despise learning and to regard it as a monkish or <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> accomplishment. But, as L&eacute;on Maitre (see bibliography) asserts, "such <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> was by no means systematic; it arose from the conditions of the times". "Knowledge", says a twelfth-century writer, "is not an exclusive privilege of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, for many <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> are instructed in literature. A prince, whenever he can succeed in escaping from the tumult of public affairs and from [the confusion of] constant <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a>, ought to devote himself to the study of books" (P.L., CCIII, col. 149). The number of distinguished <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> and laywomen, emperors, kings, nobles, queens and princesses who, during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval era</a>, attained prominence as scholars shows that the advice was not disregarded. The <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> recently reaffirmed that "the Church was not the mother, but rather the stepmother, of learning" is easily asserted, but is not so easily <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>.

<p>The destruction of this vast and varied system of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation is a fact of general history. The schools, as a rule, disappeared with the institutions to which they were attached. The confiscation of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> on which the chantries were founded, the removal of the guilds from the control of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, the suppression of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and canonical chapters and the sequestration of their possessions by the State, were the immediate cause of the cessation of this kind of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> activity on the part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at the time of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> and afterwards. In <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> countries these events took place in the course of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, a compromise was reached in some States by the recognition of both <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> "confessional" schools and the division of school funds, an arrangement which lasted until the beginning of the nineteenth century; in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the work of confiscation began with the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>; in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> the suppression and spoliation have taken place within the last half-century and are still going on. Apart from the question of elementary <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>--the question of violation of a strict right to their own lands and funds, which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> corporations possessed at the time their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was seized and their schools suppressed--there arises now the question of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to teach, the right of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to found and maintain private schools, and the alleged exclusive right of the State to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educate</a>.
<h3>The fundamental principles of canon law</h3>

<p>Those principles bearing on these questions may be stated as follows: <ul><li>(1) The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, being a perfect <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to establish schools, which, although they may be permitted by the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> merely as private institutions, are, of their nature, public; <li>(2) By <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> lies primarily with the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of a child to provide for his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, as well as for his physical support. This is part of the purpose and aim of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> as an institution. If no provision is made by any other institution, the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> must provide <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> either by their own effort or that of others whom they employ; <li>(3) When the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> neglect their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> in the matter of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, the State, in the interests of public welfare, takes up the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of teaching. It has, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to establish schools, and, consequently, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to compel attendance, in so far as the principle holds good that public welfare demands a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, at least, of the elementary branches of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>.</ul>

<p>From the interaction and conflict of these fundamental <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> arise the following more particular principles: <ul><li>(1) The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has the exclusive right to teach religion to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children. Neither the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> nor the State can exercise this right except they do so with the consent (as <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> do) and under the supervision and control of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>. <li>(2) The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot approve schools which exclude religion from the curriculum, both because religion is the most important subject in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and because she contends that even secular <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> is not possible in its best form unless religion be made the central, vitalizing, and co-ordinating factor in the life of the child. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, sometimes, tolerates schools in which religion is not taught, and permits <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children to attend them, when the circumstances are such as to leave no alternative, and when due precautions are taken to supply by other means the religious training which such schools do not give. She reserves the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to judge whether this be the case, and, if her judgment is unfavourable, claims the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to forbid attendance (see Letter of <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Bishops, 16 Jan., 1831). <li>(3) In all schools, whether established by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or the State, or even by a group of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> (so long as there are pupils received from different <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>) the State has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to see that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of public health, public order, and public morality are observed, and if in any school doctrines were taught subversive of public peace or otherwise opposed to the interests of the general public, the State would have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to intervene "in the name of the good of the general public". <li>(4) State monopoly of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> has been considered by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to be nothing short of a tyrannical usurpation. In principle it overrides the fundamental right of the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, denies the right of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> even to open and maintain schools for the teaching of religion alone, and in its natural effect on public opinion tends to place religion below considerations of mere worldly welfare. <li>(5) The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not deny the right of the State to levy taxes for the support of the State schools, although, as we shall see, this leads to <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> in the manner of its application in some countries. The principle is distinct always from the abuse of the principle. Similarly, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not deny the right of the State to <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> compulsory <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> so long as such decrees do not abrogate other and more fundamental <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. It should always be remembered, however, that compulsion on the part of the State is not the exercise of a primary and predominant right, but must be justified by considerations of public good. <li>(6) Finally, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the matter of religious teaching extend not only to the subject of religion itself but to such matters as the character of the teacher, the spirit and tone of the teaching in such subjects as history and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, and the contents of the textbooks used. She recognizes that de-Christianized teaching and de-Christianized textbooks have inevitably the effect of lessening in the minds of pupils the esteem which she teaches them to have for religion. In a word her <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> are bounded, not by the subject of religion, but by the spiritual interests of the children committed to her care.</ul>
<h3>The present status of the Church and state in regard to education</h3>

<h4>In Germany</h4>

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the primary schools in <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> provinces passed over to the control of the local <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>. In <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communities the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> did not yield so readily to the aggression of the State. All through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries councils (Cologne, 1536 and 1560; Salzburg, 1569; Breslau, 1592; Augsburg, 1610) withstood the encroachments of <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> on the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> schools and, as a rule, a <em>modus vivendi</em> was reached satisfactory to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. By the end of the eighteenth century however, the notion of State <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> matters was firmly established. For the most part the foundation of private schools was the solution. These were recognized by German law as belonging to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Early in the nineteenth century the so-called "simultaneous schools" began to be the ordinary solution of the problem. In these there were children of various <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>, each denomination having, in theory, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to care for the religious instruction of its members. On several occasions the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> or of some German state protested (e.g. at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, 1848; the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 1850) against the restrictions of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. At the present time the simultaneous schools are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> in a few provinces and optional (<em>facultativ</em>) in others, while in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, the Rhine Provinces and elsewhere, "confessional", i.e. denominational, schools are the rule, and simultaneous, or mixed, schools, the exception. Throughout the empire the supreme control of all elementary schools is vested in the government, the local <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> being granted a greater or less amount of supervision and control according to the different circumstances in different localities. The teacher of religion for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> is of course always a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, almost always a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and is a regularly qualified and salaried teacher, like the instructor in other branches. The attitude of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> towards the contemporary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> system in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> is set forth in the decrees of the Council of Cologne (1860).

<h4>In Austria</h4>

<p>Until the beginning of the nineteenth century the conditions were similar to those existing in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The legislation of <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> had been distinctly hostile to religious influence in the schools. However, the enactments of 1808, 1868, 1885, etc. give a measure of authority and control to the local <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> which make the conditions in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> to be as a rule more favourable than in the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. The question of language has of course complicated matters in many provinces of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and local conditions, the <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> of the government official, etc. have much to do with the actual status of religious teaching in the public schools. The decrees of the Council of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1858) contain the views of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> in regard to the present condition of religious <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in that country. The Letter of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">Papal Nuncio</a> (22 Oct., 1868) is also an important declaration. See also articles 5-8 of the Concordat of 1855 (<a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN MONARCHY</a>).

<h4>In France</h4>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleonic</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 1808 established in principle and in fact the most rigorous State monopoly in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. It met at once with a vigorous protest on the part of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who demanded freedom of instruction in the name of the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> in whom, they contended, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educate</a> is primarily vested. In 1833 and 1850 (<em>La loi Falloux</em>) "free schools" were recognized. No special concession was made to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> but permission was granted to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> to open schools. From 1833 to 1850 members of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> could teach only in the State schools. After 1850 they were free, as citizens, to open schools of their own, both primary and secondary. In 1886 a blow was struck at free primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> by authorization given to mayors and school inspectors to oppose the opening of any private school on hygienic or moral grounds. In 1888 came another attack in the form of an order of the Council of State, depriving communes and departments of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to grant appropriations for private schools. Finally in 1904 it was declared that "teaching of every grade and every kind" is forbidden in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to the members of the congregations. This resulted in the closing of 14,404 out of 16,904 "Congregational" schools. Since that time the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have tried to reorganize <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> by establishing private schools in which the teachers are either <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> and laywomen or secularized members of the congregations. Instruction in religion in the State schools was optional with the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of the children by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 1881. In 1882 religious instruction in the primary schools of the State was absolutely forbidden, and in 1886 religious and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> were forbidden to teach in those schools. In place of denominational religion there was introduced first a species of "denominational neutrality" and later, a "scientific religion" (<em>enseignement critique</em>). Within the present decade the tendency of this teaching has been plainly seen in the introduction of textbooks which are both anti-clerical and anti-religious, with the result that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are at present under indictment in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> for daring to warn the people of their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> against the use of such books in the schools supported by the people.

<h4>In Belgium</h4>

<p>See <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">BELGIUM</a>; also pamphlet by Cardinal Dechamps, "Le Nouveau projet de loi sur l'enseignement primaire" (Mechlin, 1879).

<h4>In England</h4>

<p>Until the beginning of the nineteenth century there was no government system of primary schools in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, nor were any primary schools in receipt of State aid. It was not until 1833 that government grants were made, and then the schools that benefited by the grants were either schools of the National and British Foreign Society, or, in any case, schools in which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> was to be read as part of the regular instruction. The civil disabilities under which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> suffered, and the restriction of grants in practice to Bible-reading schools excluded <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> private schools from State aid until 1848. In 1856 and 1858 the conditions under which grants were given were made more favourable to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. From 1871 to 1903 the basic law of primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was Forster's Elementary Education Act of 1870. This Act, while it did not abolish the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> or denominational schools, established the Board-schools. These were to be supported from the rates or taxes, and governed by school boards elected by the people. The Government helped to build the school and, in places where the boards were judged culpably negligent, compelled them to build. In 1876 and 1880 supplementary enactments were passed, called School Attendance Acts, which compel the attendance at either <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> or Board-schools of all children under ten. The religious difficulty was met at first by leaving the matter of religious instruction to the discretion of the local board. Later the "Conscience" clause and the "Cowper-Temple" clause were added, in order to satisfy the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11095b.htm">Nonconformists</a>. These clauses set aside a special hour for religious instruction, attendance at which was to be entirely <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, and forbade the use of "any <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> or religious formulary distinctive of any particular denomination". <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were able to accept these conditions in some localities. Meantime various enactments, for example in 1891 and 1897, were passed, which lessened the burden of the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> schools. The Bill of 1902, which became law in 1903, took the power out of the hands of the school boards, vested it in the town and county councils, and compelled these to take over and maintain the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> schools. This brought <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in line with <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, where a similar law was in force since 1872. The <a href="../cathen/11095b.htm">Nonconformists</a>, however, objected because in localities where they were in the minority the religious instruction given in the schools would be denominational, that is <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a>. To meet this objection Mr. Birrell's Bill of 1906 was framed. But, after various vicissitudes, the Bill was finally defeated, and never became law. It would have had the effect of wiping the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> schools out of existence and abolishing all denominational instruction, a result which, apparently, would be acceptable to the <a href="../cathen/11095b.htm">Nonconformists</a>, but is bitterly opposed by both <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a>. In 1870 the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> was 354, providing for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of 101,933 children; while in 1906 the number of schools had increased to 1062 and the attendance had reached 284,746. This increase is largely due to the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> School Committee, now known as the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Education Council.

<h4>In Ireland</h4>

<p>The primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> is provided for by; <ul><li>(1) Schools under the management of the <a href="../cathen/03710b.htm">Irish Christian Brothers</a> and other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, which receive no part of the annual grant for primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and are free from government supervision and inspection. In 1901 there were 97 of these schools. <li>(2) Private schools, which are also free, and do not share the annual grant. In 1901 there were 85 of these, but the report does not state how many of these are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. <li>(3) National Schools, endowed by the State, of which in 1901 there were 8569, with an attendance of 602,209. These were established by the Act of 1831 and are governed by that Act and subsequent <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, authority being vested in the National Commissioners of Education.</ul>

<p>The majority of the National Schools are taught by lay teachers. Many of the girls' schools are, however, taught by <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and boys' schools by <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> (of the Congregation of St. John Baptist de La Salle), Presentation, <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marist</a>, Patrician, and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Brothers, The Act of 1831 aimed at separate instruction in religion. In places where it is at all practicable there is a National School for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and one for <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> in the same locality. Where the attendance is "mixed" there is a separate hour for religious instruction, attendance at which is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. In <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sections, or when the majority of children are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, the manager is almost invariably the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. The manager is the local school authority: he appoints the teachers (subject to the approval of the commissioners), removes them, and conducts all the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> correspondence with the commissioners. His powers and his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> are those of a school board. He is, if a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, responsible to his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. By enactment of the Maynooth Synod of 1900 he may not dismiss a teacher without submitting the case to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in which the school is situated. Of the seven training colleges for primary teachers, five are under the management of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The number of teachers trained in these colleges is now more than double the number of untrained teachers. Religious instruction in the primary schools is given at a stated hour by the regular teachers of the school: this is supplemented by the local <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, who have access, within reasonable limits, to the classroom for the purpose of religious instruction. That these conditions are, on the whole, acceptable to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is clear from the pastoral address issued in 1900 from the <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">National Synod</a> of Maynooth. It should be added, however, that it is due to the vigilance and devotedness of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> that they have gradually evolved from the original National system which was "thoroughly dangerous", a system which at the present time is "a help rather than a hindrance to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>".

<h4>In the United States</h4>

<p>"The greatest religious fact in the United States today", writes Archbishop Spalding, "is the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> School system, maintained without any aid by the people who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it". The vastness of the system may be gauged by the fact that it comprises over 20,000 teachers, over 1,000,000 pupils, represents $100,000,000 worth of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>; and costs over $15,000,000 annually. This system grew up from <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> beginnings. Its growth has kept pace with the growth of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The oldest schools in the present territory of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> are the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools founded about 1600 in the Spanish colonies. The French colonies, too, had their schools as a regular part of the civil and religious scheme of colonization and civilization. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work in the Thirteen Colonies dates from the arrival of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colony in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. The first regularly established school in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> dates from 1640. As the condition changed from that of a missionary country to that of a country regularly provided with a fixed <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization, the schools came to be recognized as a function of organized <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> work. In the Spanish and French colonies the school, like the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, looked to the State for support. In the English colonies there was also State support of denominational <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, but whether the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> could or could not secure a share of the public funds depended on local conditions. When the States adopted their constitutions, they did not introduce any change in this respect. It was "the gradual rise of dissentient religious bodies in the colonies and States due to the influx of emigrants and other causes, that brought about important changes which led to the establishment of a 'non-sectarian' system of schools" (Burns, "The Catholic School System in the United States", p. 359). We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in many instances <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the West and even in <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> and New York obtained funds from the State for the support of their schools, as the <a href="../cathen/12493a.htm">Episcopalians</a> and <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterians</a> did for theirs.

<p>The unsuccessful attempt of Father Richard of <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a> in 1808 to obtain for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools of that city a share of the public funds, was followed in 1830 by a more successful plan at Lowell, Mass. At that time the population of Lowell included many <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> immigrants. In 1830 at the annual town meeting a committee was appointed to consider the expediency of "establishing a separate school for the benefit of the Irish population", and the following year the sum of fifty dollars annually was appropriate for that purpose. In 1855 there were two <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools at Lowell; both were recognized as part of the school system of the town, and both were supported out of the public funds. After sixteen years of successful trial the arrangement was discontinued in 1852, owing to the wave of bigotry known as the <a href="../cathen/08677a.htm">Knownothing</a> Movement that swept over New England. In New York, as early as 1806, St. Peter's School applied for and received State aid. A similar arrangement was made for St. Patrick's School in 1816. In 1824 this support was withdrawn by the State, owing to the activity of the Public School Society. To this <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was committed the entire school fund for distribution, and, as we learn from the protests of New York <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, the activity of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was directed towards making the public schools not strictly non-sectarian but offensively <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. In 1840 the School Controversy in New York was precipitated by the petition of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to be allowed a share of the public funds for their schools. The petition was rejected by the Common Council; but the fight was not, on that account, discontinued. With remarkable <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, eloquence, and erudition, Bishop Hughes, supported not only by all his <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> people, but also by some of the non-Catholic congregations of the city, urged the claims of religious <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. He laid stress on the contention that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to "a fair and just proportion of the funds appropriated for the common schools, provided the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> will do with it the same thing that is done in the common schools". He claimed no special privilege, but contended for the "constitutional <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>" of his people. He was opposed, not only by the Public School Society, but also by representatives of the <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodist</a>, Episcopal, and <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> Churches. The claims of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> went before the legislature; but there also sectarian <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> was injected into the discussion and bigotry gained the day. The controversy, however, had one good result. It showed the imminent danger to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> existing in the public school system as influenced by the so-called non-sectarians of that day, and as a consequence <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> set to work to build up, at a tremendous cost, a system of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> schools unsupported by the State.

<p>In theory it is still maintained that <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is being done to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. If the "secular branches" are taught in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> schools to the satisfaction of the State authorities, the schools should be compensated for doing that portion of the task which the State has assumed. On the other hand, there are many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who are convinced that if State aid were accepted it could be done only at the cost of independence, that State aid would be the price of admitting State supervision to the extent of partial de-Catholicization. There have, nevertheless, been individual instances in which a compromise has been reached, e.g. Savannah, Georgia; St. Augustine, Florida; Poughkeepsie, New York; and Faribault and Stillwater, Minnesota. The last-mentioned instance gave rise to the celebrated School Controversy of 1891-92. The Faribault plan consisted in setting aside a certain time for religious instruction, to be given gratis by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers, and a time for secular instruction, to be given also by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers. The secular instruction was to be paid for by the State, and in respect to that portion of its work the school was to be under State supervision; it was, in fact, to be recognized as a "public school". The question was finally carried to the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of the Propaganda</a>, which rendered its decision on 21 April, 1892, to the effect that "considering the peculiar circumstances and character of the arrangement, and the agreement by which the plan was inaugurated, it may be tolerated". In the discussion of the Faribault plan certain fundamental questions were touched, as for instance in <a href="../cathen/02715b.htm">Dr. Bouquillon's</a> "Education, to whom does it belong?" (Baltimore, 1891), "A Rejoinder to the Civilt&agrave; Cattolica" (Baltimore, 1892)," A Rejoinder to Critics" (Baltimore, 1892), Hollaind, S.J., "The Parents First" (New York, 1891), Conway, S.J., "The State Last" (New York, 1892), Brandi, S.J., in "Civilt&agrave; Cattolica", 2 Jan., 1892, tr. as a pamphlet (New York, 1892). It should be added that, owing to some local difficulty the agreement at Faribault and Stillwater was later discontinued, but a similar agreement is in force today in not a few places in Minnesota.

<p>The attitude of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> towards the problem of elementary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> has been consistent from the beginning. At first Bishop Carroll, in the days immediately following the Revolution, entertained the hope that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> might unite with their non-Catholic fellow-citizens in building up a system of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> that would be mutually satisfactory from the religious point of view. Soon, however, he realized that that hope was futile. After the First <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Synod he addressed (1792) a pastoral letter to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the country, in which he emphasized the necessity of a "pious and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> education of the young to insure their growing up in the faith", and expressed the hope that the graduates of the newly-founded College of Georgetown would, on returning to their homes, be able "to instruct and guide others in local schools". Thus the plan of organizing separate <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools was inaugurated. The First <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (1829) declares: "We judge it absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that schools should be established, in which the young may be taught the principles of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and morality, while being instructed in letters" ("Decreta", n. 33). The Second Council (1832) renewed this enactment and entered into the details of organization (see "Decreta", n. 38). The Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (1884) devoted very careful consideration to the subject of elementary schools and decreed in explicit terms the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of establishing a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> school in every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> within two years of the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, except where the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, on account of serious difficulties in the way (<em>ob graviores difficultates</em>) judges that a delay may be granted ("Acta et Decreta", 199, no. 1).
<h3>Parochial schools and public schools</h3>

<p>The establishment and maintenance of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> schools does not imply the condemnation of public schools, or opposition of any kind to the purpose for which these are established. At a meeting of the National Educational Association at <a href="../cathen/10704c.htm">Nashville</a>, <a href="../cathen/14508a.htm">Tennessee</a> in July, 1889, both Cardinal Gibbons, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and Archbishop Keane, then <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03455a.htm">Catholic University of America</a>, stated the case in favour of denominational schools, and made it clear that, so far as citizenship and patriotism are concerned, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools are aiming successfully at the same ideals as the public schools. Since that time the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> has been repeated that <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> schools lead to sectionalism, and are opposed to national patriotism. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> can only answer that this is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and point to facts to justify their reply. Our schools teach everything that is taught in the public schools, and, in addition, teach religion and religious morality. The exclusion of religion from the public schools is, we think, historically, the result of sectarian division and sectarian prejudice. In recent times theorists have sought to justify the omission on pedagogical grounds, and have suggested various substitutes for religion as a basis of morality. We criticize the theories, and point to the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> results in justification of our contention. If the exclusion of religion and the substitution for it of inadequate and futile moral <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> lead to disastrous results, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who call attention to those conditions, far from opposing the public school system, are really doing it a service. Meantime they feel that the tendency in the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> policy of the public school system is more and more towards secularization. In the matter of morality they feel that experiments more and more dangerous are being tried in the public schools, and if they protest, they are doing what, after all, they have a right, as taxpayers, to do. Meantime also they are developing their own system of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> without giving up the contention that, in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, they have a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to compensation for the secular <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in citizenship which they give in their schools.

<p>Conflicts between the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> authority of the State and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> have arisen in a few instances. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> have always recognized the right of officials of the Department of Health, etc., to interfere in the matters in which they have competence. Where they have retained full autonomy, and have not yielded for the sake of affiliation or some other form of recognition, they have naturally avoided all friction with State <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> authority. By way of exception, we have the celebrated Ohio Compulsory Education case, in which Father Patrick F. Quigley, of <a href="../cathen/14759a.htm">Toledo, Ohio</a>, resisted unsuccessfully the enactment of the <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">State of Ohio</a> (1890) compelling all principals and teachers in all schools to make quarterly reports to State officers. The still more famous <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a> Bible Case involved the question of the right of the District Board of Edgerton, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, to have the <a href="../cathen/02141a.htm">King James Version</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> read in the public schools which were attended by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> pupils. The Supreme Court of <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a> decided in favour of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.
<h3>Principles embodied in the parochial schools</h3>

<p>The sacrifice which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are making in maintaining their system of primary schools is justified, in their estimation, by the following principles: <ul><li>(1) The spiritual interests of the child, while not exclusive of others, such as learning, health, skill, ability to make a living, etc., are supreme. Where there is danger of wrecking the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> child no consideration of economy has weight. <li>(2) Next to religion, morality is the most important matter in the life of a child. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> maintain that morality is best taught when based on religion. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> theorists, especially, are convinced that the immature mind of the child cannot grasp principles of morality except they be presented by way of religious authority and religious feeling. <li>(3) Considering the nature of the child-mind, the whole curriculum of the school is best presented when it is organized and unified, not fragmented and disconnected. Religion, appealing as it does to the heart as well as to the head, offers the best principle of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> and spiritual unification and organization. The exclusion of religion from the schools is a pedagogical mistake. <li>(4) Although condemned by secularizing educationalists and sectarian enthusiasts as un-American and opposed to our national institutions, our schools seem to us to be second to none in national usefulness and effectiveness. They teach patriotism, and the results show that they teach it successfully. They teach morality, and the lives of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> people of the country show the result. They teach religion, thus constituting, in an age that questions everything, a great institutional force on the side of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in religious <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, and in definite moral responsibility.</ul>

<p>Besides, they strive, with great personal sacrifice on the part of people, teachers, and pupils, to keep up with the public school system in teaching the secular branches. They are as a rule the equals, and often the superiors, of the public schools in the quality of the secular instruction which they give. They have the advantage of discipline, uniformity of ideals, harmony of methods, and, above all, of disinterested devotedness on the part of their teachers. Finally, the fact should not be overlooked that the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> schools save many millions of dollars annually to the non-Catholic public, who, if the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children were not provided for in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> schools, would be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to increase very considerably the annual cost of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>.
<h3>Organization and statistics</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> school system is <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> in its organization. The supreme <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> authority is the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who governs and administers the schools of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> through the assistance of a school board and, very often, a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> (clerical) inspector of schools. The immediate authority is vested in the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, whose task it is to provide building, salaries, etc. The teachers are almost universally religious. The principal of the school is appointed usually by the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community to which he or she belongs. The great majority of the schools are mixed, that is, schools for boys and girls. The only exceptions, apparently, are those in which the boys are taught by brothers and the girls by sisters. There is no recognized national central authority in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> matters. However, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> school section of the <a href="../cathen/05305a.htm">Catholic Educational Association</a> has already done much towards unifying and systematizing our <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> schools. The training of teachers is, as a rule, provided for by the different <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities engaged in the work of teaching. There are no <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> institutions for the training of the teachers for the whole diocese. During the summer of 1911 a regular session of the <a href="../cathen/03455a.htm">Catholic University of America</a> was held for the benefit of the teaching sisterhoods. Of the three hundred who attended, a large percentage took up professional pedagogical subjects. Similar institutes were held at <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, and elsewhere. In the autumn of the same year the Sisters' College was formally opened at Brookland, D. C., under the auspices of the <a href="../cathen/03455a.htm">Catholic University of America</a>, and of the twenty-nine students who attended the first session all took professional courses in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The number of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> schools in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in 1911 was, according to the "Catholic Directory", 4972, and the number of pupils 1,270,131. These figures do not include <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>, which numbered 285 and took care of 51,938 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>. Neither do they include the non-parochial academies, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> boarding schools, and day schools, nor the colleges for boys, many of which have a number of primary pupils in attendance.
<h2>Australia</h2>

<p>In Australia as in the other parts of the British Empire, the struggle in defence of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> has been a hard, uphill fight. Even in the present age the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Australia, who have by the most generous and devoted <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> created a fine system of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, both primary and secondary, have not the right, which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> enjoy, to have any share whatever in the large sums of public money expended on the schools, whilst they are compelled to contribute this money in the form of taxes and rates.
<h3>History</h3>

<p>From 1788, when Governor Philip first established a colonial settlement at Port Jackson, until 1826, the only schools available for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children in the colony were the officially controlled <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> schools, on which large grants of money and land were lavished. The devoted <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> Father Therry started a small school in 1826, for which he managed to obtain a little Government aid. By 1836 there were thirteen <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools. Through the influence of Governor Bourke, a liberal <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, a system of State aid recognizing the various <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> was developed, a Denominational Board for distributing the funds was set up, and a modest allowance was secured by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. But in 1848 a National Secular System was introduced with a Central Board of Education somewhat similar to that existing in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, yet running concomitantly with the existing Denominational Board. Hostility between the two was inevitable, and there were many inconveniences. By the Public School Act of 1866 a Central Council of Education was established and sundry changes were introduced, some being to the detriment of the denominational schools; for the defence of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> a Catholic Association was formed. But the secular movement supported by anti-Catholic prejudice grew in strength and, by the Public Instruction Act of 1880, a centralized secular system, withdrawing all State aid from the denominational schools, was completely established in New South Wales; this had been done already in some of the other States, and as time went on was done also in the remaining. The effect of the measure was the speedy extinction of the great majority of the other denominational schools, whilst the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, thrown again entirely on their own resources, started to build and support their schools (both primary and secondary), the numbers of which they have since then largely increased. The secular system has thus been in force in the State schools for thirty years, but the situation's not acquiesced in by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; they continue to demand the right as free citizens to have the money which they pay in taxes for the support of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> expended on the only <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> which they can conscientiously accept.
<h3>Present status of Catholic education</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> primary schools are under the authority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. There are no school boards; inspectors appointed by <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> authority examine and report on the schools. Competitive yearly interprimary school examinations for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> secondary school scholarships give an extra stimulus to individual work. In some states Government inspectors are invited to visit the schools, but only in three states does the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> enforce Government inspection. These schools are taxed like ordinary institutions; where they come into competition with the State schools, e.g. for civil service appointments, they win more than their share of successes. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> secondary schools and high schools for boys and girls are numerous, and are in charge of the religious congregations. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> have four colleges, and the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Vincentian</a> and <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marist Fathers</a> (N. Z.) one each. The remainder are divided among the <a href="../cathen/03710b.htm">Christian</a>, <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marist</a>, Patrician, and <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">De La Salle</a> Brothers. Secondary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> is largely guided by the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> examinations, and here again the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools amply prove their efficiency. Victoria (Tasmania lately passed a similar law) by Act of Parliament (1906) exacts the registration of all private schools both primary and secondary, and of all teachers. An Educational Council, on which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are represented, has charge of the register, determines the conditions of registration, and adjudicates on individual claims. Vested interests are respected, but evidence of competency is to be required of all future teachers. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are endeavouring to meet the new conditions by the establishment of training colleges, especially for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. In New South Wales, where similar legislation is probable, <a href="../cathen/14366a.htm">Cardinal Moran</a> (d. 6 Aug., 1911) in 1911 established a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Council of Education to safeguard <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests.

<p>In Australasia, including <a href="../cathen/10783a.htm">New Guinea</a>, there are: <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> primary schools, 1004; superior day schools, 196; boarding schools for girls, 194; colleges for boys, 27; <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminaries</a>, 5; and one college for foreign missions. The estimated total <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is 982,578; scholars, 123,905. The great majority of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers are from among the 6000 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> and 549 brothers who devote their lives to the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the country. Lay teachers are chiefly employed in the country districts. The <em>per capita</em> cost of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> primary schools averages between &pound;3 and &pound;4; in the State schools, between &pound;5 and &pound;6. The amount saved to the State by the self-sacrifice of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body totals annually about three-quarters of a million pounds. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools are maintained by the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> contributions of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>--<a href="../cathen/04104b.htm">church collections</a>, concerts, bazaars etc.--and the gratuitous labours of the religious. The classes in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> primary schools are graded in a system somewhat similar to that in the Government schools. In some of the states, notably in New South Wales, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> school authorities have been able to issue special <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> school readers and periodical school papers. As an offset to the Government scholarships, which unlike those in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> are tenable only at the Government high schools, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have founded scholarships in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> secondary schools for their primary school children. Technical instruction is usually included in the curriculum of the larger schools, but is more systematically organized in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutions for <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> and industrial work.
<h2>Canada</h2>

<p>Canada is a self-governing dominion of the British Empire consisting of nine provinces and some territories not yet erected in provinces. Its population is partly French in origin and language, partly British. It will be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, in order to be accurate, to speak of each province separately.
<h3>Ontario</h3>

<p>The beginnings of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a> may be said to date back to the year 1615, in which the Recollect <a href="../cathen/09107c.htm">Joseph Le Caron</a>, making a journey of exploration in the countries of the <a href="../cathen/01311b.htm">Algonquin</a> and <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> tribes, decided on the foundation of missions in their midst. Writing to the Court of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, he said: "We must first make men of these Indians, then <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>." During the years 1622-26, his first efforts were assisted by the arrival of Fathers Guillaume Poulin, <a href="../cathen/15416a.htm">Nicholas Viel</a>, and de La Roche d'Aillon, of his order, and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> Br&eacute;beuf and de La Noue. Their work was facilitated by the aid of interpreters who were good <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and valiant auxiliaries. By 1638 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>, now ten in number, had established two residences on the banks of Georgian Bay. These outposts speedily became centres of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> civilization. Until 1650 the missionaries, with their devoted <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> and coadjutors from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, were the only <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers of <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a>. Their first lessons of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>, of book-knowledge, and of agriculture, given amidst the greatest privations, and often at the peril of their lives, owed much more to their unlimited <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> than to any generosity on the part of their pupils. In 1649 the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> and <a href="../cathen/01311b.htm">Algonquin</a> <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> were exterminated by the ferocious <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>, who burnt or destroyed seven flourishing missions, which had been directed by no fewer than sixty missionaries and helpers, many of whom perished with their flocks. The surviving heroes of the Gospel found a new field of action among the Outaouais, who inhabited the present County of Bruce, the islands of Georgian Bay, and Great Manitoulin Island. The work that had been done for the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a> and <a href="../cathen/01311b.htm">Algonquins</a> of Eastern <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a> was now renewed on behalf of the Western tribes. Nothing that human <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> could accomplish was spared to make of them civilized people and fervent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. When Antoine* de La Mothe Cadillac founded the important post of <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a> (1701), he was accompanied by missionaries, among whom was the Rev. Father Lhalle, who became <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the pioneers of Essex. The Iroquet tribe, belonging to the large <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01311b.htm">Algonquins</a>, settled in the farthest eastern end of the province in the present Counties of Stormont, Glengarry, and Prescott, received at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the joyful tidings of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> and the benefit of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>.

<p>After the War of American Independence, a great number of settlers, faithful to the British flag, took refuge in the <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Province of Ontario</a>. The first immigrants established themselves at Indian Point, in the vicinity of <a href="../cathen/08658a.htm">Kingston</a>, in 1784. Later on, other loyalists took up homesteads at <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a> and Niagara. The few <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> who had followed de La Mothe Cadillac to Detroit survived to constitute the colony of Essex, and their descendants rapidly invaded both the Counties of Essex and Kent, where the French population now almost forms a majority. In 1786 and 1802 Scotch emigrants settled in large numbers in the Counties of Glengarry and Prescott. From 1816 to 1825 British officers and furloughed soldiers, mostly <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, colonized the districts of Carleton, Lanark, and <a href="../cathen/11756b.htm">Peterborough</a>. The construction of the Rideau Canal caused a large number of workmen to take up their residence in <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a>. An entire colony of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotch</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, expelled from the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> after the War of Independence on account of their attachment to the British Crown, settled in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> near Niagara, in the Counties of Lincoln and Welland. A vigorous stream of immigration from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in 1835 overflowed the western end of the province, in the present Counties of Bruce, Huron, and Perth. Meanwhile <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> poured into the Counties of Russell, Prescott, and Glengarry. Raftsmen and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> of various occupations ascended the Ottawa River, exploring the regions now known as New Ontario, Algoma, Nipissing, and Thunder Bay. They are now in a majority in these three counties, and have churches, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and schools of their own.

<p>This <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> immigration, so abundant and sudden, incited the ardent <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Mgr Plessis, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec, to send missionaries to Upper <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Priests from the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Quebec, others from the foreign missionary organization of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and a small number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who had immigrated with their Scotch or <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> countrymen ministered to the spiritual wants of these <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a> colonists. They joyfully accepted their share of the great poverty of these pioneers. They thought more of preserving the Faith, of administering the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and of reforming abuses than of founding schools. Not that they considered schools as of little importance, but because, from lack of resources and teachers, the establishment of schools was an impossibility. From 1830, however, Toronto had its <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> school; then <a href="../cathen/08658a.htm">Kingston</a>, in 1837 and Picton, in 1840, were likewise provided for. The <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, ever anxious to foster the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the people confided to its care, was soon established in the province. This was the signal for the opening of educational establishments at divers points. Ottawa had its <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools in 1844; Brantford in 1850; Goderich and Peterborough in 1852; Hamilton, Oshawa, and Barrie in 1855; Perth and Alexandria in 1856; Orillia in 1857; Berlin, Dundas, and St. Thomas in 1858; Belleville in 1860, and so on. The venerable Bishops A. McDonell, R. Gaulin, Power, Guiges, O.M.I., de Charbonel, Pinsonnault, Jamot, Farrell, and Phelan; Fathers J. Ryan, Proulx, Grand, Maloney, Carayon, Grattan, Bissey, Jeffrey, Bilroy, Lawler, Faure, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> du Ranquet, Hanipaux, Ch&ocirc;n&eacute;, Fr&eacute;miol, the Oblate Fathers Tilmon, Dandurand, Tabaret, Soulerin, Manroit, and the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> Fathers--these were the pioneers and defenders of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a>. They found very able helpers in the various <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>. Many sincerely <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> among the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> also devoted themselves to the cause of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the province. Among the earliest and most remarkable may be mentioned, at <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a>, J. Harvey and J. Seyers; at <a href="../cathen/11352a.htm">Ottawa</a>, Dr. Riel, Friolle, and Goode; at Dundas, Miss Sweeney; at Brantford, J. d'Astroph; at Oakland, Capt. Fitzgerald.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools have become numerous and powerful. Their organization, from the points of view of studies, discipline, and regular attendance of pupils, is better than that of all other institutions of the same class in the province. Many years have already elapsed since in the cities, villages, and other parts of the country, long opened up to colonization, the old square-timber school-houses were replaced by splendid buildings of brick or stone. The architecture of these schools is simple and beautiful; the systems of ventilation, lighting, and heating are excellent; the installation of suitable school furniture and accessories is almost complete. This progress is very evident, even in centres of colonization. The school trustees make it a point of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to put up school buildings which are beautiful and spacious, and which leave nothing to be desired in ventilation, lighting, and heating. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools of <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a> are called separate schools. They do separate, in fact, for school purposes, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> minority from the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> majority. They make it possible for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to withdraw their children from the public or common schools, which are by law <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. Nevertheless, there are some public schools which are really <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>; these exist in localities exclusively or almost exclusively <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Such schools are found especially in the Counties of Russell, Prescott, Algoma, Nipissing, Kent, and Essex. Separate schools were granted in 1841, when the Provinces of Upper and Lower <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> were united. Wishing to secure for their co-religionists in Lower <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> exemption from the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of sending their children to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools (common schools in that province), and of paying taxes for the support of said schools, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a> and Quebec proposed to establish a system of dissident or separate schools. What they claimed for the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of Lower <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> they had to bind themselves in strict <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to grant to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Upper <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>.

<p>The principle of separate schools, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> in Quebec, received the royal sanction on 18 September, 1841. This fundamental law had been discussed by a committee of the Legislative Assembly in which Lower <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> was represented by fifteen members and Upper <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> by eight. This law authorized dissidents from the common schools, on giving notice to the clerk of the district council, to pay their school taxes for the support of separate schools, and to receive a share of the government grants for <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in proportion to their number. The same law authorized the election by the people of trustees for the administration of separate schools. The governor was authorized to nominate in each city a board of examiners composed of an equal number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a> obtained the privilege of establishing a separate board for the examination of candidates wishing to teach in their schools; a clause in this fundamental law exempted the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a> from submitting to examination by this board. From 1841 to 1863, at almost every session of the Legislature, the <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> proposed amendments to the act establishing separate schools. These amendments tended, for the most part, to render the existence of separate schools in <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a> so precarious that they would die out of themselves. The desired privileges for the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of Lower <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> had been obtained; it was well known that these privileges would always be respected by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> majority of Quebec; now, they thought, it would be safe to deliver the attacks of unenlightened fanaticism against the separate schools of Upper <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Cost what it might, the cry was raised for a single school system for the whole of Upper <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>--a common, public, or national school system. While constantly professing motives of the purest <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and common interest, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Province of Upper <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> has continually sullied its reputation for fairness by setting an example of fanaticism, narrow-mindedness, and intolerance towards <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools, whilst Lower <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> province, has been a model of perfect <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and toleration.

<p>On 27 February, 1863, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> deputy, R. W. Scott, presented for the fourth time a new law to govern the separate schools. This law was adopted, thanks to the generous aid given by the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> deputies, mostly from Lower <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. The Upper <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> majority voted against the bill, but all the members from Quebec and twenty-one members from Upper <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, among them several <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, were in its favour and carried the measure.

<p>1f <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a> now possesses a system of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> separate schools, it is largely due to the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> of Lower <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, whose wishes in the matter were enforced by their representatives, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. This law, enacted in 1863, was maintained at the time of the confederation of the provinces in 1867; it still governs today the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> separate schools of <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a>. Yet it is far from giving to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of that province liberties equal to those enjoyed by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> minority of Quebec. It recognizes the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> separate schools for primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> only. Secondary or superior <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a> is <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have their academies, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, colleges, and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, but these are independent schools, supported by the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> contributions of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who have also to contribute, on the same footing as <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, to the support of the government high schools, collegiate institutes, and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>. It refuses to separate schools the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to a share of the taxes paid by public-utility companies, such as railway, tramway and telephone companies, banks, etc. It withholds from the trustees of separate schools the right of expropriation in order to secure more fitting localities for their schools. It refuses to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> father of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to pay his taxes towards the support of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools. It allows <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> the option of paying their taxes to support the public schools. As the rate of taxation for separate schools is generally higher than that for public schools, owing to the large number of children in <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> minority, and to the abstention of large business concerns from contributing the least support to the separate schools, it follows that many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, more or less sincere, avoid the higher rate and pay their taxes towards the support of the public, or <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, schools. The separate schools are administered, as by a court of final <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, by the Education Department at <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are not represented.

<p>The law governing the separate schools nevertheless gives to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> the following <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>: <ul><li>(1) To pay their taxes for primary schools in which religious instruction is given, and of which the teachers, inspectors and textbooks are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>; <li>(2) To administer these schools by a board of trustees elected by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> proprietors and residents of the different school sections; <li>(3) To fix the rate of school-taxation; <li>(4) To have these school-taxes collected by the tax-collector of the city or township; <li>(5) To negotiate loans for the election of school buildings; <li>(6) To engage teachers.</ul>

<p>The board of trustees has likewise the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to impose the teaching in French or German of reading, spelling and literature, as provided for by the regulations of the Education Department, page 9, article 15, year 1907. The <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a>, availing themselves of this right, have the <a href="../cathen/06190a.htm">French language</a> taught in 250 schools, frequented almost entirely by their children. The Government has named three <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> inspectors for these schools, called bilingual. The teachers of these schools are trained in two public bilingual training-schools, one at Sturgeon Falls and the other at <a href="../cathen/11352a.htm">Ottawa</a>, founded and supported by the Government, and directed by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principals. The certificates issued by these schools give the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to teach in the bilingual schools for five years only. The Government makes a yearly grant to both <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and public schools, the amount being calculated upon the value of the schoolhouse, the excellence of its furnishings, the certificates and salaries of the teachers, and the attendance of the children. The statistics for 1909, taken from the Report of the Minister of Education, are as follows:

<h3>Quebec</h3>

<h4>French rule (1635-1763)</h4>

<h5>Primary schools</h5>

<p>With the introduction of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, schools sprang up in the French colony even among the remotest tribes. The Recollects were the first schoolmasters of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. In 1616, one of them, Brother Pacifique Duplessis, opened, at <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a>, the first school of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a>. Shortly afterwards the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> followed them, teaching the children reading, writing, arithmetic, and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>. In 1634, a year after the arrival of the pioneer <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, an elementary school was founded in Quebec. As colonists increased, primary schools sprang up. The boys' schools were at St. Foy, the Island of Orl&eacute;ans, Point Levis, Ch&acirc;teau-Richer, Quebec, <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a>. Proofs exist that there were in the city and district of Quebec 15 primary schools for boys; in the city and district of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, 10; in the city and district of <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a>, 7. Among the organizers were Mgr Laval and his <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. Mgr de St-Vallier, his successor, encouraged elementary, secondary, and technical schools by every means in his power. In the district of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> the Sulpician Fathers founded several schools. M. Souart, superior of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> from 1661 to 1668, took <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> in styling himself the first schoolmaster of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a>; all his brethren shared his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. In 1715 Brother Charon opened a school for boys at Pointe-aux Trembles, near <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, and took upon himself the charge of recruiting teachers for the country districts. In investigating the history of the schools in pioneer days we invariably find as their founder or benefactor a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, a religious congregation, or a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, himself a school-teacher or assisted by a teacher who travelled from one district to another.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the girls was as carefully attended to as that of the boys. The <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> built schools at Quebec and <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> of the H&ocirc;pital G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de Qu&eacute;bec erected a boarding school, while the Sisters of the Congregation de Notre Dame, founded by the Venerable Marguerite Bourgeoys, multiplied <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, Quebec, <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a>, and in the country districts, where the children of the colonists came to be trained in all things essential to the development of a strong <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> character. Charlevoix says: "If to this day, there prevail in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> so great a gentleness in the manners of all classes of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and so much charm in the intercourse of life, it is owing in great measure to the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Marguerite Bourgeoys". Twelve houses were opened by the Congregation of Notre Dame during the period of French rule.

<h5>Special schools</h5>

<p>Specializing in teaching was not unknown at this epoch when existence itself was a struggle. There were schools of mathematics and hydrography at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and the Charon Brothers', art and trade schools at the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Quebec, art and trade schools at St. Joachim, art and trade schools at the Charon Brothers.

<h5>Secondary schools</h5>

<p>While defending the colony from the incursions of the Indians and fighting to retain their prior right of possession, the French not only established primary and special schools but founded and endowed secondary schools. The classical college of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> was established at a time when the population of the entire country was but a few hundred <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and the <em>Petit S&eacute;minaire</em> of Quebec opened its doors on October, 1688.

<h4>British rule (1763-1910)</h4>

<p>In 1763 60,000 French <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colonists passed by right of conquest under British <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> rule. The progress of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools was greatly impeded. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, through her teaching communities and <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, organized schools in the most important villages; but, unfortunately, a great number of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were without <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>. In 1801 the Legislature passed a law entitled "An Act to establish Free Schools", which provided for the establishment of a permanent corporation known as the Royal Institute. Thus the monopoly was given to the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a> to establish and support <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">English Protestant</a> schools for a population almost entirely made up of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, Scattered over the country districts, in the midst of a mistrustful people, the schools of the Royal Institute were patronized by the English colonists only. Twenty-four years after its foundation the Royal Institute had only 37 schools with 1048 pupils. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> schools increased. At <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> and the Ladies of the Congregation of Notre Dame opened free schools. A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was founded at Quebec to teach poor children and train teachers for country districts. Many other <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> were formed in different parts of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> for a similar purpose. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were few that could not boast of fairly good schools. Private or independent schools increased more rapidly than the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> schools. In 1824 the Legislature passed the Parochial School Act authorizing the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and church-wardens to appropriate a fourth part of the revenue of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> corporation for the support of the schools under their exclusive control. In 1829 there were no less than 14,700 children in these schools which were supported at the cost of much sacrifice by a poor and scattered population. Many other attempts were made to organize <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools until, finally, in 1841, a law was passed wherein were contained the principal provisions of the Educational Act as it exists in the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a> today. This law, considerably augmented by that of 1846, gave a great impetus to public instruction. In 1849 there were 1817 schools and 68,904 pupils. Owing to the influence of <a href="../cathen/10147b.htm">Dr. Meilleur</a>, Superintendent of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Schools of Quebec, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> made rapid progress. Chaveau, his successor, continued to work with the same <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. He established three primary denominational normal schools in Lower <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, two for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who were in a great majority, the third for <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. In <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a>, there was but one normal school, for the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> majority, who neglected to do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> minority, while Quebec gave to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, who were in the minority, a separate normal school.

<p>The school organization of the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a> is now under the control of the Department of Public Instruction. The president, who is elected for life, is non-partisan in politics and bears the title of Superintendent of Education. He is assisted by a French and an English secretary, who are charged with the administration of the affairs of their respective nationalities and co-religionists. The Council of Public Instruction is composed of highly esteemed members, chosen from the two <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">religious denominations</a>; they frame <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and rules relating to public instruction which are afterwards submitted to the sanction of the government. The Council of Public Instruction is divided into <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> sections. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> committee includes as ex-officio members the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or administrators of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and Apostolic vicariates of the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>, and a number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> committee is composed of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> members equal in number to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> committee. Apart from these two committees, there are other members who do not form part of the Council of Public Instruction, but who have, in their respective committees, the same power as the members of the committees. These two committees, which sit independently, unite, under the presidency of the superintendent of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, when there are matters to discuss that interest both <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">religious denominations</a>. All questions relating exclusively to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> or to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> are decided by their respective religious committees.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a> is divided into school municipalities for the support of one or more schools. These municipalities are subdivided into school districts, and are entrusted to the commissioners or trustees elected by the taxpayers. In large cities, like Quebec and <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, the commissioners are named by the Government on the suggestion of the superintendent of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and the city itself. The commissioners are the local directors and real supervisors of the school; they have charge of the administration; they name the teachers; dispose of school <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, purchase ground and build schoolhouses, impose and collect the school taxes and fees. Taxpayers who do not profess the same religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> as the majority of the inhabitants in the municipality where they reside, have a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to a school commission of their own, composed of three members chosen from among their co-religionists. These members, called school trustees, represent the dissenting minority; they have the same privileges as the commissioners.

<p>The administration of public schools is controlled by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> school inspectors for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools, and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> for non-Catholic schools. These functionaries are subject to the superintendent of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. There are also two general inspectors charged respectively with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> normal schools. The first inspectors were named, in 1852. At present (1911) thirty-nine <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> inspectors, under the supervision of a general inspector, visit the 6000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools of the province. The school revenues are obtained from government grants and local taxation, The operation of this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> exhibits striking <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a> and fairness of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who constitute the great majority: they organize their schools, but never take advantage of their numbers to force <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> to send their children to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools. All <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> wishing to teach in public schools under the administration of school commissioners and trustees must obtain diplomas from a normal school or from the Central Board of Examiners. Nevertheless, <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of religion and members of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities of both sexes are exempt from these examinations. Members of teaching orders, after completing their course of studies, make a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of two, three, or four years before receiving their "obedience". This period of normal training exempts them from the examinations imposed on lay teachers by the Central Board of Examiners. Primary teaching comprises three degrees: the elementary course (4 years), the intermediate course (2 years), and the superior course (2 years). Schools of the first degree are called primary elementary; those of the second, model, or primary intermediate; those of the third, academic, or primary superior. In the following table of statistics of elementary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a> for the year 1909-10, those schools which are subject to the provincial or the municipal Government are classed as "State"; the others, as "Independent".

<p>The teaching congregations direct a large number of schools, independent or under the control of different school commissions. The <a href="../cathen/03710b.htm">Christian Brothers</a> have 63 houses in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, 51 in the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>, 750 brothers and about 23,000 pupils. The following are the other teaching congregations of men: Clerks of St. Viateur, Brothers of Charity, Marist Brothers, <a href="../cathen/13305a.htm">Brothers of the Sacred Heart</a>, <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of Christian Instruction</a>, <a href="../cathen/06330b.htm">Brothers of St. Gabriel</a>, <a href="../cathen/04539b.htm">Brothers of the Cross of Jesus</a> (<a href="../cathen/13058a.htm">Diocese of Rimouski</a>). Among the teaching congregations of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are: the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, with houses in the Dioceses of Quebec, <a href="../cathen/03658a.htm">Chicoutimi</a>, <a href="../cathen/13756d.htm">Sherbrooke</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13058a.htm">Rimouski</a>. There are also <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Diocese of Three Rivers</a>; this house was founded by Mgr J.-C. de St-Vallier, second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec. The Congregation of Notre Dame, founded at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, 30 April, 1657, by Venerable Marguerite Bourgeoys (1620-1700), possesses 131 houses in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. It numbers 1510 professed sisters, 240 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, 45 <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a>. The Sisters teach 34,000 pupils in 21 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07031a.htm">Grey Nuns</a> of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, <a href="../cathen/11352a.htm">Ottawa</a>, Quebec, and St. Hyacinthe teach a great number of children. The <a href="../cathen/10678a.htm">Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary</a> have their mother-house at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> and houses both in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>; professed religious, 1257; <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, 110; <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a>, 81; establishments, 74; <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> schools, 32; pupils, 24,208. Other congregations are: the Ladies of the Sacred Heart, the Sisters of Providence, Sisters of the Good Shepherd, Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, <a href="../cathen/07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a> and Seven Dolors (544 religious, 14,577 pupils in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>), Sisters of St. Anne (63 establishments in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, 19,190 pupils), <a href="../cathen/02006a.htm">Sisters of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin</a>, Nicolet (414 religious, 49 establishments), Sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin, Religious of Jesus and Mary, <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> (St. Hyacinthe), <a href="../cathen/15668a.htm">Daughters of Wisdom</a>, Sisters of St. Mary, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> of Mary (Quebec), <a href="../cathen/11699a.htm">Sisters of Our Lady of Perpetual Help</a>, Sisters of the Holy Heart of Mary, Sisters of Our Lady of Good Counsel (Chicoutimi), <a href="../cathen/08374a.htm">Daughters of Jesus</a>, Sisters of Charity of St. Louis, Religious of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>. Many of these congregations have mother-houses in the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>; they direct a great number of establishments and send missionaries to the other provinces of the Dominion and to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.

<p>There are thirteen art and trade schools in the principal centres of the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>. During the school year 1909-10 there were 56 professors, 2632 boys. Besides the Agricultural Institute at Oka, affiliated to <a href="../cathen/09047b.htm">Laval University</a>, and which is included in the scheme of superior <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, there is an agricultural school in connexion with the College of St. Anne de La Pocati&egrave;re, in the district of Quebec. There is a manual training and agricultural school for girls, under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, at Roberval, Lake St. John district; another at St. Pascal, under the direction of the Sisters of the Congregation of Notre Dame. Normal schools were founded in 1856. There are now ten; two for boys and eight for girls. Three normal schools for girls are soon to be opened, so that each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a> will have its own normal school. The pupils number 660; the professors, 110. There is one <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> school for the blind (boys and girls), the Nazareth Institute, directed by the <a href="../cathen/07031a.htm">Grey Nuns</a>; fifty-five pupils follow the regular course, under the direction of five professors; many excel in music and in other subjects. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Deaf and Dumb Institute, for boys, is directed by the Clerks of St. Viateur. The total number of pupils is 135, of whom 89 are instructed by the oral method, 46 by the written and manual alphabet. The work of teaching is carried on by 31 professors. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Deaf and Dumb Institute for girls is directed by the Sisters of Providence; 71 sisters teach 142 pupils. The two methods are in use, but the oral method is employed in instructing almost all the pupils. Former pupils, numbering 115, are engaged in manual labour in these asylums, receiving physical,intellectual, and moral care.

<p>The night-schools, numbering 129, have taught 2546 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> pupils. There are a certain number of industrial schools. The Brothers of Charity direct a reform school (30 religious, 118 boarders). The Sisters of the Good Shepherd also have two houses, one at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, the other at Park Laval. A great number of congregations are charged with the instruction of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>; among the institutions may be mentioned the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">Orphan Asylum</a> of Montfort, 305 children, Huberdeau, 220. The Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Society of Mary</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15668a.htm">Daughters of Wisdom</a> have charge of these <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>. All the principal cities have their kindergarten schools, which are not mentioned in the official reports. They are due to private initiative and are organized by <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities. There are 21 classical colleges at Quebec, 18 of which are affiliated with <a href="../cathen/09047b.htm">Laval University</a>. They were founded by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, or <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> who understood the needs of the different phases of the national and religious existence. Therein were fostered vocations to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and the liberal professions. These classical colleges have given <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> eminent men, both in <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, who, in the dark hours of its history, have preserved its <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and nationality; they have flourished and are still flourishing, thanks to the generosity of their founders and former pupils. They receive but $12,643 from the Provincial Legislature. The accompanying table of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colleges of the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a> exhibits the dates of their respective foundations as well as the number of pupils and professors in each.

<p>English is the mother tongue of only a little more than 9 per cent of all the pupils attending these twenty-one institutions, the language of the remainder being French. The Classical course, including two years of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, covers a period of eight years. It includes the study of Greek and Latin, to which educators, in certain countries, are coming back after having tried to abolish it. The study of the dead languages does not diminish the student's ardour for the two official languages of the country, French and English. Mount St. Louis, directed by the <a href="../cathen/03710b.htm">Christian Brothers</a>, has a modern secondary course without Greek or Latin. They prepare young men principally for the polytechnical schools. The classical colleges affiliated with <a href="../cathen/09047b.htm">Laval University</a> have the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> course of studies and examinations. In 1910 a new school was opened for the <em>hautes &eacute;tudes commerciales,</em> and about twenty-six pupils have followed the courses. In 1911 the Legislature organized two technical schools: one at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, the other at Quebec.

<p>In 1908 the Sisters of the Congregation of Notre Dame opened a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. It is affiliated with <a href="../cathen/09047b.htm">Laval University</a>, and embraces English, French, and commercial sections. The regular course, leading to the degrees of B.L., B.S., <a href="../cathen/01756c.htm">B.A.</a>, includes two, three, or four years' study according to the anterior preparation of the student. About seventy-five follow the regular course. A large number attend the public lectures. The final examinations of the year are submitted to <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> professors. The staff of sixteen religious is assisted by professors.
<h3>Nova Scotia</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> was introduced in the Province of Nova Scotia by the French with the first settlement of the country; but the first mention which we have of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> school <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> dates only from thirty years later, when the Recollects opened at <a href="../cathen/12295a.htm">Port-Royal</a> a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for the instruction of French and Indian children. This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> was evidently continued, since we find a <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> Father writing, in 1652: "Emmanuel Le Borgne, governor of <a href="../cathen/01090a.htm">Acadia</a>, has expelled from Port-Royal Madame de Brice d'Auxerre, superioress of the School for the Abenaquis". About 1680 the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, Petit, says in a letter to his superior, Mgr Vallier, that he has with him a man who teaches the boys of Port-Royal. Mgr Vallier himself first sends a Sister of the Congregation of Notre Dame to teach the Indian and French girls of Port-Royal, and a few years after, in 1686, he sends for Geoffrey, a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Sulpician, "to continue the instruction of youth which so far has been so well looked after". In fact Geoffroy improved the school teaching and supervising. He also laid the foundation for the future coming of the Sisters of the Cross, who came in 1701, after the capture of Port-Royal by Phipps and the cession of <a href="../cathen/01090a.htm">Acadia</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1697. After the final taking of <a href="../cathen/01090a.htm">Acadia</a> by the English it seems that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools were abolished, as we find Father Burke writing: "There is a great desire to establish a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> School [in Halifax]. The need is pressing. We would succeed if we could have repealed an <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> law forbidding <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Schools". Through the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries, however, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was not altogether neglected. In the western part of <a href="../cathen/11135a.htm">Nova Scotia</a>, for example, we find a <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the Abb&eacute; Sigogne, urging his flock to send their children to school, organizing Sunday schools; thanks to his labours for the cause of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, there were in 1851, in the district of Clare alone, 17 schools attended by 422 pupils.

<p>In 1864 the Law of Common Schools was passed in the Provincial Legislature of Nova Scotia. Since then there have been very few separate schools properly so called. Under this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> the province is divided into districts called schools sections, which are administered by a board of three trustees elected by the ratepayers of the section. It is the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the trustees to engage teachers and to pay them out of the funds derived partly from taxes directly imposed upon the inhabitants of the section and partly from government grants. According to law, the teaching of the Catechism is prohibited during regular school hours; but the trustees may instruct teachers to give lessons in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> during one half-hour after class every day. Inspectors are appointed by the Council of Public Instruction to visit the schools and report upon them to the superintendent of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Some of these schools are under the direction of religious teaching communities as follows: In the <a href="../cathen/07117b.htm">Diocese of Halifax</a> the Sisters of Charity have charge of nine such schools, four in the city of <a href="../cathen/07117b.htm">Halifax</a> and five in the Acadian <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of Meteghan, Church Point, Eal Brook, and West Pubnico, and the English-speaking <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Prospect. In the <a href="../cathen/01562c.htm">Diocese of Antigonish</a> the Sisters of the Congregation of Notre Dame conduct seven of these schools, with 37 religious and 2281 pupils; the Sisters of Charity, 5 schools; the <a href="../cathen/08374a.htm">Daughters of Jesus</a>, 2.

<p>Besides these schools organized under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, the Ladies of the Sacred Heart of Jesus have a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> school at <a href="../cathen/07117b.htm">Halifax</a> with 48 religious and 500 pupils; the Sisters of Charity, a separate school at Amherst and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> at Rockingham Meteghan, and Church Point; the Sisters of the Congregation, at New Glasgow and Pictou; and the Filles de J&eacute;sus at Arichat and Cheticamp. These separate schools are supported by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of their respective towns. There are also three <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colleges for boys in the Province: <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> (English), at <a href="../cathen/01562c.htm">Antigonish</a>, with 15 professors and 200 pupils; St. Anne, at Church Point, with 18 professors and 180 pupils (French and English), and St. Mary, at <a href="../cathen/07117b.htm">Halifax</a>, with 7 professors and 80 pupils.
<h3>New Brunswick</h3>

<p>As had been the case in <a href="../cathen/11135a.htm">Nova Scotia</a>, the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools in New Brunswick were opened by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries; and when the regrettable deportation took place, it could be said that a great number of <a href="../cathen/01090a.htm">Acadians</a> were able at least to read their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and also the exercises relating to the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a>. One can easily understand how these poor exiles returned to their country and more particularly to New Brunswick. Their first care was undoubtedly to assure their very existence, as a great number of those who escaped deportation died of hunger and cold in the forest and on the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> banks of the gulf. Next, they asked for missionaries and for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> capable of teaching reading and writing to their children. For lack of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> they had to be content on Sunday with reading the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for Mass, and it was imperative to teach their children the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of religion as contained in the short <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>. Fifty years and more passed before it became possible for them--such was their extreme poverty, and so precarious the conditions of their existence--to procure the service of any school-teacher. However, at the close of the Napoleonic Wars, adventurers, sailors, deserters, or tourists came from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to read and write, and their services were eagerly accepted. The old residents still remember M. Grenet, who taught at Barachois, M. Gabriel Albert, who taught at Grande Digue, M. Jean Lem&eacute;nager, who taught at Memramcook, M. Alexandre Th&eacute;odore, who taught at Petit-Codiac (Ruisseau du Renard) and in neighbouring <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>.

<p>Then came the Abb&eacute; Antoine* Gagnon, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Barachois, of Grande Digue, of Sh&eacute;diac (G&eacute;daique), etc., who founded a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at Grande Digue. This school remained open for two years (1833 to 1835), with three teachers, Messrs. Des Varennes, Braidly, and Gosselin. When the lands and properties of this institution were afterwards sold, the proceeds were placed in the hands of Mgr Sweeney, in trust for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of young Acadians, in the event of another college being built in the diocese for any other similar purpose. During the first years that followed the return of the Acadians, after their dispersion, teachers boarded with the scholars' <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> in turn, and received from $3 to $5 per scholar, which means that only the prosperous centres could procure their services. In those days the Acadians received from the British <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> authorities the fulness of their political and civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> without molestation or annoyance in things religious or relating to the <a href="../cathen/06190a.htm">French language</a>. The thinly populated country did not as yet complain of the burden of its school <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>.

<p>The first act to be found in the Statutes of New Brunswick concerning <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1805 and relates to the founding of a public grammar school for the City of <a href="../cathen/13355a.htm">Saint John</a>. It is therein enacted that the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of Trinity Church shall be one of the directors of this school, and at the same time president of the Board of Administration. A somewhat paltry grant was awarded to this establishment. In the same manner, other grammar schools were authorized for different localities in New Brunswick. The first law establishing public <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> schools dates from 1833. These schools are placed under the control of three school trustees for each <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. These trustees possess great executive authority. They subdivide the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> into school districts, engage and dismiss teachers, and give them such certificates as entitle them to their grants from the Government, the maximum of which is $160 for each <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. The justices of the peace are entrusted with the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of making school reports to the Government. No certificate of competence was exacted beyond the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> syndics, and no examination as to aptitude was held. It was not until many years afterwards (towards 1853) that the Board of Education, with its <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> and inspectors, was definitely organized. These latter, until the events of 1871, always showed kindness and liberality towards <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> and the French tongue. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers received from the board their grant, as did also the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> teachers, French and English alike. In 1871 a law was passed by the Provincial Legislature establishing "Neutral Schools", in which the <a href="../cathen/06190a.htm">French language</a> was ignored; but it was taught in the French schools and was afterwards recognized officially. The French and the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> protested energetically against this <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> measure. Petitions were signed and sent to Ottawa requesting the repeal of this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, which was injurious to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who constituted one-third of the population of the Province. Some turbulent and stormy years passed over; certain defenders of the minority were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, and finally a <em>modus vivendi</em> was adopted to the effect that the school remain neutral from 9 A. M. till 3.30 <font size=-2>P. M.</font> The books shall be approved by the Government. The use of the <a href="../cathen/06190a.htm">French language</a> was recognized, and a set of books was chosen to that end.

<p>After the regular school hours the Catechism was permitted to be taught. Nowadays all the schools of New Brunswick are under the control of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, even those exclusively attended by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children. The number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children frequenting the schools is about 23,000; the teachers, male and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a>, number about 600. About eighteen <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> under the direction of various religious congregations are scattered through the principal centres of the province. There are three colleges: one at <a href="../cathen/03642a.htm">Chatham</a> (English) founded in 1910, directed by the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> Fathers, and containing 90 pupils; one at Caraquet, French and English, founded in 1899 by the <a href="../cathen/05596b.htm">Eudist</a> Fathers, and containing 150 pupils; one at Memramcook (l'Universit&eacute; du Coll&egrave;ge Saint-Joseph), French and English, founded in 1864, directed by the Fathers of the Holy Cross, and containing 250 pupils. With the exception of a few <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> these institutions are not under state control.
<h3>Prince Edward Island</h3>

<p>The system of public schools in this province is not denominational. There are therefore no primary <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools, except seven <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> under the direction of the Sisters of the Congregation of Notre Dame, All the schools have been under the immediate control of the State since 1877 and are strictly neutral, or non-sectarian. Besides the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, which teach about one thousand girls, there is a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> college for boys, which accommodates about one hundred and fifty. Nearly all the pupils of this college are boarders, and their <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> costs them about $150 each, while, of the thousand girls in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, there are barely one hundred boarders, whose <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> costs each about $60. The Government pays $720 to the Sisters who teach the provincial normal school conformably to the programme of studies prescribed by the Department of Education. The other 900 girls who attend the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> schools receive their <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> for a nominal payment. The majority pay nothing. Generally speaking, the expense of heating the schools is borne by the respective <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in which the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> are situated, and, in return the day-scholars living in the vicinity of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> are <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> gratuitously. Until 1850 there were very few schools among the Acadians. In each <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> there were two men who taught reading, writing, and arithmetic.
<h3>Manitoba</h3>

<p>The first French schools in this province were established in 1818 on the arrival of the Rev. Norbert Provencher, afterwards Bishop Provencher, and the Rev. Nicholas Dumoulin. Bishop Provencher opened his first school at St. Boniface, and Father Dumoulin opened his at Pembina. As the population increased, the schools multiplied. In 1835, notwithstanding that the population was very limited, there were already five schools. After many efforts Bishop Provencher succeeded in founding a school at Red River for young girls, and the first teacher was Ang&eacute;lique Nolin (Metis). In 1844 the Gray Nuns of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, at the earnest request of Bishop Provencher, came to the West. Those who arrived first were Sisters Lagrave, Lafrance, Valade, Coutl&eacute;e. The first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> founded by them was at St. Boniface, and the second at St. Fran&ccedil;ois-Xavier. In 1835 Bishop Provencher got an English teacher for his boys' school. This school in time became St. Boniface's College. At Pembina Father Dumoulin was occupied in preparing young men for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and in 1821 he had six students in Latin. The primary schools increased rapidly. Every place where a spire indicated a house of worship a school sprang up. Soon, unfortunately, a crisis came, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were severely tried.

<p>At the present time (1912), in virtue of the British North American Act, each province has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to adopt the system of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> that best suits its particular needs. It must, however, respect the privileges or <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> already guaranteed to the divers groups or sections having separate schools. Accordingly, when <a href="../cathen/09602a.htm">Manitoba</a> asked, in 1870, to become a unit of the confederation, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> deputies, under the clear-sighted direction of <a href="../cathen/14427c.htm">Bishop Tach&eacute;</a>, demanded a formal law covering the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> already acquired. In 1890, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were, unfortunately, the victims of a legal <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> which embittered the last years of <a href="../cathen/14427c.htm">Bishop Tach&eacute;</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> majority of that province should have treated the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> minority with as much generosity as the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> majority, in the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>, treated the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> minority. Such, however, was not the case. The schools were secularized, and the teaching of French was discontinued. Protestations were made, and the grievances were laid before the British Throne, which recognized the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Archbishop Langevin, of St. Boniface, vigorously defended the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but no <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> was done him. The compromise of 1896 was voted: this act embodied the principle of the "neutral schools" system, and, although diminishing the bad effects of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, it deserved to be styled, by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, a law "defective, imperfect, insufficient" (manca est, non idonea, non apta). It is thus that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Winnipeg and of Brandon are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to pay double school tax. The public school is a school to which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> cannot send their children. They are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to open <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools at their own expense, while paying their share of taxes to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> schools. Nevertheless, in those places where <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are grouped in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, in the country or at St. Boniface, in the municipalities having a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> majority, they can elect <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> trustees who protect their co-religionists. In this way they can secure the government grant for the schools attended by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children. Thanks to the vigilance of the valiant Archbishop Langevin of St. Boniface, two <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> inspectors have been appointed for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools. These schools are 190 in number, with an attendance of over 7000 pupils. It is to be remarked, however, that it is with much difficulty that religious teaching is tolerated during class hours. Besides, the schoolbooks are not <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests are not sufficiently safeguarded. There is one <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> normal (French and English) school at St. Boniface, and another (English and Polish) at Winnipeg.

<p>The teaching congregations are numerous. The <a href="../cathen/08054a.htm">Institute of Mary</a>, from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, has schools at Winnipeg and St. Boniface. The Clerics of St. Viateur have an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> for boys at Makinac. The <a href="../cathen/04539b.htm">Brothers of the Cross of Jesus</a>, from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, have two schools in the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> at St. John Baptist and at St. Pierre Jolys. The <a href="../cathen/10678a.htm">Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary</a>, of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, have six <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> or schools in the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, St. John Baptist, St. Agathe, St. Pierre, St. Boniface. St. Mary's Academy, Winnipeg is for English-speaking girls. The Sisters of the Five Wounds have four <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of Notre Dame de Lourdes, St. Claude, St. Leo, and St. Alphonse. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Sisters, from <a href="../cathen/05188c.htm">Duluth </a>, <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>, have two schools at Winnipeg, one English and German, the other English and Polish. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Missionary Sisters of Mary from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> have two schools among French and English-speaking whites at <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> and a school for the Indians at Pine Creek. We must not forget to mention the Little <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servants of Mary</a> Immaculate of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Rite, the <a href="../cathen/16030b.htm">Daughters of the Cross</a>, and the Oblate Missionaries of the Sacred Heart of Mary Immaculate who are entirely <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth. The Classical College of St. Boniface, founded by Bishop Provencher, was at first directed by <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, then by the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>, afterwards by the Oblate Fathers. In 1885 it was confided to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>, who have organized a course of studies to the satisfaction of the two principal nationalities whose children, to the number of 300, attend the college. There are a French section and an English section, with a regular Classical course having Latin and Greek for its basis. Each year its students succeed admirably in competition with those of other colleges in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> examinations. The non-Catholic colleges are St. John's (<a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a>), Manitoba College (Presbyterian), and the Wesley College (Methodist). There are 300 pupils attending St. Boniface College.

<p>In 1909 Archbishop Langevin founded a <em>petit s&eacute;minaire</em> which he confided to <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. The Rev. Father Joubert was the first director. There are at present 54 candidates preparing for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. A glance at the numerous nationalities represented at the preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> suggests some <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the cosmopolitan character of the vast regions of the great West. At the same time it gives a faint <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the episcopal solicitude in providing for each nationality missionaries of their own blood and language. In this <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> there are 30 French-speaking, 10 <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, 6 <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, and 8 Germans. In 1905 the Holy Family Juniorate was founded by the Oblate Fathers at St. Boniface.
<h3>Saskatchewan and Alberta</h3>

<p>The work begun by Bishop Provencher has kept pace with the increase of the population. The Gray Nuns became missionaries among the Indians. They founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/13482b.htm">Alberta</a> and a school at Crosse Island. Their first attempt in establishing a school was at St. Ann, but in this they were unsuccessful.

<p>In 1870 the Federal Parliament voted a law of administration for the Territories. However, it was only in 1875 that they received a rudimentary form of government under the North-west Territories Act. According to that Act the people could establish "such schools as they think fit". The principle of separate schools was therein recognized. It would be too long to give the history of the school legislation of these territories up to the constitution of the two new provinces of <a href="../cathen/13482b.htm">Saskatchewan and Alberta</a> in 1905. At all events the new constitution should have safeguarded one essential, giving to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to organize everywhere separate schools truly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to their share of the government grant. Unfortunately such was not the case. Notwithstanding the agreement of 1870, and notwithstanding even the British North America Act, which the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> cannot modify, the system of neutral schools was imposed on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. It is not the half-hour of religious teaching that makes a school really <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>: it is essential that there should be <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> books, explained by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers, in a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> atmosphere. But nothing of all this was granted. However, the government is equitably administered in those districts where the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are in a majority. Thirty-one such districts appear in the last Report of the Minister of Education for the Province of Saskatchewan (page 14). These schools are public schools in which religion may be taught at stated hours. The right, therefore, to organize separate schools for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> is limited to the districts where they are in the minority (there are twelve <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> separate-school districts in the same Province of Saskatchewan).

<p>It would be somewhat difficult to determine the number of pupils attending the schools in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> public-school districts or in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> separate-school districts. The <a href="../cathen/12427b.htm">Diocese of Prince Albert</a>, which comprises all that part of the Province of Saskatchewan, has 54 academies and schools attended by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children. (These schools are not really <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. They are neutral schools attended by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children and endowed with a government grant.) These children number in all about 3000. The southern part of the province is in the new <a href="../cathen/12718a.htm">Diocese of Regina</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12718a.htm">Regina</a> was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 5 November, 1911. There are a great number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools in that flourishing part which is found in the Archdiocese of St. Boniface. The Sisters of Notre Dame of the Cross of Maurianais, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, have here two schools, one at Forget, and the other at <a href="../cathen/07507a.htm">St. Hubert</a>, The <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of St. Hyacinthe have a school for Indians at Lake Croche. The Sisters of Notre Dame of the Missions, from <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, direct three <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>: a boarding-school for English-speaking girls, at <a href="../cathen/12718a.htm">Regina</a>, and two others in the French-speaking centres at Lebret and at Wolseley. The Oblate Missionaries of the Sacred Heart and of Mary Immaculate direct a school for Indians at Fort Pelley. The industrial school at Qu' Appelle has 242 Indians, under the Sisters of Charity.

<p>The Diocese of <a href="../cathen/01261b.htm">St. Albert</a> comprises all the southern part of the Province of Alberta and a part of the Province of Saskatchewan. It has an industrial school, 14 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, 8 boarding-schools for Indians. The pupils in the schools of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> school districts number about 3700. We find here again the Sisters whose mother-house is in Quebec: <a href="../cathen/02006a.htm">Sisters of the Assumption</a>, Gray Nuns of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, Sisters of <a href="../cathen/11069a.htm">Nicolet</a>, Gray Sisters of <a href="../cathen/11069a.htm">Nicolet</a>, etc. There are also the Polish Sisters of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Rite. The <em>petit s&eacute;minaire</em> of <a href="../cathen/01261b.htm">St. Albert</a> was founded by Bishop Grandin in 1900. Father Cullerier O.M.I., was its first director, but the Oblate Fathers have now given up the institution and the Missionaries of Chavagnes, or Sons of Mary Immaculate, direct it at present (1911). There are 33 pupils in attendance. The Oblate Fathers have opened a juniorate at Strathcona, where they have 14 pupils.
<h3>British Columbia</h3>

<p>This province entered the Confederation in 1871. In it there is not one <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> school in receipt of a government grant. The different <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> bear the expense of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15267b.htm">Archdiocese of Vancouver</a> has eight industrial schools for Indians, with an attendance of 513 pupils; four academies for young girls; seven <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> schools, with a total attendance of 729 girls. New Westminster possesses an excellent institution of learning, Saint Louis College, under the direction of the Oblate Fathers. In the <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Diocese of Victoria</a>, which comprises Vancouver and the adjacent island, there are two academies for young girls, with an attendance of 342; nine <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> schools, with 450 pupils; two industrial schools, 110 pupils (boarders). The <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> direct a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of 50 pupils. Among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> educational institutions there are nine directed by the Sisters of St. Anne, whose mother-house is at Lachine, near <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, viz.:

<h3>Territories</h3>

<p>In the vast regions of the West outside of the provinces regularly constituted, there are large territories where missionaries are engaged in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> work, under the guidance of vicars-Apostolic; and wherever a church is built, a school adjoins it. There are six <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in the Vicariate of Athabaska.

<p>The Gray Nuns have a boarding-school for <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indians</a> at Lake Laplonge in the <a href="../cathen/16049a.htm">Vicariate of Keewatin</a>. At Cross Lake, 4 Oblate Sisters of Mary Immaculate carry on a boarding-school for Indians, in which there are 20 pupils. In the <a href="../cathen/09504a.htm">Vicariate of Mackenzie</a> there are, at Great Slave Lake, 7 Gray Nuns at the head of a school of 45 pupils. At Providence 13 sisters give instruction to 75 pupils. At Yukon there are 9 schools, and at Dawson 3 Sisters of St. Anne from Lachine, near <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, teaching 65 pupils.
<h3>Newfoundland</h3>

<p>Although the Province of Newfoundland does not form a part of the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> Confederation, it should be mentioned here. In each <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> there is a school under the care of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and supported by a government grant. The principal teaching congregations are <a href="../cathen/03710b.htm">Irish Christian Brothers</a>, <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, and Presentation Nuns.
<h2>England</h2>

<p>It was the common <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> until quite recently that the grammar schools of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, that is the main part of the machinery of English middle-class <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, were the offspring of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, and owed their origin to the reign of Edward VI. This legend is now exploded. A.F. Leach begins his masterly work, "English Schools at the Reformation" (London, 1896), with the sentence: "Never was a great reputation more easily gained and less deserved than that of King Edward VI as a Founder of Schools", The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is that the few <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> foundations made by the Government either of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> or Edward VI were but re-foundations forming a small salvage from the wreck of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> endowments confiscated with the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and chantries. In fact <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was singularly well provided with schools previous to <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>. Among them were the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> schools, collegiate grammar schools, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> schools, guild schools, and perhaps most numerous of all, <a href="../cathen/03573c.htm">chantry</a> schools. For the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of teaching a school was frequently combined with the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of singing Mass for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> founder. The great majority of these were termed "grammar schools". They usually taught reading, writing, and Latin. Many reached a good standard and included rhetoric and dialectic in their curriculum. There were also song schools of more elementary character. As most of the grammar schools taught gratuitously, a very liberal provision of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was open even to the poorer classes. Indeed <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> as a whole was on a more democratic basis, and good secondary instruction more widely diffused in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> times than in the first half the nineteenth century. "The proportion of the population which had access to Grammar Schools, and used them was much larger than now" (Leach, p. 97). Rashdall similarly concludes that "at least in the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Age</a> the smallest towns and even the larger villages possessed Schools where a boy might learn to read and acquire the first rudiments of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Latin: while, except in very remote and thinly populated regions, he would never have had to go very far from home to find a regular Grammar School ("The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages", II, 602). The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, with the confiscation and plunder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and chantries, involved the destruction of much of the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> machinery of the nation. The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> consequences are testified by Ascham, Latimer, Cranmer, and Harrison Watson.

<p>However, the old appreciation of the value of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in a short time reasserted itself. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> control of all schools, now in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, was strengthened by new legislation. The religious instruction given in the schools was that of the Established Church, and the scholars were required to participate in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and church services. The steady pressure of this machinery on the minds of the young was bound to be fatal to the old religion. During Elizabeth's long reign the great majority of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were practically compelled to send their children to the nearest grammar school, if the children were to receive any <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at all. For the better-off <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> the <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> maintained in hiding commonly also acted as tutor. But as time went on the situation grew worse. Then, in order in some degree to provide <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and also to furnish some means of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> for at least the children of the nobility and gentry who clung to the old Faith, there were founded the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> and colleges on the Continent. First among these was the English College at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, started in 1568 by Allen, afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. Its primary object was the training of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for the English mission, but it also accepted lay students. Within a few years it contained over 150 pupils. Before the year 1700 it had sent back to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> over 300 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, more than a third of whom suffered death for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> (see <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">DOUAI</a>). It endured till the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, when, as we shall see, it gave birth to the two Colleges of <a href="../cathen/15233b.htm">Ushaw</a> and Old Hall. <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and Scotch colleges were also established at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> for a similar purpose. In 1578 was founded the English College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It was designed to provide places for sixty <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students. After a very short time it was entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who managed it till the suppression of the Society in 1773. There were also founded English colleges at Valladolid in 1589, and at Seville in 1592, by Father Parsons, and at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> in 1612 by <a href="../cathen/04487a.htm">Father Creswell</a>. The English College at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> was started in 1622 by William Newman, a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a>. All these latter colleges sent many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> especially during their first decades, but as time went on, perhaps through their remoteness and the Anglo-Spanish Wars, they failed to keep up the intimate connexion with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> which was always retained between the mother-country and <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> and <a href="../cathen/11251a.htm">St. Omer</a>. The three Spanish colleges were merged into the single foundation at Valladolid in 1767.

<p>The most important college founded beyond the sea of which the primary object was the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of lay students, was the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> school begun at <a href="../cathen/11251a.htm">St. Omer</a> by Father Parsons in 1592. It had an eventful career of 200 years on the continent of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and then coming back to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> settled at <a href="../cathen/14309b.htm">Stonyhurst</a>, whence it became the progenitor of the great majority of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> schools scattered throughout the British Empire today. Starting with twenty-three boys, it had by 1603, according to the spies of the English Government, "a hundred and forty gentlemen's sons of great worship". In 1632 there were over 200 pupils, the Sons of the chief noblemen and gentry who remained loyal to the old Faith. Boys going to and returning from the college were more than once captured and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, and bills of high treason were returned, against the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of pupils there. It turned out many <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and confessors of the Faith, and indeed, during the latter part of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, past <a href="../cathen/13365c.htm">St. Omer's</a> boys scattered up and down the country formed the main part of the "old guard" of the dwindling body of the lay <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.

<p>Meantime the cruellest part of the penal code was the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> directed against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Thus in the twenty-third year of Elizabeth's reign an Act was passed forbidding the keeping or maintaining of any schoolmaster who had not a licence from the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The penalty was &pound;10 per month, with a year's <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> for the schoolmaster. This statute was strengthened by another in the first year of James I, imposing a fine of forty shillings a day. Later this was made even more stringent by the Act of Uniformity in 13 Charles II, requiring all tutors and schoolmasters, besides obtaining the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> licence, to conform to the Established Church, under penalty of three months' <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> for each offence. Concomitantly it was forbidden to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educate</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children abroad. Thus in 27 Elizabeth it was made punishable as a <em>pr&oelig;munire</em> to send aid to any foreign <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> or <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, or to any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in the same. Further in 1 James I it was enacted that the sending of a child or other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to a foreign college should entail a fine of &pound;100 and render the child incapable of inheriting real or personal <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. The severity of this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was again increased in 3 Charles I. Finally, in 1699 a clause of a cruel Act under William and Mary offered &pound;100 reward to every informer who would effect the conviction of any Popish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for keeping a school or <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educating</a> or boarding a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> youth for that purpose, the penalty being made <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> for life. Relentless <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of this kind, carried out with such rigour that the colleges of <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, <a href="../cathen/11251a.htm">St. Omer</a>, and Valladolid, between them, within a century and a half had mustered a grand roll of 250 <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, besides numberless confessors, triumphed; and by 1770 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was reduced to a scattered remnant of some 60,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> (Amherst).

<p>Occasionally, during these dark days, in lulls of the storm, or in quiet places, a small <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> school was started and struggled on with varying fortunes for a shorter or longer time. Thus, under James II (1685-8) two schools were started in the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, but perished soon afterwards. Another, begun at Twyford, near <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, about the same time, had a somewhat better fate and survived till the Stuart rising in 1745. The poet, Alexander Pope, was a pupil at this school, and the distinguished biologist, Father Turberville Needham, was an assistant master here. It had less than thirty pupils when Bishop Challoner visited it in 1741. There was also for a time about this period a small school managed by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Fathers at Edgbaston, near Birmingham. Another, known as Dame Alice School, existed for a number of years in Lancashire. But the history of each was usually much the same--a short, timid, and precarious life, some untoward accident, and the feeble institution came to an untimely end.

<p>Just, however, when the complete extinction of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> seemed at hand, the revival began. By the middle of the eighteenth century the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> commenced to abate. The old fear of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had waned. Toleration for other forms of dissent had been growing. About 1750 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> began to breathe a little more freely. One evidence of this was the starting of a school at Sedgley Park, near Wolverhampton, by <a href="../cathen/03564a.htm">Bishop Challoner</a> in 1762. Yet so great was the timidity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> gentry at the time that a deputation of them waited on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to dissuade him from so daring a measure--fortunately in vain. Within six years the numbers of the school rose to a hundred boarders, and for a century it was the chief centre where the Midland <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> received their early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Previously to this, another school for small boys had been begun at Standon Lordship.

<p>The real revival of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, however, only commenced when the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colleges beyond the seas, broken up by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, ventured to return. In 1777 the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government sorely needed <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> soldiers for the American <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and in 1778 the first English <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Relief Bill repealing the most galling of the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> was passed. In 1793 the College of <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> was seized by the agents of the French Republic. After temporary <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> the professors and students came to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and were allocated at first to Old Hall, Ware, and then in part to Crook Hall, the future <a href="../cathen/15233b.htm">Ushaw</a>, near Durham. There were differences of opinion among the English <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>, some urging the continuance of the <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> community as a single college in the South of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, others advocating the claims of the North. However unpleasant at the time was the disagreement, it <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a solid gain to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. For the outcome was the starting of the two large colleges, <a href="../cathen/15233b.htm">St. Cuthbert's at Ushaw</a> and St. Edmund's at Ware, both destined to have honourable and fruitful careers and to be sources of much strength to the Faith. Each of them provides today for a community of over 300 students complete courses of humanities, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educates</a> lay as well as <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> pupils. About the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> communities, compelled to return from <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a> and from <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, for a time resided at Acton Burnell, but separated later to found Ampleforth College in Yorkshire in 1803, and Downside in 1815, two schools which continue to do increasingly valuable work for English <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. At the same time was begun, largely through the influence of certain <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> of the Cisalpine Club, but acting in co-operation with <a href="../cathen/14432a.htm">Bishop Talbot</a>, Oscott College, in the Midlands. After a successful history of three-quarters of a century as a mixed school, it was converted into a purely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> college, with courses of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. It trains the Midland <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> as well as a considerable number from other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> today.

<p>In 1794 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a>, formerly at <a href="../cathen/11251a.htm">St. Omer</a>, but subsequently transferred to <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> in 1762, and thence to <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> in 1773, migrated to Stonyhurst, in Lancashire. In addition to the large educational institution into which it developed at <a href="../cathen/14309b.htm">Stonyhurst</a> this college became the parent stock of a prolific <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Starting with twelve boys, its numbers by 1813 had risen to over two hundred and twenty. The first offshoot was Clongowes Wood College, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, in 1814, which speedily rivalled the parent school in point of numbers, and was itself the mother-house from which successful colleges were started at <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a>, and Tullabeg. Later on from this <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> centre were founded several flourishing <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> schools in <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>. In Great Britain itself from the Stonyhurst root there originated during the nineteenth century, eight other secondary schools, all designed for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>: in 1841 Mount St. Mary's College, a boarding-school in Derbyshire, now numbering over 200 pupils; in the same year <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier's</a> College, a day-school at <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, which has reached a roll of 400; in 1862, Beaumont College, near <a href="../cathen/15654a.htm">Windsor</a>, also exceeding 230 pupils; subsequently large day-colleges, at Preston, 1864, at Wimbledon and at Stamford Hill, North <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, in the last decade of the nineteenth century. St. Aloysius's day-college, <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>, which has exceeded 300 pupils, was founded in 1859; and a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> day-college has been opened at <a href="../cathen/09112a.htm">Leeds</a> early in the present century. Meantime at <a href="../cathen/14309b.htm">Stonyhurst</a> itself in addition to the school, which now numbers some 350 lay students, there has been erected St. Mary's Hall, which is a house of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies and training college for the members of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. It has been approved by the government as a recognized training college for secondary school teachers, and has some 60 <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> students. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> College of St. Beuno in North <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> was founded from Stonyhurst in 1848.

<p>Other secondary schools of note are St. Bede, <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a> and St. Cuthbert's, Newcastle-on-Tyne, managed by the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>; the Oratory School, started by <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman</a> at Edgbaston; Ratcliffe College, conducted by the <a href="../cathen/13198a.htm">Rosminian Fathers</a>; a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> College at Ramsgate, and St. George's College, Weybridge, besides general successful schools managed by the brothers. Exact statistics in regard to secondary schools are impossible, owing to the indefiniteness of this term, which in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> includes a wide variety of types and grades, from something just above the elementary school to Eton or Harrow. However, if we take the "Report of the 1910 Annual Conference of English Colleges" for our guide, we find this list includes thirty-three colleges or secondary schools for boys. All these are under the management of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or religious. There are also in the country some <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> preparatory schools for small boys and some small private institutions conducted by <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, but these above indicated form substantially the present machinery of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> secondary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of boys.

<p><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> girls' secondary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> is similarly in the hands of religious. Old English foundations returning from abroad after the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, like the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colleges, or new teaching congregations, opened <a href="../cathen/04342a.htm">convent schools</a> for primary as well as for secondary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and have multiplied rapidly. The total number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> girls' schools which may be fairly classed as secondary is, for the same reason, very difficult to determine. Over one hundred and forty are advertised in the "Catholic Directory", but many of them are very small institutions.
<h3>Relations of Catholic secondary education with the government</h3>

<p>All <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> secondary schools in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> are <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> institutions. They were founded independently of the Government. Until recent years none of them received any state support, and they were subject to no form of state inspection. Indeed secondary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, as such, did not receive any systematic support from the state in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> prior to 1902; but a large number of non-Catholic schools possessed considerable endowments, many going back to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> times. During part of the past century, secondary schools, by fulfilling certain conditions, could earn grants from the Government Department of Art and Science; and a few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools derived some small funds from this source. But in the Act of 1902, the government adopted a completely new attitude towards secondary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. It empowered local authorities, i.e., county councils and urban councils, to build new secondary schools and to take over by <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> agreement existing secondary schools and to maintain them out of local rates assisted by imperial grants. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> schools which fulfil certain regulations are enabled to share in this state aid. This Act is fraught with important consequences, as it is clear from the history of primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> that the state contribution will largely increase, and unless <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> day-schools can secure their fair share of it they will be unable to sustain the competition. Practically the grants are obtainable only by day-schools. The conditions in regard to efficiency, staff qualifications, and equipment, with liability to inspection, are stringent, but a well-managed school can already secure a good subsidy. One of our most successful <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools in 1910 thus earned between &pound;2000 and &pound;3000. But the upkeep required is correspondingly costly. Eleven <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools for boys, including four <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> day-schools, are at present approved by the Board of Education and recognized as grant-earning. Another important point is that intending elementary teachers must in the future spend at least three years in a "recognized" secondary school. The necessity of a sufficiency of such "recognized" <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools is therefore obvious. Unfortunately the government regulations at present seriously hamper the increase of such secondary denominational schools.

<p>Of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> girls' secondary schools, thirty-four are already "recognized", of which eleven belong to the Sisters of Notre Dame. In 1911 there were two <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> training colleges for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> secondary teachers, recognized and approved by Government. One is in <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, conducted by the Sisters of Notre Dame; another in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, under the Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus. There is so far one <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> training college for male secondary teachers--that at <a href="../cathen/14309b.htm">Stonyhurst</a>.
<h3>Catholic primary education</h3>

<p>Whilst a tolerable supply of secondary schools existed in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> during the eighteenth century, the primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the nation was in a most wretched condition. Previous to 1830 Government took no interest in the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the poor. In addition to the efforts of some of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and a few philanthropic <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, the chief agencies working for the building and maintenance of schools for the poor in the early part of the nineteenth century were two <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, one an <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a>, the other a Dissenting organization. The first government help to primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was given in 1833, a grant of &pound;20,000. Today it exceeds &pound;16,000,000. As the best available method of distribution, the grant was handed over to the two <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> to be spent in building schools and for other <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> purposes. It was then made annual and increased from time to time. In 1839 a further allowance was given towards the establishment of training colleges for the preparation of teachers. These colleges soon multiplied. Government inspectors were appointed, but the power of accepting or approving them was conceded to the two <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. The system was in fact frankly denominational. But down to 1850, although over &pound;600,000 had been distributed, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had not received a penny of this public money.

<p>However, during the previous sixty years, in spite of their general poverty and of the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> before 1829, the handful of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the country had striven <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of their children. As early as 1764 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> formed a small "Society for the Instruction of the Children of Catholic indigent Parents", though how much this was able to accomplish we cannot tell. At least ten <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> primary schools existed in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> prior to 1800; and probably not many more. But with the cessation of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and the beginning of the immigration from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> elementary schools began to multiply. By 1829 these had risen probably to about 60 or 70. Thenceforth progress was more rapid. In 1851, though excluded from the government grant given since 1833, there were in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> 311 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools built for the poor and mainly by the pennies of the poor. From 1851 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools received some small share of the public grants, and by 1870 the number had risen to 383.

<p>In that year Forster's Act, the first great <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> measure, was passed. It was enacted that henceforth schools should be established in every school district throughout the country. These might be either <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> schools, or Board-schools. The latter were to be provided and managed by local school boards elected for this object. They were to be built out of the local rates, and maintained out of the rates and grants from the imperial exchequer. They were to be undenominational or secular in character and exempt from all religious instruction of any definitely denominational kind. But they might retain Bible lessons and give some <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> religious instruction of an undogmatic or colourless quality (Cowper Temple Clause). Along with these Board-schools, or in place of them, were sanctioned the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> schools. These could be built by private bodies at their own expense. Ordinarily such bodies were religious organizations. For the maintenance of these schools the proprietors could obtain in aid of their own contributions the imperial grants, provided they fulfilled certain conditions of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> efficiency and admitted government inspection. Each <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> school was controlled by a small committee of managers representing the trust or body who owned the school. The school was allowed to retain the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> of the denomination to which it belonged, to appoint teachers of their creed, and to give religious instruction according to their tenets subject to a "time-table <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> clause" facilitating the absence from the religious lesson of any children whose <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> objected to their attending it.

<p>As all previous work in elementary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was due to the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> or denominational bodies, nearly all existing primary schools were <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> schools. But in response to the now much increased demand the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, like the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a>, disapproving of the secular Board-schools for their children, set themselves to the building and maintenance of additional <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> schools. By the year 1901 the total number of primary schools had risen to a little over 20,000. Of these, 5878 were Board-schools, and 14,275 were <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> schools, but as the Board-schools were stronger in the towns and larger in size, of the total attendance of 5,000,000 children nearly half went to the Board-schools. Of the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> schools the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> now owned 1056, with an attendance of nearly 400,000 children,--a magnificent increase from the 383 schools of 1870. The state contribution to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, which had been &pound;20,000 in 1833, and &pound;914,721 in 1870, had reached &pound;16,000,000 in 1901. But though the supporters of the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> schools made heroic efforts, the burden of the struggle was becoming intolerable, especially for a poorer section of the community like the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body. The cost both of building and upkeep kept constantly rising, owing to the higher standard forced by the competition of the Board-schools, which drew unlimitedly from the public rates which the supporters of the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> schools were compelled to pay in addition to their <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> contributions to their own schools. Moreover, by legislation of 1876 and 1880 attendance of children at school was made compulsory. The important statute was enacted: "It shall be the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the parent of every child to cause such child to receive efficient elementary instruction". This increased the number of school children and entailed the further statute that elementary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> should be provided gratuitously for the indigent, and ultimately resulted in legislation by which primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was made free or gratuitous for all. The annual cost of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> per child in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was: in 1860, 21s. 7d.; in 1870, 25s. 4d.; in 1880, for <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> schools, 34s. 73/34;d., for board schools, 42s.; in 1902, for <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> schools, 46s. 4d., for board schools, 60s. 9d.

<p>Such was the state of things which necessitated the Education Act of 1902. This Act abolished the school boards, transferring their functions to the general local authority--the County Council or Urban Council. It equalized the condition of Board-schools and <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> schools--henceforward termed provided and non-provided schools--in regard to maintenance by public funds, whether from local rates or imperial grants, both schools being of equally public character in regard to secular instruction. It enacted that the local authority must maintain and control all secular instruction in the public elementary schools of its district; but whereas the local authority must provide the cost of both building and upkeep of the provided schools, in the case of the non-provided (i.e. <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>) schools the building and equipment is to be at the expense of the denominational body which volunteers to set up the school. The school thus is, and remains, their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. Each school is managed by a committee of six managers who have the appointment and dismissal of the teachers. The local authority has the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of all the six managers of the provided schools, but of only two in the case of non-provided schools. The trust body which owns the school has the right of nominating four of the six. It is on this slender clause the main value of the Act from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> standpoint hinges, for it is this clause which retains the efficient control of the school for religious purposes in the hands of the denomination which built it. In the provided school religious instruction is on much the same footing as in the former Board-schools; that is, some Bible lessons and religious instruction of a non-denominational character may be given if the local authority chooses. In the non-provided school religious instruction may be given in accordance with the trust-deeds, that is with the tenets of the proprietors of the school. This is to be under the control of the managers and subject to a time-table <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> clause, and not at the charge of public moneys.

<p>For the sake of clearness, then, the present position of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> elementary school in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1912 is this: The cost of the school building and its equipment must be found by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> congregation, whilst the State through the local authority provides all working expenses for all secular instruction. Each <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> school when first built is vested in the hands of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> by carefully drawn-up trust-deeds. The committee of managers usually includes the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in charge of the mission with three of the chief <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. To these are added the two members appointed by the local authority. The right of opening new schools where needed is also secured by the Act of 1902. On the whole, therefore, the condition of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools under this Act is fairly satisfactory. The Board of Education may, however, exert unpleasant pressure by exacting regulations under the title of efficiency. Still, though burdensome, if tolerable, the sacrifice in the long run ought to make for the good of the children. More objectionable have been attempts of certain bigoted local authorities to discriminate against the non-provided schools in the scale of salaries and some other matters. However, judicial decisions tend to prevent this <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. The chief anxiety at present is the precariousness of the situation. Three Education Bills in succession have been before Parliament which sought to transfer the entire control of the school from the managers appointed by the owners of the non-provided schools to the local authority, and under the plea of abolishing religious tests for teachers aimed at rendering all schools liable to accept teachers of any religion or of none. Up to the present, each of these measures has been defeated, and largely by the resoluteness of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> minority.
<h3>Provision of Catholic teachers</h3>

<p>The method of training teachers in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> for primary schools during the last century has usually included some years of apprenticeship as monitors or pupil-teachers in the primary school during which the candidate for the teaching profession continued his or her studies, receiving at the same time a small stipend from the State. At the end of this apprenticeship the young man or woman either began with the lowest grade of assistant-teacher and worked up by concomitant private study to pass examinations leading up to a first-class certificate; or the more fortunate candidates obtained scholarships, which secured them two years in a training college approved and assisted by the Government. In recent years, however, the aim of the Board of Education has been to secure that all future teachers of primary schools shall have gone through the last three or four years of their school course in a secondary school, and shall subsequently have the advantage of a two or three years' course at a training college. The preparation of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers has followed the same lines as that of other teachers belonging to the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> division of the system. At present there are in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> five recognized <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> residential training colleges for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> primary teachers. All are managed by religious. The largest, that conducted by the Sisters of Notre Dame at <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, was opened in 1856. In 1909 there were in residence at all the five training colleges 507 <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> students. There is one residential <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> primary training college for men under <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> authorities in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. There were 114 students there in 1909. The State contributes scholarships or burses of &pound;38 per annum for each <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> student and &pound;53 for each male student at these colleges. Though the ordinary course is two years, it may be prolonged to three or even four years in the case of very promising students. As at present the total number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> elementary teachers is about 8000, to staff near 1100 schools and teach about 400,000 children, and as the insistence on training constantly increases, there is need of increased provision in this respect. One source of anxiety lies in the efforts of the Board of Education in recent years to compel the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> training-colleges, if in receipt of any grant, to admit students of all <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>. In the case of residential training colleges, this would obviously be fatal to their <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> character. The attempt has been therefore vigorously resisted and, so far, successfully. A more serious difficulty in regard to the formation of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> elementary teachers for the future, as before hinted, seems to lie in the paucity of recognized <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> secondary schools which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> boys and girls looking forward to a teaching career can attend, as such attendance for three or four years is now to become a permanent regulation of the Board of Education. Moreover the many valuable scholarships open to these and other pupils from primary schools can now be held in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> secondary schools, provided these be recognized.
<h3>Special classes of schools</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of certain other classes of children is also provided for by <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>, which are primarily due to <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> effort, and conducted by religious congregations or other charitable organizations, but frequently receive considerable state aid, subject to certain conditions. Thus there are in Great Britain: <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> certified poor-law schools, for boys, 13; for girls, 28; reformatory schools, for boys, 5; for girls, 2; industrial schools, for boys, 14; for girls, 12.

<p>The chief organizations for the safeguarding of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> interests are the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> school associations and the central <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Education Council of Great Britain. There are sixteen of the former. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or some <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> of position is usually the chairman, and the committee includes some of the most influential <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Education Council was founded by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Great Britain in 1905. It took over the functions of the old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> School Committee, which originated in 1847, and also those of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Secondary Education Council, begun in 1904. The Council consists of ninety-five members nominated in certain proportions by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> school associations, and the Conference of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colleges. The object of this Council is to look after and defend the general interests of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> both primary and secondary, and the Council is recognized by the Government as representing the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in matters of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. In fine, the conclusion presented by the history of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in Great Britain is that, in a country where the conception of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> freedom and the sense of equity prevails throughout the mass of the nation, even a small minority with a clearly just claim, however unpopular at the start, will triumph in the long run, if it insists with resolution and perseverance in its just demands.
<h2>Ireland</h2>

<p>The history of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in the period from the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> to Catholic Emancipation is to be considered rather the story of an heroic struggle than a record of a school system in any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense, and it must be gleaned from all sorts of out-of-the-way sources, for the historian of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools of that period has not yet arisen. From the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> to the Treaty of Limerick (1534-1691) records are very scanty, and though, in spite of the troubled state of the times, many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools managed to survive and to do good work, there was no such thing as an organized system of schools, nor would anything of the kind have been possible. Throughout the eighteenth century <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools were repressed by the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a>, one object of which was, according to Lecky, "to reduce the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to a condition of the most extreme and brutal <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>". The same author says: "The legislation on the subject of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> may be briefly described, for it amounted simply to universal, unqualified and unlimited proscription". Keeping a school, or teaching in any capacity, even as usher or private tutor, was a penal offence, and a reward of &pound;10 was offered for the discovery of a Popish schoolmaster. Notwithstanding the severity of these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> the managers of the Charter Schools, when seeking aid from Parliament in 1769, found it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to complain of the great number of schools "under the tuition of Popish masters" that were to be found in many parts of the country.
<h3>Proselytizing schemes</h3>

<p>The Government and the ascendancy party, while prohibiting <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, made several very ambitious though futile attempts to give a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> to the children of the poor <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> through the agency of proselytizing schools. These schemes may be mentioned here since they were meant for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, though fortunately little used by them. An Act of Parliament of the reign of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> (1537) proscribed the erection of schools in every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, but the Act remained almost a dead letter. In the reign of Elizabeth an Act was passed (1570) for the establishment of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> free schools. Some schools were founded, and in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the number was increased, but they never realized the function indicated by their name of free schools; they became in the main ordinary grammar schools for the children of well-to-do <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. A scheme of Royal free schools was initiated by James I (1608) in connexion with the plantation of Ulster. Their story differs little from that of the other proselytizing schools, but their endowments have not altogether disappeared and they were divided between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> under a scheme made by the Educational Endowments Commission of 1887. Passing over other more or less partial schemes, the Charter schools, founded in response to an appeal made by Boulter, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> (1730), demand a brief notice. Under the charter granted in 1733, a system of schools was begun which, by means of agreements secured by a combination of <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> and terror, took <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children from their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and homes and deported them to most distant parts of the country. These schools became hotbeds of shameful cruelty without a parallel in the history of public, or probably even in that of private, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in any land. Yet they were powerfully supported and received large grants from the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Parliament, but their downfall was brought about by the indignant exposure of their callous inhumanity by John Howard, the philanthropist, who took occasion to investigate their condition while he was engaged in an inquiry into the state of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a>.

<p>All these classes of schools were avowedly proselytizing, and as they were the only schools which could be openly established in the country in the eighteenth century, at any rate till towards its close, the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was confined to what could be done by the efforts of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in their own districts, and by those of the "hedge" school-master, who with great devotion sought to keep alive the lamp of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, though he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that a price was on his head as on that of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. That these efforts were numerous and active is clear from the complaint of the trustees of the Charter schools in 1769, to which reference has already been made. Moreover, in spite of the severe penalties prescribed by law, the practice of sending <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> youths to Continental countries to be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> was very common, and it appears from a return made to Parliament that, at the time of the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, there were no fewer than 478 <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students making their studies on the Continent. Towards the close of the eighteenth century the rigour with which the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> had hitherto been enforced was considerably relaxed, and the immediate result was an extraordinary growth of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools all over the country, but without any organic unity or definite system. By far the most important <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work of that period was the foundation of <a href="../cathen/10087b.htm">Maynooth College</a>.
<h3>Christian Brothers</h3>

<p>In 1802 Edmund Ignatius Rice, of Waterford, began a work for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> which has been the source of incalculable good. In that year the <a href="../cathen/03710b.htm">Irish Christian Brothers</a> were founded, and in 1820 the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> extended to them the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> by which the French Brothers were established in 1725. The <a href="../cathen/03710b.htm">Christian Schools</a> soon found their way into the chief centres of population in the southern half of the country, and at the present day they number 100 and have 29,840 pupils. All the Royal Commissions which have inquired into the condition of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> have reported in terms of enthusiastic praise on the splendid <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work done in the schools of the <a href="../cathen/03710b.htm">Christian Brothers</a>, and it is unnecessary to say that they have been a tower of strength to the cause of religion.
<h3>National schools</h3>

<p>The National schools, as they are called, were introduced in 1831, by a motion of Mr. Stanley, chief secretary for <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, to place at the disposal of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Government a grant for the purpose of providing combined literary and moral and separate religious instruction for <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> children of all <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>. The new system was at once attacked by the <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterians</a> and very soon by the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Episcopalian Protestants</a>, but at first it was in the main supported by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, though Dr. McHale, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, was a notable exception. The concessions made by the Commissioners of National Education for the purpose of placating the various <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> had the effect at last of uniting <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in opposition to the system. Apparently it was not enough that in a Board of seven commissioners only two were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; one rule after another was made of such a character as to leave no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of the very serious danger that these new government schools would prove to be simply another proselytizing agency, as was, indeed, the avowed policy of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Whately. As the outcome of prolonged and bitter <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> opposition the schools were at length made tolerable, though they retain their fundamental undenominationalism to the present day.

<h4>Outline of system</h4>

<p>The National Education system is now governed by a body of twenty commissioners appointed by the Crown, of whom ten, including the resident commissioner, are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. All the other higher offices, even inspectorships, are divided equally between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, offices being in some instances duplicated in order to preserve the balance. The form of local control of the schools that has been adopted gives to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> such measure of security as they possess. The immediate management is committed to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> appointed by the Board, and in the large majority of cases these are the local <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, amongst <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> usually the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Of a total of 8401 National Schools, 5819 are under <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> management, and of these, 5650 are under <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> and 169 under lay managers. These managers have the sole right of appointing and dismissing the teachers, but an arrangement made for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools, and sanctioned by the Synod of Maynooth, provides that in the exercise of this right the approval of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall be sought. This arrangement has been accepted by the teachers as an ample protection against the danger of arbitrary dismissal. The managers have, moreover, general authority over the schools and the teachers, but the commissioners themselves, through their inspectors, control the standard and the efficiency of the teaching, and enforce the regulations of their code. The undenominationalism of the system makes itself felt chiefly in two ways: first, in the prohibition of religious emblems even in purely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools, and, secondly, in the refusal of the commissioners to sanction the use even in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools of readers or other books containing any matter which might be considered open to objection if the schools had mixed attendance of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>.

<h4>Provision of schools</h4>

<p>School buildings may be vested in the commissioners, or in trustees, or they may be held by the managers as owners. If a school is vested in the commissioners, a course considered objectionable by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, that body provide the entire cost of erection, equipment, and maintenance. If the school is vested in trustees, the commissioners make a grant of two-thirds of the cost of building and equipment, leaving the remaining third, and the entire cost of subsequent maintenance, to be met by local contributions, for the raising of which the manager is responsible. If the unrestricted ownership of the school is retained by the manager, no contribution is made, but loans may be obtained in certain circumstances.

<h4>Catholic schools</h4>

<p>The schools of the <a href="../cathen/03710b.htm">Irish Christian Brothers</a> have refused to enter the National system, but it has been accepted by those of other brotherhoods, and by <a href="../cathen/04342a.htm">convent schools</a> generally. The number of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> National schools is 396, and the average number of children on the rolls, 111,508. Of the 8401 National schools 4391 are exclusively <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> as regards teachers and pupils, 1542 are similarly <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, and the attendance is mixed in 2461 schools, in which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> pupils are 69.7 per cent of the whole. The number of pupils in exclusively <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools is 373,613, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the schools in which the attendance is mixed, number 131,657. There are, therefore, altogether 505,270 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> pupils in the National schools out of a total roll of 704,528.

<h4>Finance</h4>

<p>The whole scheme of National <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, with the exceptions stated above in regard to building, equipment and maintenance, is financed by the Government, chiefly by an annual parliamentary vote, which in 1909-10 amounted to &pound;1,621,921. The ascertained expenditure from local sources in 1909 was &pound;141,096.

<h4>Training of teachers</h4>

<p>The supply of trained teachers is maintained by seven training colleges, of which one, for men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, directly managed by the commissioners, is forbidden to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, another, also for men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, is <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Episcopalian Protestant</a>, and two for men and three for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> training colleges are under the immediate management of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in which they are situated, two under the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, and one each under the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/05147a.htm">Down and Connor</a>, <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, and Waterford. The students in these colleges, all of which are residential, are known as King's scholars, and the colleges are supported by capitation maintenance grants paid by the commissioners.

<h4>Technical instruction</h4>

<p>Technical instruction is carried on by local committees under the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The Department was established by Act of Parliament in 1899, and has, in addition to the sums voted for special institutions such as the Royal College of Science, an annual income of &pound;197,000, of which &pound;62,000 must be devoted to technical instruction, &pound;10,000 to the development of fisheries, and the balance to agricultural instruction and development. The technical schools established under this system are undenominational, but as they are almost exclusively evening schools and are confined to technical subjects of instruction, or preparatory work connected therewith, they are freely attended by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.
<h3>Secondary schools and colleges</h3>

<p>Speaking generally, all schools of secondary standard, and colleges under <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> rank in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, are purely denominational. In the department of secondary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> received no assistance from the State until 1878, when an Act of Parliament established the Commissioners of Intermediate Education to encourage and promote secondary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> by distributing grants to schools of all <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> on the basis of an annual general examination in the subjects of secular instruction, and giving exhibitions and prizes to the most successful candidates. A further Act of Parliament, in 1900, widened the powers of the commissioners and enabled them to add inspection to the examination, which, however, must be retained. The system of inspection established under this Act has not yet got beyond the tentative stage, and cannot be really effective as long as the annual examination continues to be the basis of the distribution of grants.

<h4>Outline of system</h4>

<p>The commissioners are twelve in number, six <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and six <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and as their powers are strictly limited to subjects of secular <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, the denominationalism of the schools is in no way impaired. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> colleges, with few exceptions, accept the system and compete for their share of the grants. The great colleges and the smaller schools of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders are all within the system, as are also nearly all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> secondary schools. The <a href="../cathen/03710b.htm">Christian Brothers</a>, though refusing to enter the National system of primary schools, have freely entered the Intermediate system, and have added secondary departments to their schools, in which they accept the programme of the Intermediate Board, and submit to the examinations and inspection. The official statistics published by the Board take no account of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">religious denomination</a> of schools or pupils, but they give sufficiently detailed information about each school to make it possible to arrive at fairly exact figures. Of 344 schools, 218 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>: 128 for boys, 84 for girls, and 6 mixed. The school rolls show that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> number approximately 8,780 boys out of a total of 12,067 and 4,000 girls out of 6,428. These rolls contain the names only of those pupils who are within the limits of secondary school age and the total number of pupils in the schools is probably 25 per cent greater.

<h4>Finance</h4>

<p>The Intermediate Education Act (1878) gave the commissioners, from the funds realized by the disestablishment of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant Church</a>, &pound;1,000,000, the interest of which was at first their sole income. The Local Taxation Act (1890) increased the income of the Board by the addition of the residue of specified excise and customs <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> after certain fixed charges had been met. The amount received from this source was subject to fluctuation, but for several years it showed a downward tendency, and in 1911 the Government substituted for it a fixed annual sum of &pound;46,000, which brings the income of the Commissioners up to &pound;80,000 a year. The Government further admitted, in 1911, the claim of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Intermediate <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> to an annual parliamentary vote, and if this is made proportional to the corresponding vote in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> it should more than double the income of the Board.

<h4>Prominent schools</h4>

<p>The following list gives the names of the larger and more important <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and of the authorities conducting them.

<h3>Seminaries</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of students for the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priesthood</a> is carried on chiefly in Maynooth, which is a national <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, though many students are sent to the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Colleges in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and a large proportion of the students of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a>, Kildare, <a href="../cathen/11342b.htm">Ossory</a>, and Waterford receive their whole <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the local <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. With these exceptions, however, the local <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> confine themselves to the secondary school programme, and send their students to Maynooth or the Continent for their studies in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Each <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order makes its own provision for the training of its subjects, and candidates for the foreign missions are <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in All Hallows College, and in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> situated in Carlow, Kilkenny, Thurles, and Waterford. (See also <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">IRELAND</a>; <a href="../cathen/03710b.htm">CHRISTIAN BROTHERS OF IRELAND</a>; <a href="../cathen/01314b.htm">ALL HALLOWS COLLEGE</a>; <a href="../cathen/10087b.htm">MAYNOOTH COLLEGE</a>.)
<h2>Scotland</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> during penal times fared much as in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. By 1670 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population had dwindled to some 14,000 communicants, of whom about 2000 survived in the Lowlands (Leslie's report to <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>). Scotch colleges which sent many missionaries back to suffer for their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> had been founded at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, Paris, and Valladolid. However, in the crushed condition of the country candidates for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> became scarce. Small <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools were occasionally started in remote districts during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and struggled on for a while. Thus in 1675 two small schools existed at Glengarry and in the Island of Barra. Early in the eighteenth century a small <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was begun at Scalan in Glenlivat to be subsequently transferred after sundry vicissitudes to Aquhorties. Others were started at Samalaman and <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a>. The first really important <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> collegiate foundation in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was that at Blairs, in 1829, when the two surviving "little <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>" at Aquhorties and Lismore were united to form the new college, destined to have an honourable and fruitful career as the future <em>Alma Mater</em> of a considerable proportion of the Scottish <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Since Catholic Emancipation there has been a large immigration from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and a rapid growth within the Scottish community, so that the remnant of 1800 has risen to an estimated <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 518,000 in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> in 1910, with 554 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 238 missions. The story of the progress of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> during the past century has been much the same in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> as in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. As each little <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> congregation formed, it started a school. In spite of the stronger religious bigotry in the beginning, the increasing demand for liberty and equality for dissenters after the separation of the Free Church in 1843 helped <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> claims.

<p>However, it was the Education Act of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> of 1872 that has determined the Scotch system down to the present time. That Act, following on the line of the English Act of 1870, established, or rather in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> reformed and re-established a dual system of public schools, i.e. Board-schools, and <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> or denominational schools. Both receive considerable grants from the imperial exchequer, whilst the former enjoy rate aid. The <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> schools, built and partially maintained by private funds, retain the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> of the body which owns them. Fortunately in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> schools did not meet with the same hostility from the supporters of the public or Board-schools as they did in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The religious differences which have set the English <a href="../cathen/11095b.htm">Nonconformists</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> proprietors of the great mass of the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> schools did not exist there. As a consequence, the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> schools generally, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools in particular, received more liberal treatment and less pressure, and the intolerable burden and acute need for reform which brought about the English Education Act of 1902 did not arise. The present situation of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Education in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, as gathered from the Scotch Education Department Blue Book for 1910-11, may be thus summarized:
<h3>Catholic voluntary day schools</h3>

<p>Primary, 207; higher grade, 12. These provide places for 107,740 scholars. The average number on the registers during the past year was 92,594. The average in actual attendance, 81,980 (41,363 boys, 40,617 girls). Teaching staff: certificated teachers, male 167, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> 1306; assistant (provisonally certificated) teachers, 475. Average annual salary of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers: principal masters, &pound;148; principal mistresses, &pound;94; assistant masters, &pound;94; assistant mistresses, &pound;73. The average salaries for the public schools at the same time were: principal masters, &pound;189; mistresses, &pound;95; assistant masters, &pound;136; mistresses, &pound;81. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers thus work at a sacrifice. Total annual income of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> primary schools:--voluntary contributions in various forms, &pound;39,100; state contribution under various heads: annual grant, fee grant, grant in aid, grants for drawing, etc., about &pound;170,000. The inclusion of rent (on the basis of assessment) in the approved expenditure is permitted in Scottish <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> schools. This amounted in 1909 to &pound;36,000, or an average of &pound;164 per school. The total expenditure on <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> primary schools in 1910 was &pound;208,624, which worked out at a cost per child of &pound;2. 13s. 5d.; while the cost to the State of each child in the public schools amounted to &pound;3. 14s. 1/12;d. Moreover the public schools drew about twenty-three shillings per child from rates not available to the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> schools. Still on the whole, though the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is subject to certain financial disadvantages, it has secured freedom, and when worked in a liberal spirit the Scottish system has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> tolerable, indeed with certain further amendments helping to raise <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers' salaries to those of the public schools it would be even fair.

<p>The working conditions of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> primary schools in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> are much the same as in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The chief manager and correspondent of each <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> school is usually the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in charge of the mission, but the manager of groups of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> schools are united into small Councils or Committees in which they share common control and responsibility for certain purposes--an arrangement possessing some distinct advantages. In regard to secondary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, the better higher grade schools help towards this in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>; and there are twelve such <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> higher grade schools recognized and receiving grants. Owing to the difficulty already alluded to of defining secondary schools, it is not easy to give accurate statistics. One <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> school for boys, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> in <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>, is on the list of secondary schools recognized by the Government. The Marist Brothers also conduct a boarding college at Dumfries, St. Mungo's Academy, in <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>, and a hostel for the training of male teachers. There are two <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> colleges, Blairs and St. Peter's, New Kilpatrick; and in addition to those recognized as higher grade schools, there are probably about half a dozen academies and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> boarding schools giving secondary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. There is one large training college for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> teachers, managed by the Notre Dame Sisters, in Glasgow.
<h2>United States</h2>

<p>Out of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of approximately 14,347,027, nearly one-half of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children attending elementary schools in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> were being <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> under the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> school system in the year 1910. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools are practically impossible in most country districts, and it has been estimated that from one-fourth to one-third of the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children of school age live in country districts. In towns and cities, therefore, where alone it is possible, generally speaking, to build and maintain <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools, it may be said that all but about one-fourth to one-sixth of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population attending school is being <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> schools. The number of pupils in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> schools is also steadily increasing.

<p>This result has been achieved by a process of gradual growth, the root of it all being the firm determination of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mind to make religion a vital element in the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> child. This determination has characterized the attitude of American <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in respect to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> from the very beginning, and it has been shared alike by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. The earliest <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colonists implanted the principle of religious training in the virgin <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> soil, and every decade that has passed since then has added but a new growth or a fresh vigour to the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> mustard seed, A school appears to have been founded by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> not very long after the arrival of the first colonists, though there is some uncertainty as to the exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> and its first location. But even before the coming of the Calverts, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools existed in <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a> and Florida. By the year 1629, many schools for the natives of <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a> had been established by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, and this was eight years before the first school in the thirteen eastern colonies. The first schools within the present limits of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> were thus founded by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries. It is probable that the earliest of these mission schools in <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a> were inaugurated soon after the effective occupation of the region by Don Juan de O&ntilde;ate in 1598. In Florida, school work among the natives appears to have been begun about the same time. A classical school existed at St. Augustine as early as 1606. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> established a series of flourishing schools for the natives of Lower California, early in the eighteenth century; and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, during its last quarter, developed the singularly successful mission schools in Upper <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>. All of these schools for the natives had an industrial character. In <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> school was opened in 1722, four years after the founding of the city; and five years later a band of <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline Sisters</a> established a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and school there for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of girls. There is evidence also of the existence of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools at a very early period at St. Louis, Kaskaskia, Mackinaw, <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, and Vincennes. A college was opened by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> in 1677, and another in the city of New York, about 1684, under the administration of <a href="../cathen/05130a.htm">Governor Dongan</a>; and, when they founded <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missions in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, schools were opened in connexion with the more important <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> as a matter of course.

<p>The era of religious freedom ushered in by the Revolution resulted in the multiplication of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> educational institutions of every kind. Colleges were founded at <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown</a> and Mount St. Mary's, and plans were framed for the development of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> on a larger and more systematic scale. Fathers <a href="../cathen/02200b.htm">Badin</a> and Nerinckx in <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, and Father Richard at <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, were energetic and farseeing <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> pioneers. Religious teachers for the schools also began to appear. Alice Lalor opened a school at <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown</a> in 1799, which became the mother-house of the Visitation Sisters in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Mother Seton established her community at Emmitsburg in 1809; Father Nerinckx founded the Sisterhood of Loretto in Kentucky two years later, and about the same time Father David organized the Sisters of Charity of Kentucky. From this time until about the year 1840 there was a slow but solid <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> growth throughout the eastern half of the country, with the steady increase of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population. <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Bishop Kenrick</a> at Philadelphia, Bishop Dubois at New York, Bishop Benedict Fenwick at <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, <a href="../cathen/05470a.htm">Bishop England</a> at <a href="../cathen/03630a.htm">Charleston</a>, Bishop Dubourg in <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, and Bishops Flaget, Rosetti, Edward Fenwick, R&eacute;s&eacute;, and Brut&eacute; in the west, were unremitting in their labours in behalf of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in their respective <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>.

<p>About the year 1840 a new period of school growth began, with the inpouring of the great streams of emigration from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. During the years 1840-60 twice as many <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were organized as the number existing at the beginning of this period, and the heads appointed for these new sees were as profoundly convinced of the necessity of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools as had been the great <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the earlier periods. "The school alongside the church" was everywhere the accepted <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> maxim. The <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> were of one mind with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the matter, and the building of schools went everywhere hand in hand with the building of churches. The immigrants were poor, but they gave unstintedly of their limited means for the erection and equipment of both. The first school buildings were often of the most makeshift character, but they were gradually replaced by larger and more commodious structures. The result was that the two hundred <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> schools existing in the country in the year 1840 were multiplied several times over before the beginning of the Civil War. The problem of providing teachers for the new schools was generally solved by an appeal to the existing <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Many of these sent colonies to America, and so rapid was the growth of these colonies that their members, within a few years, outnumbered those of the teaching communities previously established in the country. Most of these new bodies, too, became independent of the parent organizations. The greater number of the teaching communities now in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> trace their American origin to the little pioneer bands that crossed the ocean to take charge of schools for the children of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and German immigrants.

<p>Towards the year 1860 the period of greatest growth in the history of the schools may be said to have ended, and the period of development begun. All through the eastern half of the country, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> school system was by this time solidly established. In the Far Western and South-western States, the work of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> growth and expansion still went on, with the opening of the country there to settlement; and great <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, like a <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Blanchet</a> in <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, an <a href="../cathen/01282a.htm">Alemany</a> in <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, a Lamy in <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a>, and a Macheboeuf in <a href="../cathen/04129a.htm">Colorado</a>, were called upon to do heroic pioneer labour in the founding of schools, like that which had been done farther East by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of an earlier period. But, by the close of the immigration period, the main lines of the vast network of schools were clearly laid down. It remained to provide for the internal development and progress of the system, and to adjust more perfectly the relations of its component elements. This has been the chief aim since the <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> in 1866. The specific purpose and results of the work that has been accomplished in this direction will be dealt with more in detail in the sections that follow.
<h3>Legislation</h3>

<p>At the First <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> in 1829, it was declared by the assembled Fathers to be "absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that schools should be established, in which the young may be taught the principles of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and morality, while being instructed in letters". This was the first authoritative declaration of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> on the subject of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools, and the decrees of subsequent councils have but reiterated, amplified, or given more precise practical effect to, the general law thus laid down. The First Plenary Council of Baitimore, held in 1852, exhorted the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> "to see that schools be established in connexion with all the churches of their dioceses", and, if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, to provide for the support of the school from the revenues of the church to which the school was attached. Several of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the West urged even stricter legislation, and at the Second <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, six years later, these views were embodied in a formal <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> did little more than ratify the decrees of previous councils. In 1875, however, the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a> issued an "Instruction to the Bishops of the United States concerning the Public Schools", in which it was pointed out that the public schools as conducted involved grave danger to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children, and that consequently both the natural and the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> forbade the attendance of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children at such schools, unless the proximate danger could be removed. At the same time, the Sacred Congregation admitted the possible existence of causes which would excuse <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> in the matter, and it was left to the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and judgement of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to decide in each case. This "Instruction" led up to the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> legislation of the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> in 1884. The need was generally felt by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> for more precise and specific legislation in reference to the schools, both <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> and public. In some <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, it meant exclusion from the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> for <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to send their children to the public schools; in others, it appeared to be made a matter of little or no account. The legislation enacted by the Council fully answered the general expectation. It defined the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> imposed by the moral law upon <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> in the matter of the religious <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of their children. It provided for the case in which children were practically compelled by circumstances to attend the public schools. At the same time, it sought to give more specific application to its own legislation as well as that of previous Councils by the following <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>:-- <ul><li>(1) "Near each church, a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> school if it does not yet exist, is to be erected within two years from the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of this Council, and is to be maintained <em>in perpetuum,</em> unless the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, on account of grave difficulties, judge that a postponement be allowed." <li>(2) "A <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who, by his grave negligence, prevents the erection of a school within this time or its maintenance, or who, after repeated admonitions of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, does not attend to the matter, deserves removal from that church." <li>(3) "A mission or a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> which so neglects to assist a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in erecting or maintaining a school, that by reason of this supine negligence the school is rendered impossible, should be reprehended by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and, by the most efficacious and prudent means possible, induced to contribute the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> support." <li>(4) "All <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> are bound to send their children to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> schools, unless either at home or in other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools they may sufficiently and evidently provide for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of their children, or unless it be lawful to send them to other schools on account of a sufficient cause, approved by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and with opportune cautions and remedies. As to what is a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> school, it is left to the judgment of the Ordinary to define".</ul>

<p>Other decrees of the Council dealt with the question of the improvement of the schools. The more important of these will be referred to in the course of this article.
<h3>Attendance</h3>

<p>The total number of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> schools in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> according to the "Catholic Directory" of 1910, was 4845, with an attendance of 1,237,251. The total number of pupils in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> educational institutions of all kinds the same year, including colleges, academies, industrial, reformatory, and eleemosynary schools, was 1,450,488.
<h3>Teachers</h3>

<p>On the basis of an average of forty pupils to a teacher, the above figures imply that there are about 31,000 teachers engaged in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> schools of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Fully nine-tenths of these belong to religious institutes. The proportion of lay teachers to religious varies greatly with locality. In certain districts the lay teachers are very numerous; in most of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, however, they constitute but a small fraction of the whole number. The number of male teachers is also relatively small, amounting to not more than one-fifteenth of the total. The religious teachers are divided among two hundred and seventy-five distinct teaching bodies, including independent <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> as well as congregations or orders. There are eleven teaching brotherhoods. Many of the religious organizations have less than one hundred members, others have several thousand. The largest, the School Sisters of Notre Dame, has nearly four thousand religious. The work of some is limited to a single diocese, while others have schools and branch establishments scattered through a large number of states. As a rule, the teaching orders have extended their work wherever opportunity offered, regardless of state or <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> boundaries. The result of this has been to make <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> school <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> remarkably homogeneous, as compared with the public school system.

<p>Many of these teaching bodies, although at present entirely independent of each other, have sprung from a common parent organization. Thus, there are twenty-four independent establishments of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Sisters, twenty of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, twenty-two of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, twenty-two of the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, forty-six of the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, eighteen of the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, and twenty of the Visitation Sisters. The mother-houses or central establishments of these communities are generally located in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Religious communities in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> have responded generously to the demand for teachers in the States, especially in New England, where the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French-Canadian</a> immigration has been so large, and eighteen of the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> teaching congregations now have branch establishments in this country. Eleven communities look to mother-houses in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Besides these, seven communities have their mother-houses in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, six in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, four in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and one each in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.

<p>Candidates for admission to the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> are required to spend at least one year in the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. In the case of the teaching orders, the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> may be regarded as a normal school in which pedagogical training goes hand in hand with instruction in the principles of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. Before entrance into the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, the candidate has to pass through a preliminary course of instruction in the secular branches, and this course covers not less than two years. The rules of all the teaching orders thus provide for a normal training lasting for at least three years. Previous to the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>, however, owing to the demand for teachers, the pre-novitiate course was frequently abbreviated, and sometimes even omitted altogether. The consequence was that teachers were often insufficiently trained for their work, and the instruction in the schools suffered accordingly. The legislation of the Third Plenary Council went far towards remedying this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, by providing that regular normal schools should be established by the communities where they did not already exist, and that candidates should be allowed to remain in these schools until they had satisfactorily completed the prescribed work:--

<p>"In order that there may be always ready a sufficient number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers, each thoroughly equipped for the holy and sublime work of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth, we would have the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> concerned confer with the superiors of congregations dedicated to the work of teaching in the schools, either directly on their own authority or, if need be, invoking the authority of the Sacred Congregation, for the establishment of normal schools where they do not yet exist and there is need for them. These are to be in suitable establishments, in which the young may be trained by skilful and capable teachers, during a sufficient period of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> and with a truly religious diligence, in the various studies and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, in method and pedagogy, and other branches pertaining to a sound training for teaching".

<p>In order to give effect to this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a>, the Council decreed the establishment of school boards in each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> for the examination of teachers, and made it unlawful to engage a teacher for a school who had not obtained a diploma from the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> examiners:--

<p>"Within a year from the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the Council, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> shall name one or more <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who are most conversant with school affairs, to constitute a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> board of examination. It shall be the office of this board to examine all teachers, whether they are religious belonging to a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> congregation or seculars, who wish to employ themselves in teaching in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> schools in the future, and, if they find them worthy, to grant a testimonial or diploma of merit. Without this no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may lawfully engage any teacher for his school, unless they have taught before the celebration of the Council. The diploma will be valid for five years. After this period, another and final examination will be required of the teachers.

<p>"Besides this board for the examination of teachers for the whole diocese, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, in accordance with the diversity of place or language, shall appoint several school boards, composed of one or several <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, to examine the schools in cities or rural districts. The <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of these boards shall be to visit and examine each school in their district once or even twice a year, and to transmit to the president of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> board, for the information and guidance of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, an accurate account of the state of the schools".

<p>Only lay teachers and religious belonging to a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> community were named as being bound by this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a>, but indirectly it affected all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers. Owing to the lack of teachers, it was frequently found difficult to enforce the requirement of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> diploma, to be gained by a formal examination. It may be said, however, that the legislation of the Council had the desired effect. All the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities now have well-equipped normal schools, and candidates, unless they come with superior qualifications, are usually required to complete the full curriculum. Summer normal schools are also conducted at the leading mother-houses, the courses lasting for a month or six weeks. In many <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, too, summer institutes are held, the religious and lay teachers of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> being assembled for the purpose during a week or two at some convenient place.
<h3>Curriculum</h3>

<p>The curriculum of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> school comprises eight elementary grades. There is a class in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> daily, and Bible history is also taught several times a week. In the singing-class, devotional <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> are used, and the school-sessions are opened and closed by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> or brief devotional exercises. Outside of these religious instructions and practices, it may be said that the curriculum of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> school does not differ much from the curriculum of the corresponding public school, except that there is a stronger tendency in the former to emphasize the importance of those branches that are commonly designated as "the Three R's". Distinctively <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> textbooks are employed quite generally, especially in the lower grades. Textbooks in common use in the public schools are, however, frequently used in the teaching of the purely secular subjects. In the matter of uniformity, some <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> have gone much farther than others. In some, a common curriculum, with fixed recitation-periods, is prescribed for the schools, together with an authorized series of textbooks; in others, a common curriculum is prescribed, but the selection of textbooks and the fixing of recitation-periods is left to the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and principals; in many others, again, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> authorities have not imposed any official standards of uniformity in these respects, except in the matter of religious instruction.
<h3>Organization and administration</h3>

<p>Three elements of authority are concerned in the conduct of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> school, the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, the superiors of the teachers, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> has, besides the financial responsibility, immediate supervision over the school with respect to the faithful and efficient fulfilment of its work, and occupies by right the position of the school principal. Practically, however, he shares the responsibility of this position with the religious superior in charge of the school. The supervision of the work of the school, in most instances, is really left largely to the immediate religious superior. The higher religious superiors, having control of the supply of teachers and of the teachers' training as well as a supervision of the teaching in a large number of schools, enjoy a practical power over their schools that is comparable in some respects with that of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, nevertheless, possesses the supreme control over all the schools of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, subject only to the regulations of the Councils and of higher authority. It is chiefly from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> that movements looking towards the betterment of the schools have come. And the trend of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> school development is strongly towards an increase of the exercise of the episcopal authority over the schools.

<p>Bishop Neumann of Philadelphia in 1852 attempted a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> organization of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools, by instituting a "Central Board of Education", to be composed of the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> and two lay delegates from each of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in Philadelphia, and to be presided over by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. But the project appears to have been in advance of the times. In 1879 Bishop Joseph Dwenger of <a href="../cathen/06150a.htm">Fort Wayne</a>, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, organized a school board, consisting of eleven members and a secretary, all being <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The board was to have control of studies and textbooks in the schools of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, to examine teachers, and to gather statistical information about the schools. The effect was seen to be so wholesome that the Fort Wayne plan was adopted by the Fourth <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> in 1882, with an additional provision for dependent local school boards in the larger places. When the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> met, two years later, it practically adopted the Cincinnati plan for all the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Although the Council speaks only of a central "board of examination", and would appear, therefore, to limit the functions of this board to the examination and approval of teachers, it was expected, nevertheless, that more ample powers would be conferred on these boards by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and this in fact was done. Bishop Gilmour's "Constitution and By-Laws for the Government of the Parochial Schools" of <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>, issued in 1887, may be taken as typical of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> legislation generally in this regard. According to this "Constitution" the central board was to be made up of seven members, who were to be examiners of teachers as well as inspectors of schools in their respective districts. The board was vested with full control over the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> schools, under the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Local boards were also instituted, to consist of three, five, or seven members, who were to visit and examine each school within their respective localities at least once a year.

<p>The board system represented an important advance in the work of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> school organization, and had everywhere a quickening effect. It soon became evident, however, that the system was still far from perfect. The men selected to serve on the boards, while devoted to the interests of the schools, were too busily engaged with other <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> to give more than a small share of their time to the work. Besides this, few if any of them had had any formal pedagogical training. There was need, it was seen, of an executive officer of the central Board who should be specially qualified for the work of inspection and supervision, and who should devoted his entire time to this task. The New York school board took the lead in the matter, and in the year 1888 appointed the Rev. William J. Degnan as inspector of schools. He was succeeded in the office the following year by the Rev. Michael J. Considine, who served in this capacity until the year 1900. The title of inspector was changed to that of superintendent. The <a href="../cathen/11249b.htm">Diocese of Omaha</a> adopted the plan in 1891. The Rev. John W. Shanahan, later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07143a.htm">Harrisburg</a>, was appointed superintendent of schools for the <a href="../cathen/11793b.htm">Archdiocese of Philadelphia</a> in 1894. Soon he added a new and important feature to the system; this was the appointment, for each teaching order in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, of a community inspector of schools, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> being that the recommendations of the superintendent in regard to the teachers and teaching would be more easily made as well as more effectively carried out through the co-operation of competent authorized representatives of the respective teaching bodies. The system of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> organization, as thus developed, consisted of a central board, with a superintendent of schools, and a board of community inspectors acting in conjunction with the superintendent in the inspection of schools and in the carrying out of the regulations of the board. In this form, the system has heen adopted by other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and is gradually replacing the older or simple "board" system. Sixteen <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> have at present introduced the "superintendent" system, while thirty-seven still adhere to the original "board" plan.
<h3>Financial support</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> schools are either "free" or "pay" schools. The latter are supported by the tuition fees of the pupils, paid to the head of the school. Free schools are usually supported by the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> treasury, although here and there schools are found whose expenses have been provided for, in whole or in part, by the endowment of some generous individual. The general tendency is towards free schools, and even where tuition fees are relied on, it is usually <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> to provide for part of the school's expense. Teachers generally receive from $200 to $300 per year if members of a sisterhood, and from $300 to $400 per year if members of a brotherhood. In several <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> the salaries are higher than this, and within recent years a movement for the increase of teachers' salaries has been gaining ground. Lay teachers employed in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> schools receive but little more than religious. Generally speaking, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers' salaries are less than one-half as much as the salaries of corresponding teachers in the public schools, and the actual cost of schooling under the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> system is only about one-third of what it is under the public school system. It has been estimated that the average annual per capita cost of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> school <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> is $8. This would mean that the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the 1,237,251 pupils in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> schools during the year 1909-10 cost approximately, for that year, $9,898,008. The <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the same pupils in the public schools the same year would, according to the estimate referred to, cost approximately $30,511,010; and if the annual interest on the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> investment were added, the total would be upwards of 34,000,000 (American Eccles. Review, XLIV, 530). This is, therefore, about the amount of money that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> school system saves annually to the States.
<h3>Catholic schools and the State</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools are thus, in general, entirely supported by the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> contributions of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. For a considerable period after the Revolution, however, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools in many places were, along with the schools of other <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>, supported from the public funds. This was the case in Lowell, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, from 1835 to 1852. In the City of New York, it was also the case until the year 1824. The efforts of Bishop Hughes, in 1840 and subsequently, to restore this condition, were without the hoped-for success. Gradually, State after State framed <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> forbidding the payment of public funds to denominational schools and many States even embodied such provisions in their constitutions. Several plans for avoiding the legal barriers that were thus raised against the attainment of their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in the matter of the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of their children have been proposed and put to trial by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, with the co-operation of their fair-minded non-Catholic fellow-citizens. One of the most celebrated of these was the "Poughkeepsie Plan", which was accepted by the public school board of Poughkeepsie, New York, in 1873. Under this plan, the school board rented the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> school buildings for a nominal sum, and accepted the two <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools of the place as public schools under the common regulations framed for the public schools, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers, who were <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, continuing as before and receiving their salaries from the board. The board agreed likewise to keep the school buildings in repair. The plan proved to be mutually satisfactory, and was continued for many years. Substantially the same arrangement was made in several other places in the <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a>. The arrangement was discontinued at Poughkeepsie in 1899, only when the superintendent of public instruction intervened, and rendered a decision adverse to its constitutionality. At <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a>, in the same state, a similar decision was rendered by the superintendent in 1902, and the appeal against this to the courts resulted finally in a judgment of the supreme court of the State, which sustained the action of the superintendent.

<p>The famous "Faribault Plan" was an arrangement substantially the same as that at Poughkeepsie which Archbishop Ireland effected with the school boards of Faribault and Stillwater, in <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>, in 1891. There was considerable opposition on the part of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, however, to such arrangements, one of the chief reasons being that religious instructions, under the agreement, had to be given outside of the regular school hours. An appeal to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the Faribault case resulted in the decision "Tolerari potest", 21 April, 1892, which authorized the continuance of the arrangement under the specific circumstances. The controversy among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had the effect of concentrating public attention upon the matter, and of arousing slumbering anti-Catholic prejudice. The Paribault Plan is still in operation in some places; and in various parts of the country, especially in the west, where <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlements are numerous, there are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools which derive their support from the public school boards. But such arrangements are purely local. In certain states, recent legal decisions authorize the attendance of pupils from the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> schools at the manual training classes in the public schools.

<p>In connexion with these practical plans for the settlement of the "school question" there has been frequent discussion among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> educators and apologists as to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the State in respect to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. <a href="../cathen/03001a.htm">Dr. Brownson</a> would deny to the State the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educate</a>, in the strict and proper sense of the term, although he conceded to it the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to establish and maintain public schools. This was the view more generally held by American <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> educators. In the year 1891 the <a href="../cathen/02715b.htm">Rev. Thomas Bouquillon, D.D.</a>, professor of <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> at the Catholic University, Washington, issued a pamphlet in which he maintained that the State has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educate</a>, in the sense that it has the right of "establishing schools, appointing teachers, prescribing methods and programmes of study"; and that "<a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> belongs to men taken individually and collectively in legitimate association, to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, to the state, to the church, to all four together, and not to any one of these four factors separately". These views aroused a storm of controversy which lasted for several years, and engaged the attention not only of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> but of the whole <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world. The efforts of <a href="../cathen/13486a.htm">Cardinal Satolli</a> to settle the question by means of a series of fourteen propositions which he submitted to the board of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> at their meeting in New York, in the autumn of 1892, were futile; and the agitation subsided only when <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> addressed a letter to the American <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> through Cardinal Gibbons in May, 1893, in which, while appealing for the cessation of the controversy, he declared that the decrees of the Baltimore Councils were to be steadfastly observed in determining the attitude to be maintained by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in respect both to <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and to public schools.
<h3>Schools of foreign nationalities</h3>

<p>One of the most difficult problems that has confronted the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> has been the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the children of the immigrants arriving from foreign shores and speaking a foreign language. These immigrants were poor, and yet, if their descendants were to be saved to the Faith, it was imperative that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools and teachers should be provided for them, as well as churches. The missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who came to minister to the immigrants were, as a rule, keenly alive to the importance of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> school, and, acting in conjunction with the American <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, they have, to a great extent, overcome the difficulties that stood in the way and built up flourishing systems of schools. The chief difficulty, besides poverty of material resources, was that of the securing of competent teachers. Lay teachers were commonly employed at first. Little by little, however, religious were introduced, colonies of religious teachers being brought from abroad for this purpose, and even new <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities founded here. Some of these communities rew rapidly, and they have furnished a constantly increasing supply of teachers for these schools.

<p>The Polish schools have the largest aggregate attendance. They are scattered all over the country, but are especially numerous in the large industrial centres. There were, in 1910, 293 Polish <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with schools, having an attendance of 98,126 and with 1767 teachers, the great majority of these being religious. Next in number come the French schools, most of which belong to the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French-Canadians</a>, and are located in New England. These schools in 1910 numbered 161, with 1480 teachers, and a total attendance of 63,048. The <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, although they compare in numerical strength with the Poles and French, are far behind them in the matter of provision for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. There were but 48 Italian schools in 1910, with 271 teachers, and an attendance of 13,838. <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> schools, the same year, had an attendance of 8978; Slovak schools, 7419; and Lithuanian schools, 2104, with a corresponding number of teachers of these nationalities. There were formerly many German schools in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> but schools in German <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> now generally employ English as the medium of instruction, although German is taught also as one of the regular classes. In the case of the nationalities mentioned above, English is always a part of the curriculum of the schools, and often it is the chief medium of instruction. In Italian schools, very little time is given to the study of Italian, and the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in many of the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French-Canadian</a> schools. In schools of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> peoples, more time is given, as a rule, to the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parental</a> mother-tongue, and it is used conjointly with English as a medium of instruction. In Polish schools, from one-third to one-half of the time is most commonly devoted to the study or the use of the Polish language. Many of the States have attached to their child-labour <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> the condition that a child, even though of employment-age, shall have acquired the ability to read and write English. Legislation has had an influence in the steadily growing predominance of the English language in the schools of the foreign nationalities, but the effect is due in the main to the American life and atmosphere.
<h3>Industrial schools</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> industrial schools in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> number 117, with an attendance of probably 15,000. Many of these schools are reformatory in character, but a large number are high-grade industrial schools in charge of the teaching orders. There are also manual training classes in many schools, especially in schools for girls.
<h3>Schools for negroes and Indians</h3>

<p>There are probably near 150,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and for these there exist 119 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools, with an attendance of about 8000. Various <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities are in charge, conspicuous among which are two congregations of coloured Sisters, the Oblate Sisters of Providence, founded at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> in 1829, and which now has a membership of 146, and the Sisters of the Holy Family, of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, which was founded in 1842, and has a membership of 112. A collection is taken up annually in all the churches of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> for the mission work among the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">Negroes</a> and Indians, and many of the schools derive their support from this source.

<p>The number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indians is approximately 100,000. There are 63 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian schools, with nearly 5000 pupils. About 6000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian pupils are being <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in the government schools. 55 of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools are boarding institutions. Many of these are of an industrial character, the policy of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in respect to the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the Indians having always been to give prominence to training in the manual and industrial arts. The success of this policy has been often testified to by government inspectors of Indian schools as well as by distinguished American statesmen. A limited support is accorded to these schools by the Federal Government. Under the so-called "Peace Policy" inaugurated by President Grant in 1870, about 80,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indians passed from <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> control. Through the efforts of the Bureau of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian Missions, established some years later, together with the active efforts of members of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, a new policy was inaugurated by the Government, under which it entered into contracts with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> authorities concerned to provide for the support of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian schools. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools multiplied rapidly in consequence until, in 1896, a policy was entered upon which involved the entire discontinuance of appropriations for denominational schools. In the year 1900 appropriations ceased. To keep up the schools, an organization known as the Society for the Preservation of the Faith among Indian Children was founded, and with the contributions from this <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, together with the annual collection taken up for the purpose, and the donations of generous benefactors, many of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools were kept alive. In 1904, under the administration of President Roosevelt, through the work of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian Bureau, a considerable allowance was made to certain <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools by the Government from the Indian tribal funds, in answer to the petitions made by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indians. This policy has been continued up to the present, and in 1908 the appropriations made to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schools in this way reached the sum of $111,586.90. Prominent among the agencies which have successfully laboured in behalf of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> has been the community of <a href="../cathen/02599a.htm">Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament</a> for Indians and Coloured People, which was founded by Mother Katherine Drexel in 1889. These <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> now number 143.
<h3>Orphanages</h3>

<p>The number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>. in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in 1910 was 258: 45,343 children are cared for and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in these institutions, which are found in every <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and which are in charge of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, generally of Sisters. They are usually supported by the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> or by the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> contributions of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. A limited number are endowed. (See also <a href="../cathen/05315a.htm">EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB</a>; <a href="../cathen/05306a.htm">EDUCATION OF THE BLIND</a>.)
<h3>Secondary schools</h3>

<p>There are two classes of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> secondary schools in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> those which are intended to prepare pupils for a higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and those which are closely connected with the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> schools and aim to fit at least the greater number of their pupils for active life. The former are found both in colleges for boys and in academies for girls. The latter are sometimes an integral part of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> school system, or, again, they may be without direct connexion with the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> schools, although intended to complete and round out their work. A report made to the <a href="../cathen/05305a.htm">Catholic Educational Association</a> in 1908 showed the existence of 85 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colleges for boys, having pupils in collegiate as well as secondary courses. The number of students pursuing collegiate courses was 4232, the number in the secondary or high school departments was 10,137, There is a growing sentiment among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> college men in favour of at least a wider separation of the high school department from the college proper.

<p>In the "Catholic Directory" for 1910, 709 institutions are classed as academies for girls, with an attendance approximating 90,000. The larger number of these institutions have no collegiate departments, and are to be regarded as secondary schools. All the academies have, in fact, high school departments which are generally denominated the "academic course", with the exception of Trinity College, Washington; and nearly all have also elementary schools, divided into the "primary" and "preparatory" departments. Probably over one-half of the above total attendance is in these elementary departments. The greater part of the remaining half is in the academic or high school departments. Many of the larger institutions have developed collegiate departments that compare favourably with those of the best-equipped colleges for boys. The number of these colleges for girls as well as the number of their collegiate students is at present growing rapidly. The curriculum in the larger institutions thus consists of three main divisions, the elementary department, the academic or high school department, and the collegiate department, the latter two covering each four years. The smaller institutions have, as a rule, only the elementary and high school courses, although their high school or "academic" department is sometimes made to include a year or two of collegiate work. Besides these departments, the academies generally have well-graded and thorough courses in art and music, both vocal and instrumental, leading to corresponding honours or diplomas. The ideals of culture represented by these latter features are, in fact, a distinguishing feature of the work of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> academy, and constitute one of its strongest appeals for popular favour and support.

<p>Within the past quarter of a century, many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> secondary schools or high schools have been developed in close connexion with the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> schools. Most often these high schools are directly attached to single <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> schools. In some cases, however, they are "central" high schools, affiliated with a number of inferior schools. Sometimes, too, they stand alone, although receiving their pupils from the upper grades of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> schools. Some of those which are attached to single <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> schools have only one high school grade, but most of them have from two to four grades. The number of schools with four full grades is rapidly increasing, and there is also a notable tendency towards the establishment of central high schools. A committee of the <a href="../cathen/05305a.htm">Catholic Educational Association</a> reported, in the year 1911, the existence of 304 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> high schools for boys only or for both boys and girls, apart from the academies for girls and the preparatory departments of colleges for boys, with a total attendance of 7902 boys of high school standing and 6160 girls. About one-half of these schools have four full high school grades, and 215 of them have courses in Latin. The total number of high school teachers was 1006: 157 of the schools derive their support from tuition-fees, 164 from <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> revenues, and 5 are endowed. The investigations of the committee revealed the existence of a widespread movement for the development of facilities for secondary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in connexion with the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> school system. The movement springs from a popular demand, and is based on the fundamental <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. It is evident that the further progress of this movement is destined to have a highly important influence upon the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> schools as well as the academies and colleges.
