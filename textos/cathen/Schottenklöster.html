<h1>Schottenkl&ouml;ster</h1>  

<p>(Scotch Monasteries).

<p>A name applied to the monastic foundations of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and Scotch missionaries on the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> continent, particularly to the Scotch <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, which in the beginning of the thirteenth century were combined into one congregation whose abbot-general was the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. James at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. The first Schottenkl&ouml;ster of which we have any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was S&auml;ckingen in <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a>, founded by the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> missionary, <a href="../cathen/06303c.htm">St. Fridolin</a>, towards the end of the fifth century. The same missionary is said to have founded a Schottenkl&ouml;ster at <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>. A century later St. Columbanus arrived on the continent with twelve companions and founded Annegray, Luxeuil, and Fontaines in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Bobbio in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. During the seventh century the disciples of Columbanus and other <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and Scotch missionaries founded a long list of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in what is now <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. The best known are: St. Gall in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, Disibodenberg in the Rhine Palatinate, St. Paul's at <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>, Lure and Cusance in the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>, Beze in the <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Diocese of Langres</a>, Remiremont and Moyenmoutier in the Diocese of Toul, Fosses in the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, Mont-St-Michel at Peronne, Ebersmunster in Lower Alsace, St. Martin at Cologne. The rule of St. Columbanus, which was originally followed in most of these <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, was soon superseded by that of St. Benedict. Later <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> missionaries founded Honau in Baden (about 721), Murbach in Upper Alsace (about 727), Altomunster in Upper <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (about 749), while other <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and Scotch <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> restored St-Michel in Thi&eacute;rache (940), Walsort near Namur (945), and, at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, the Monasteries of St. Clement (about 953), St. Martin (about 980), St. Symphorian (about 990), and St. Pantal&eacute;on (1042). Towards the end of the eleventh and in the twelfth century, a number of Schottenkl&ouml;ster, intended for Scotch and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> exclusively, sprang up in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. About 1072, three Scotch <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, Marian, John, and Candidus, took up their abode at the little Church of Weih-St-Peter at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. Their number soon increased and a larger <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was built for them (about 1090) by Burgrave Otto of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> and his brother Henry. This became the famous Scotch Monastery of St. Jacob at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, the mother-house of a series of other Schottenkl&ouml;ster. It founded the Abbeys of St. Jacob at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> (about 1134), St. Aegidius at <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> (1140), St. Jacob at <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> (1142), Our Blessed Lady at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1158), St. Nicolas at Memmingen (1168), Holy Cross at <a href="../cathen/05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;tt</a> (1194), and the Priory of Kelheim (1231). These, together with the Abbey of St. Jacob at Erfurt (1036), and the Priory of Weih-St-Peter at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> formed the famous congregation of the German Schottenkl&ouml;ster which was erected by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> in 1215, with the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Jacob at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> as abbot-general. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries most of these <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were on the decline, partly for want of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotch</a> or <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, partly on account of great laxity of discipline and financial difficulties. In consequence, the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> and <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> were withdrawn from the Scotch congregation and repeopled by German <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in 1418. The Abbey of St. Jacob <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> was left without any <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> after the death of Abbot Philip in 1497. It was then repeopled by German <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and in 1506 joined the congregation of Bursfeld. In 1595, however, it was restored to the Scotch congregation and continued to be occupied by Scotch <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> until its suppression in 1803. The abbey of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> began to decline in the first half of the fifteenth century and was suppressed in 1530. That of Memmingen also disappeared during the early period of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant Reformation</a>. The Abbey of Holy Cross at <a href="../cathen/05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;tt</a> seems to have ceased early in the fourteenth century. In consequence of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant Reformation</a> in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> many Scotch <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> left their country and took refuge in the Schottenkl&ouml;ster of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> during the sixteenth century. The Scotch <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, Erfurt, and <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> again began to flourish temporarily, but all endeavors to regain the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> for <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Scotch nationality were useless. In 1692 Abbot Placidus Flemming of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> reorganized the Scotch congregation which now comprised the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, Erfurt, and <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, the only remaining Schottenkl&ouml;ster in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. He also erected a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in connection with the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. But the forced secularization of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in 1803 put an end to the Scotch <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of Erfurt and <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, leaving St. Jacob's at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> as the only surviving Schottenkl&ouml;ster in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Though since 1827 this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was again permitted to accept <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, the number of its <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> dwindled down to two capitulars in 1862. There being no hope of any increase, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> suppressed this last Schottenkl&ouml;ster in his brief of 2 September, 1862. Its revenues were distributed between the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> and the Scotch College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.
