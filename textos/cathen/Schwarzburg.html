<h1>Schwarzburg</h1>  

<p>Two small principalities of Central <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, which, however, have been connected by personal union under one sovereign since 1909.

<p>The principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt has an area of 363 square miles, and in 1910 had 100,712 inhabitants. The territory of the state consists of two non-contiguous districts, the Upper Barony in <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a> and the Lower Barony south of the Harz Mountains. The Upper Barony (capital, Rudolstadt) has an area of 280 square miles; the Lower Barony (capital, Frankenhausen) an area of 83 square miles. The Upper Barony includes the exclave of Leutenberg lying to the east. As regards religion, in 1905, of 96,835 inhabitants 95,641 were Lutherans, 994 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and 82 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> number only one per cent of the population; in 1871 they numbered only one-tenth per cent.

<p>The principality of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen has has an area of about 333 square miles, and in 1910 had 89,984 inhabitants. The territory of this state also consists of two main districts called the Lower Barony situated south of the Harz, and the Upper Barony in Thuringia south of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> city of Erfurt. The Lower Barony (capital, Sondershausen) is in area about 200 square miles, while the Upper Barony (capital, Arnstadt) has an area of about 132 square miles. In 1905 of the 85,152 inhabitants of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen 83,389 were Lutherans, 1521 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and 195 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, therefore, number nearly two per cent of the population; in 1871 they were only three-tenths per cent.

<p>The Schwarzburg principalities are a part of the region occupied by the old tribe of the Thuringians, who in the sixth century succumbed to the united attack of the German tribes of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> and Saxons. In the ninth and tenth centuries several counts became independent rulers in different parts of the Thuringian territory. Among these were the counts of Keverenburg (K&auml;fernburg), from whom sprang the princely house of Schwarzburg, which takes its name from a castle on the small Thuringian river called Schwarza. Gundar (G&uuml;nther), a son of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> king Lothair IV, is regarded as the founder of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. The first count mentioned in a document is Sizzo III (1009-60). In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> appeared the ruling lines of K&auml;fernburg, Schwarzburg, and the senior and cadet lines of Blankenburg. In 1548 G&uuml;nther XL, who was also called G&uuml;nther with the Heavy Jaw, again united all the lands of Schwarzburg under his rule. The territories were again divided by various partitions and treaties, and finally, by the <em>Hauptrezess</em> of Ilm in 1599, into the two domains and lines of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and Schwarzburg-Arnstadt (or Schwarzburg-Sondershausen). In 1710 Emperor Joseph I raised Louis Frederick I of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt to the rank of a hereditary prince of the empire. In 1713 primogeniture was introduced, and a treaty of succession was made with Schwarzburg-Sondershausen. In 1807 Louis <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> joined the Confederation of the Rhine; in 1815 Prince Frederick G&uuml;nther joined the German Confederation. In the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of 1866 between <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> the government voted against the Austrian proposal for the mobilization of the forces of the confederation against <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. Ruler and people joined the North German Confederation. Since 1871 the principality has been one of the confederated states of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. Prince G&uuml;nther Victor (b. 1852) has been the ruler since 1890.

<p>In Schwarzburg-Arnstadt the sons of Christian G&uuml;nther I founded, without prejudice to the unity of the original territory, three lines, those of Sondershausen, Arnstadt, and Ebeleben. However, the two latter lines became extinct (Arnstadt in 1669, and Ebeleben in 1681). After the death of Anthony G&uuml;nther I of the Sondershausen line his two sons divided the government between them and founded the lines of Sondershausen and Arnstadt. In 1697 the Prince of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen was made a prince of the empire, and his territory declared an independent principality of the empire; the same rank and independence of territory was conferred upon the ruler of Schwarzburg-Arnstadt in 1709. Before this they had been under the suzerainty of various German states. The house of Schwarzburg-Arnstadt became extinct in 1716. The Prince of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen became the sole ruler of the territory, which took the name of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of primogeniture had been introduced in Sondershausen in 1713, and a treaty of succession had been made with Rudolstadt. In 1806 Prince G&uuml;nther Frederick Charles secretly supported <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Napoleon, on this account, sent a French army into the territory of Schwarzburg, which plundered and devastated the country. In 1807 the prince joined the Confederation of the Rhine, and in 1815 entered the German Confederation. In 1866, in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, both prince and people were opposed to the mobilization of the forces of the confederation against <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. They declared themselves on the side of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, and the country joined the North German Confederation. In 1871 the principality became one of the confederated states of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. With the death of Prince Charles G&uuml;nther in 1909 the Sondershausen line became extinct. In virtue of the treaty of succession of 1713 the sovereignty the treaty of succession of 1713 the sovereignty went to Prince G&uuml;nther Victor of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, who since then has called himself Prince of Schwarzburg. The two principalities have not at the present time lost their constitutional independence by this personal union; however, a closer union of the two states is frequently urged. The marriage of Prince G&uuml;nther Victor of Schwarzburg being without issue, Prince Sizzo of Leutenberg has been recognized as a member of the ruling house of equal rank, and was made Prince of Schwarzburg in 1896. Prince Sizzo is the son of Prince Frederick G&uuml;nther, who died in 1867, by his morganatic marriage with the Countess von Reina, and the sovereignty of both states will devolve upon him when Prince G&uuml;nther Victor dies.

<p>Before the great religious <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of the sixteenth century the Schwarzburg domains belonged, in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters, to the <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Archdiocese of Mainz</a>. The permanent representative of the archbishop in Thuringia was an <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> who resided at Erfurt. The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> found early entrance into Schwarzburg. In the Upper Barony it was definitively introduced by Count Henry XXXII (1531-38), who was called the "Reformer". At his death the Upper Barony fell to Count G&uuml;nther XL (1526-52). At first under the pressure exerted by his <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> suzerain, the strictly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Duke George of Sace-Meissen, G&uuml;nther remained a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>; still he encouraged the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and, at the Diet of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> in 1541, went over publicly to the Protestant side. All <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life vanished completely from his territories. In the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> era the Schwarzburg territories had belonged to the Archdeanery of Jechaburg, where in 1004 a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a> Regular had been established; in 1552 the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> received a Lutheran dean, and in 1572 was secularized. Venerable architectural monuments still give <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the flourishing conditions of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life in the era before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, although a large number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> edifices were destroyed during the <a href="../cathen/11597a.htm">Peasants' War</a> in 1525. Celebrated memorials of this period are the ruins of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Paulinzella (intended both for <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>), which was established in 1106 by St. Paulina, daughter of the Thuringian Count Moricho, jointly with her son Werner, and was suppressed in 1534; further, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Our Lady at Arnstadt, the church at Stadtilm, and many village churches, which have excellent carvings from the celebrated <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of carving in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Monastery of Saalfeld.

<p>In 1771 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> services were held again in the principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt for the miners who had come from <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and had been granted the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to exercise their religion, but not in public. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> received the right of publicly exercising their religion when the principality joined the Confederation of the Rhine and later joined the German Confederation. In both principalities the periodical church services were under the care of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from Erfurt. Much of the credit for the further development of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> affairs in Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt is due to James Hermann von Bertrab, who, although a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, was the head of the Rudolstadt ministry until his death in 1887. In Schwarzburg-Sondershausen the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> was formed at Arnstadt. From 1817 the Government permitted the holding of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> services. By an edict of the sovereign of 15 April, 1837, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> was granted corporate <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. By a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> of 27 June, 1869, the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> over the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the two principalities was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>. Before this the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had exerted himself on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Schwarzburg, but lacking a canonically legal title had hesitated to introduce any regular <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> work. By an edict of the ruler of 10 Novebmber, 1871, the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> was recognized by the government in Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, and permission was given for the appointment of a permanent <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at Rudolstadt for the entire Upper Barony of Rudolstadt under the title of mission <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. By <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the ruler of 10 July, 1874, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> received the legal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of a private juridical <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. In Schwarzburg-Sondershausen the transfer of the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> was looked upon as a concession of the Government made to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the time, because the transfer was a one-sided one, made without agreement with the Government. Each new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, therefore, must notify the Government of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen of his appointment, whereupon he receives a new confirmation of his right to exercise <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>.

<p>A permanent mission <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was appointed at Arnstadt for the entire Upper Barony of Sondershausen by an edict of the ruler of 26 January, 1871. At a later date another <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> was formed at Sondershausen, where in 1896 a permanent <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was appointed for the Lower Barony of Sondershausen. Since 1900 the spiritual care of the Lower Barony of Rudolstadt has also been transferred to this <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. These <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> received legal competence by an edict of the ruler of 9 July, 1902. The legal competence of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> at Arnstadt was again confirmed by an edict of 9 February, 1905. By a law of 21 July, 1905, both <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were raised to corporations of public right. While the State gives the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communities no financial aid of any kind, Prince Charles G&uuml;nther won the gratitude of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> by his contributions to the building of churches and by promoting the interests of his <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> subjects. Notwithstanding the permanent transfer to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> the Schwarzburg territory has remained canonically a mission country. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of both divisions belong to the deanery of Erfurt. In many cases, instead of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the "ecclesiastical court" of Erfurt exercises <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, as it also does in the government district of Erfurt-Merseburg. Since 1881 there has been, with the tacit permission of the Government, a house of the <a href="../cathen/05388a.htm">Sisters of St. Elizabeth</a> (Grey Sisters) from <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a> at Rudolstadt, who work as visiting nurses. The Government does not claim the right of supervising the administration of the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a>. No <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> may be collected. In both principalities all the primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are Lutheran. There are private <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> since 1882 at Rudolstadt (62 children in 1910), since 1898 at Sondershausen (28 children in 1910), and since 1872 at Arnstadt (72 children in 1910). Neither the State nor the community gives any financial aid. In Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt children who have received Protestant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> cannot be taken as pupils in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> private <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, even if they spring from <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> or from purely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> marriages.
