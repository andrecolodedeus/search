<h1>Sch&ouml;nborn</h1>  

<p>The name of a German noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, many members of which were <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Johann Philipp von Sch&ouml;nborn</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> and Worms, b. at Eschbach in the Westerwald, 6 August, 1605; d. at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, 12 February, 1673. When sixteen years old he became a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> (an expectant for a canonicate) at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, and in 1625 at that of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. He became <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> canon at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> in 1629, and at Worms in 1630. In 1635 he was made <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of Kronberg and of St. Burkard at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>. On 16 August, 1642, he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> (<a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, 1642; <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 1645); on 18 November, 1647, he was made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and in 1663 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Worms. His foreign policy was mainly directed towards the maintenance of peace, but this policy did not always meet with approval and often failed in its object. On the other hand his administration of all domestic affairs was excellent, and as a ruler he was not below the best of his era. His contemporaries gave him the honourable titles of "The Wise", "The German Solomon", and "The Cato of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>". He succeeded in repairing the injuries inflicted upon his domains by the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a>, settled the disputes as to territory with the neighboring rulers, reorganized the higher civil service, and improved the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. To compensate for the scarcity of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and to raise the standard of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> he called to <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> the <a href="../cathen/02317a.htm">Bartholomites</a>, an institute founded by <a href="../cathen/07439b.htm">Bartholomew Holzhauser</a> (<em>Institutum clericorum saecularium in communi viventium</em>); in 1654 he transferred to them the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, and in 1660 also that of the <em>gymnasium</em> founded by him at Munnerstadt. In 1662 he established a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. Urged by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/14213b.htm">Spee</a>, he suppressed the trial of <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witches</a> in his domains, and thus contributed, as far as was in his power, to the abolition of this miserable delusion. He was surrounded at his court by a large number of distinguished men, statesmen, diplomats, scholars, and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>.

He did much for the <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Diocese of Speyer</a>, and was conspicuous for his culture, learning, and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>.
