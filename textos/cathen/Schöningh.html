<h1>Sch&ouml;ningh</h1>  

<p>The publishing house of Ferdinand Sch&ouml;ningh at <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> was founded by Ferdinand Friedrich Joseph Sch&ouml;ningh, who was born at Meppen in <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a> 16 March, 1815, and died at <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, 18 Aug., 1883. He was the son of Dr. Sch&ouml;ningh, an official of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> courts. <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">Educated</a> at the <em>gymnasium</em> of his native town, he was active in the book trade since 1831. He served an apprenticeship in <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a> and Svest, and on 12 May, 1847, he opened under great difficulties a book and art store at <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> that soon developed into a prosperous business. Sch&ouml;ningh never lost sight of a higher aim, the establishment of a publishing house; selling his store in 1875 and perceiving the need of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> newspapers and periodical literature, he founded in 1848 the weekly "Westf&auml;lisches Kirchenblatt", and in 1849 the "Westf&auml;lische Volksblatt", which was intended to instruct the people in the political and social questions of the day and to give them the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> view on these subjects. On 1 April, 1910, a publishing house was formed, the initial publication of which was the first year-book of the <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Diocese of Paderborn</a> (1849). Sch&ouml;ningh's ability and power for hard work gradually built up his business, especially as regards the publication of scientific works. The reputation of the publishing house was established and maintained in the literary and learned world by the publication of such works as the textbooks and exercise-books of Ferdinand Schultz, which passed through many editions and were translated into numerous languages; the "Bibliothek der altesten deutschen Literatur-Denkmaler" (Heliand, Beowulf, etc.), edited by Moritz Heyne, a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> professor; and excellent <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works, as that on dogmatics by Oswald, the explanation of the Catechism by <a href="../cathen/04678a.htm">Deharbe</a>, etc. The house remained loyal to these three branches of learning and constantly increased its publications in these directions. Among the periodicals published under its supervision are: "Chrysologus" (from 1860) "Blatter f&uuml;r kirchliche Wissenschaft und Praxis" (from 1867); "Gymnasium" (from 1883). Sch&ouml;ningh also did much to encourage <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> poetry; among the poets whose works he issued were those of Brill, <a href="../cathen/07240b.htm">Luise Hensel</a>, and especially of F. W. Weber. Weber's poems published by Sch&ouml;ningh include: "Dreizehnlinden", "Goliath", "Gedichte". Sch&ouml;ningh died suddenly from apoplexy. His stanch <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> opinions, sincere and honest character, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in what he produced cannot be forgotten in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>.

<p>Up to the time of the death of the founder, the house had published 673 works in 935 volumes, embracing the most varied branches of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and literature. The business has been carried on in the same spirit by Sch&ouml;ningh's sons, Ferdinand (b. 7 March, 1856), who since 1885 has had charge of the publishing department, and Joseph (b. 12 June, 1860), who since 1891 has been the business manager. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> four branches were established, namely: in 1885 the Nasse publishing house at <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>; in 1887 one at <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, combined with a store for learned antiquarian works; in 1891 one at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>; and in 1902 one at Wurzburg. The house has ever since its establishment given special attention to works in the three main divisions of learning. In the departments of scientific and practical <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and philosophy the house publishes the following periodicals: "Theologie und Glaube"; "Jahrbuch f&uuml;r Philosophie und spekulative Theologie"; "Forschungen zur christlichen Literatur und Dogmengeschichte"; "Chrysologus". For the entire field of scientific and practical pedagogies the house issued the following periodicals: "Monatschrift f&uuml;r katholische Lehrerinnen" and "Zeitschrift f&uuml;r christliche Erziehungswissenschaft"; it also gives attention to linguistics and to literature, and issued numerous works in all the other departments of learning. Among the more extensive compilations published by the firm should be mentioned the "Wissenschaftliche Handbibliothek"; 41 volumes of this work have already been issued, and of these 34 are <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> works written by distinguished German scholars, as B. Funk (<a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">Church history</a>) Gopfert (<a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>), Heiner (canon law), Pohle (dogmatics), Pruner (pastoral <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>), etc. Other publications are those of the G&ouml;rres Society: "Studien zur Geschichte und Kultur des Altertums" "Quellen und Forschungen zur Geschichte der papstlichen Hof- und Finanzverwaltung", "Publikationen der Sektion f&uuml;r Rechts- und Sozialwissenschaft". Still other works are: "Sammlung der bedeutendsten padagogischen Schriften aus alter und neuer Zeit", "Sammlung der kommentierten und der Textausgaben deutscher und auslandischer Klassiker f&uuml;r den Schulgebrauch".
