<h1>Scotism and Scotists</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Scotism</h2>

<p>This is the name given to the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> system or <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> named after <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">John Duns Scotus</a>. It developed out of the Old <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> School, to which <a href="../cathen/07161a.htm">Haymo of Faversham</a> (d. 1244), <a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a> (d. 1245), <a href="../cathen/08477b.htm">John of Rupella</a> (d. 1245), William of Melitora (d. 1260), <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a> (d. 1274), Cardinal Matthew of Aquasparta (d. 1289), <a href="../cathen/11599b.htm">John Pecham</a> (d. 1292), <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, <a href="../cathen/13045b.htm">Richard of Middletown</a> (d. about 1300), etc. belonged. This <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> had at first but few peculiarities; it followed Augustinism (<a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonism</a>), which then ruled <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, and which was adopted not only by the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Parisian</a> professors belonging to the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> (<a href="../cathen/15631c.htm">William of Auvergne</a>, <a href="../cathen/07235b.htm">Henry of Ghent</a>, etc.), but also by prominent teachers of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> (Roland of <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, Robert Fitzacker, <a href="../cathen/08644a.htm">Robert of Kilwardby</a>, etc.). These <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> and utilized freely all the writings of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, but employed the new Peripatetic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> only in part or in an uncritical fashion, and intermingled with <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> elements. <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a> and especially <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (d. 1274) introduced <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristoteleanism</a> more widely into <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>. The procedure of St. Thomas was regarded as an innovation, and called forth criticism, not only from the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, but also from the secular <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> and even many <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. At this time appeared <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>, the <em>Doctor Subtilis</em>, and found the ground already cleared for the conflict with the followers of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Aquinas</a>. He made indeed very free use of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristoteleanism</a>, much freer than his predecessors, but in its employment exercised sharp criticism, and in important points adhered to the teaching of the Older <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> School &#151; especially with regard to the plurality of forms or of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, the spiritual matter of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, etc., wherein and in other points he combatted energetically St. Thomas. The Scotism beginning with him, or what is known as the Later <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> School, is thus only a continuation or further development of the older <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, with a much wider, although not exclusive acceptance of Peripatetic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, or with the express and strict challenge of the same (e.g. the view that matter is the <em>principium individuationis</em>). Concerning the relation of these <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> to each other, or the relation of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> to <a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a> and St. Bonaventure, consult the work of the <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> Recollect, <a href="../cathen/07153a.htm">M. Hauzeur</a>.

<p>Concerning the character and teaching of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> we have already spoken in the special article, where it was stated that he has been <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> charged with Indeterminism, excessive Realism, <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>, etc. What has been there said holds good of Scotism in general, the most important doctrines of which were substantially developed by <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> himself. Little new has been added by the Scotists to the teaching of their master; for the most part, they have merely, in accordance with the different tendencies of the day, restated its fundamental position and defended it. It will be sufficient here to mention two works in which the most important peculiarities of the Scotist <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> are briefly set forth and defended &#151; Johannes de Rada, "Controversiae theol. inter S. Thom. et Scotum" (1598-); Kilian Kazenberger, "Assertiones centum ad mentem . . . Scoti" (new ed., Quaracehi, 1906). Reference may, however, be made to the influence which Scotism exercised on the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (i.e. on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>). It is especially noteworthy that none of the propositions peculiar to <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> or Scotism has been censured by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, while the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Immaculate Conception was soon accepted by all <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, orders, and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, and was raised to a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>. The definition of the Council of Vienne of 1311 that all were to be regarded as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who declared "<em>quod anima rationalis . . . non sit forma corporis humani per se et essentialiter</em>" (the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not <em>per se</em> and essentially the form of the human body), was directed, not against the Scotist <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <em>forma corporeitatis</em>, but only against the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> view of Olivius; it is even more probable that the Scotists of the day suggested the passing of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> and formulated it (see B. Jansen, loc. cit., 289 sqq., 471 sqq.). <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a> is older than <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>, but its revival in Occamism may be traced to the one-sided exaggeration of some propositions of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>. The Scotist Formalism is the direct opposite of <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a>, and the Scotists were at one with the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> in combatting the latter; Occam himself (d. about 1347) was a bitter opponent of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> defined as <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> a series of doctrines especially emphasized by the Scotists (e.g. freedom of the will, free co-operation with grace, meritoriousness of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> <em>ex opere operato</em>, the effect of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>). In other points the canons were intentionally so framed that they do not affect Scotism (e.g. that the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first man</a> was <em>constitutus</em> in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>). This was also done at the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. In the Thomistic-Molinistic controversy concerning the foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, the relation of grace to <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, the Scotists took little part. They either supported one of the parties, or took up a middle position, rejecting both the predetermination of the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> and the <em>scientia media</em> of the <a href="../cathen/10437a.htm">Molinists</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> recognizes the free future acts in His essence, and provides a free <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of His will, which does not predetermine our <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, but only accompanies it.



<p><a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> adopted a series of the Scotist propositions. Later authorities reject in part many of these propositions and partly accept them, or at least do not directly oppose them. This refers mostly to doctrines touching the deepest <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and theological questions, on which a completely certain judgment is difficult to obtain. The following are generally rejected: formalism with the <em>distinctio formalis</em>, the spiritual matter of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the view that the metaphysical essence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> consists in radical <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, that the <em>relationes trinitariae</em> are not a perfection <em>simpliciter simplex</em>; that the Holy Ghost would be a distinct Person from the Son, even though He proceeded from the Father alone; that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can <em>naturaliter</em> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <em>secreta cordium</em> (secret thoughts); that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Christ is formally holy and impeccable, not by the very fact of the <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a>, but through another <em>gratia creata</em> (the <em>visio beatifica</em>); that the merits of Christ are not <em>simpliciter et intrinsece</em>, but only <em>extrinsece</em> and <em>secundum quid</em>, <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>; that there are indifferent acts <em>in individuo</em>; that the <em>gratia sanctificans</em> and the <em>charitas habitualis</em> are the same <em>habitus</em>; that <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> is a sacrament in the strict sense; that <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">transubstantiation</a> makes the Body of Christ present <em>per modum adductionis</em>, etc. Another series of propositions was misunderstood even by Catholie <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, and then in this <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> sense rightly rejected &#151; e.g. the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <em>univocatio entis</em>, of the acceptation of the merits of Christ and man, etc. Of the propositions which have been accepted or at least favourably treated by a large number of scholars, we may mention: the Scotist view of the relation between <em>essentia</em> and <em>existentia</em>; that between <em>ens</em> and <em>nihil</em> the distance is not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> but only as great as the reality that the particular <em>ens</em> possesses; that the <em>accidens</em> as such also possesses a separate existence (e.g. the <em>accidentia</em> of <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> in the Eucharist); that not only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also man can produce an <em>esse simpliciter</em> (e.g. man by generation); <em>haecceitas</em> as the <em>principium individuationis</em>. Also many propositions from <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a>: e.g. that the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are not merely accidents even natural and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that they are not really distinct from the substance of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or from one another; that sense perception is not purely passive; that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can recognize the singular directly, not merely indirectly; that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> separated from the body forms its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from things themselves, not merely from the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> which it has acquired through life or which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> infuses into it; that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not united with the body for the purpose of acquiring <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> through the senses but for the purpose of forming with it a new species, i.e. <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; that the moral virtues are not necessarily <em>inter se connexae</em>, etc. Also many propositions concerning the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: e.g. that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can be numerically distinct from one another, and therefore several <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can belong to the same species; that it is not merely through their activity or the application of their powers that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can be in a given place; that they cannot go from place to place without having to traverse the intermediate space; that they do not acquire all natural <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from infused <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> only, but also through contemplation of things themselves; that their will must not necessarily will <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, according as it has once decided. Furthermore, that Adam in the state of innocence could <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> venially; that mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as an offence against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is not intrinsically and <em>simpliciter</em>, but only extrinsically <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>; that Christ would have become man, even if Adam had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>; that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Christ had its proper created existence; that in Christ there were two <em>filiationes</em>, or sonships, a human and a Divine; that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> have only moral <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>; that, formally and in the last analysis, heavenly happiness consists not in the <em>visio Dei</em>, but in the <em>fruitio</em>; that in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not punished with everlasting punishment; etc.

<p>Scotism thus exercised also positively a wholesome influence on the development of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>; its importance is not, as is often asserted, purely negative &#151; that is, it does not consist only in the fact that it exercised a wholesome criticism on <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> and his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and thus preserved <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> from stagnation. A comparison of the Scotist teaching with that of St. Thomas has been often attempted &#151; for example, in the abovementioned work of <a href="../cathen/07153a.htm">Hauzeur</a> at the end of the first volume; by Sarnano, "Conciliatio omnium controversiarum etc." (1589-). It may be admitted that in many cases the difference is rather in the terminology, or that a reconciliation is possible, if one emphasize certain parts of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> or St. Thomas, and pass over or tone down others. However, in not a few points the contradiction still remains. Generally speaking, Scotism found its supporters within the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>; certainly, opposition to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, i.e. to St. Thomas, made many members of the order disciples of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>. However, this does not mean that the foundation and development of Scotism is to be referred to the rivalry existing between the two orders. Even Aquinas found at first not a few opponents in his order, nor did all his fellow-Dominicans follow him in every particular (e.g. Durandus of St. Pour&ccedil;ain, d. 1332). The Scotist doctrines were also supported by many <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a>, of whose purity of purpose there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and of whom many have been included in the catalogue of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <em>beati</em> (e.g. Sts. <a href="../cathen/02505b.htm">Bernardine</a>, John Capistran, Jacob of the March, Angelus of Chiavasso, etc.). Furthermore, Scotism found not a few supporters among secular professors and in other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders (e.g. the Augustinians, <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a>, etc.), especially in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. On the other hand, not all the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a> were Scotists. Many attached themselves to St. Bonaventure, or favoured an eclecticism from <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>, St. Thomas, St. Bonaventure, etc. The <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a> seem to have adhered most faithfully to <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>, particularly at the <a href="../cathen/11387a.htm">University of Padua</a>, where many highly esteemed teachers lectured. Scotism found least support among the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, who preferred St. Bonaventure. Besides <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>, the order had other highly-prized teachers, such as <a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a>, <a href="../cathen/13045b.htm">Richard of Middleton</a>, and especially St. Bonaventure (proclaimed <em>Doctor ecclesia</em> by <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> in 1587), the ascetico-mystical trend of whose <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> was more suited to wide circles in the order than the critical, dispassionate, and often abstruse teaching of the Subtle Doctor. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> tertiary, Blessed Raymund Lullus (d. 1315), also had many friends. It may be said that the whole order as such never had a uniform and special <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Scotists; the teachers, preachers, etc. were never compelled to espouse Scotism. His disciples did indeed call <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> "<em>Doctor noster</em>", "<em>Doctor (vel Magister) Ordinis</em>", but even among these many partly followed their own course (e.g. <a href="../cathen/02111a.htm">Petrus Aureolus</a>), while Walter Burleigh (Burlaeus, d. about 1340) and still more so Occam were opponents of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>.

<p>It is only at the end of the fifteenth or the beginning of the sixteenth century that a special Scotist School can be spoken of. The works of the master were then collected, brought out in many editions, commentated, etc. Since 1501 we also find numerous regulations of general chapters recommending or directly prescribing Scotism as the teaching of the order, although St. Bonaventure's writings were also to a great extent admitted (ef. Marian Fern&aacute;ndez Garcia, "Lexicon scholasticum etc.", Quaracchi, 1910; "B. Joan. Duns Scoti: De rerum principio etc.", Quaracchi, 1910, preface article 3, nn. 46 sqq., where many regulations of 1501-1907 are given). Scotism appears to have attained its greatest popularity at the beginning of the seventeenth century; during the sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries we even find special Scotist chairs, e.g. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/04095b.htm">Coimbra</a>, Salamanca, Alcal&aacute;, <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, and Pavia. In the eighteenth century it had still an important following, but in the nineteenth it suffered a great decline. One of the reasons for this was the repeated suppressions of the order in almost every country, while the recommendation of the teaching of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> by several <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> could not be favourable to Scotism. It has even been asserted that it is now merely tolerated; but this statement is <em>a priori</em> improbable in regard to a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of which not a single proposition has been censured, and to which so many highly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> men (<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>) have belonged; and it is still less probable in view of the approval of the various general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> (repeated so often down to the present day), in which Scotism is at least recommended. In their Decrees <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> have recommended not alone St. Thomas, but also <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> in general, and this includes also the Scotist School. In 1897 <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> approved the "Constitutiones Generales Fratrum Minorum", of which article 245 prescribes for the members of the order: "In doctrinis philosophicis et theologicis antiqae scholae Franciscanae inhaerere studeant, quin tamen ceteros scholasticos negligant" (In <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> they shall take care to follow the ancient <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> School, without, however, neglecting the other <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a>.) On 11 April, 1904, in a letter to the Minister General, Father Dionysius Schuler, <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> expressed his pleasure at the revival of studies in the order in connexion with the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and on 19 June, 1908, in a letter to the abovementioned Father Marian, praised his book, "Mentis in Deum quotidiana elevatio duce B. Joanne Duns Scoto etc." (Quaracehi, 1907. See Marian, op. cit., n. 66.)

<h3>Nineteenth and twentieth centuries</h3>

<p>In the nineteenth century, although Scotism was retained in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, we meet but few tractates <em>secundum mentem Scoti</em>, in any case no celebrated ones. The twentieth century appears to promise better. Father Fern&aacute;ndez, a <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, is a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> Scotist. Beside the abovementioned writings, he has written a large "Scotus Lexicon", and is at present (1911) issuing new edition of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus's</a> "Comment. in Sentent.' Another <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> worker is Father Deodat-Marie de Basley; his fortnightly journal, "La bonne parole" (now entitled "Revue Duns Scot."), contains much Scotistica. He is also engaged on the "Capitali opera B. Joan. Duns Scoti" (Le Havre, 1908) of which the "Praeparatio philosophica" and "Synthesis theologica credendorum" have already appeared. Father Parthenius Minges has explained and defended much of the Scotist <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in his "Compend. theolog. dogmat. specialis et generalis" (Munich, 1901-02), and in a number of other works.
