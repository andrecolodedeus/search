<h1>Scoto-Hibernian Monasteries</h1>  

<p>A convenient term under which to include the monastic institutions which were founded during the sixth century in the country now known as <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, though that name was not used in its present sense until four hundred years later. These institutions owed their origin to the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and energy of St. Columba, whose labors among the Picts and Scots extended over a period of nearly forty years, and whose biographer, <a href="../cathen/01135c.htm">Adamnan</a>, the ninth <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a>, is our chief authority on the subject, although his list of Columban foundations is probably incomplete, and the exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dates</a> of their erection are uncertain. What is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, however, is that these <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">monastic houses</a> grouped themselves round <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a> as their centre, and long remained in close connection with her. Like the Columban houses in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, they acknowledged the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a> as that of their mother-house, and the communities belonging to them together formed the widespread organization known as the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a>, or <em>muinter Ioe</em>. Not all these <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were actually founded by St. Columba in person, some of them owing their origin to his immediate followers, whose names have in many cases survived the disappearance of all material traces of the establishments in question. Reeves, Skene, and other Scottish and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> antiquarians have devoted much time, labor, and research in the endeavor to identify the localities mentioned by <a href="../cathen/01135c.htm">Adamnan</a> and other early writers. With out following them into these topographical and philological details, it may be stated generally that vestiges of Columban foundations are to be found in the northern, eastern, and western districts of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, formerly occupied respectively by the Northern and Southern Picts and by the Scots of Dalriada. Many of these <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were established on the islands off the west coast, including Tiree, Skye, Garveloch, Harris, Lewis, North and South Uist, <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a>, Mull, Eigg, Canna, Colonsay, and numerous smaller islands.

<p><a href="../cathen/01135c.htm">Adamnan</a> makes no mention of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> founded by Columba and his contemporaries and followers in the Pictish territories north and east of the great central mountain-range known as Drumalban; but from other sources we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there were many of such foundations, several of them being in the remote Orkney Islands. The Book of Deer, a notable foundation in the Buchan district, records the method in which these isolated <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were established among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> tribes, the head of a tribe granting a <em>cathair</em>, or fort, which was then occupied by a colony of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> or missionaries a system of settlement in every respect similar to that prevailing in the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church at the same period. All down the east coast, as far as the Forth, we find the name of Colum, Colm or Comb constantly associated at the present day with churches, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, fairs, and wells, showing how widespread were the influence and labors of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> of <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a>. In the territory of the Southern Picts, who as a nation had been <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> a century before by <a href="../cathen/11084a.htm">St. Ninian</a>, though many of the faithful had since fallen away, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was revived, and new centres of religion and of missionary work were formed by the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> established by Columba and his friends. The monastic church of Abernethy was founded, or rather refounded, by King Gartnaidh, son and successor of Brude, Columba's own convert and warm ally. Another friend of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, Cainnech, founded the church and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Kilrimont, celebrated in after times as St. Andrews. The monastic church of <a href="../cathen/05193a.htm">Dunkeld</a>, though founded much later, at the eventful period when the Picts and Scots were united under the sceptre of Kenneth McAlpine, was essentially a Columban foundation, though by that time the influence of the venerable mother-house of <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a> had greatly waned, and the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> monastic churches had in fact been transferred to Kells in Meath.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> Dunkeld, under royal patronage, took the place of <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a> as the head of the Columban churches; and so clearly was this recognized that when the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> form of church government was established in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a> was included in the <a href="../cathen/05193a.htm">Diocese of Dunkeld</a>, and remained so long after Argyll, of which it formed a part, became the seat of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> of its own. By that time, however the Columban or monastic church, dominant in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> for nearly two centuries, had, as an organized body, decayed and disappeared. Early in the eighth century the remnant of Columban <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were expelled by King Nectan, and the primacy of <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a> came to an end. The numerous Columban <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, or at least such of them as were not abandoned and in ruins, came into the hands of the now dominant Culdees; and they in turn, when the Scottish Church came to be reorganized on the English model under the influence of St. Margaret and her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, found themselves gradually superseded by the regular monastic orders which were introduced into the country by the munificence of kings, princes, and nobles, and reared their splendid <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> on the sites of the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Columban days. One Columban house only, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/04674b.htm">Deer</a> already mentioned, which had been founded by Columba himself, and placed by him under the care of his nephew Drosden, preserved its original and Celtic character for fifty years beyond the reign of David I, who granted it a new charter, and showed it special favor. Early in the thirteenth century, however, it was extinguished like the rest, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> being made over to the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, who held it until the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The building, however, seems to have preserved something of the primitive simplicity of the Columban foundations; for one of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> is recorded to have resigned his office and returned to the stately abbey of Melrose, which he preferred to what he called that poor cottage of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Deir". Today a certain number of place-names up and down the country, the patronal <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of a certain number of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scottish</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and a few grass-covered earthen mounds or fragments of walls, are all that is left to recall the numerous houses of the <em>muintir I&aelig;</em>, the cradle of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scottish</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> thirteen centuries ago.
