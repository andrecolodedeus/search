<h1>Scripture</h1>  

<p><em><a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a></em> is one of the several names denoting the <a href="../bible/index.html">inspired writings</a> which make up the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Use of the word</h2>

<p>The corresponding Latin word <em>scriptura</em> occurs in some passages of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> in the general sense of "writing"; e.g., <a href="../bible/exo032.htm#vrs16">Exodus 32:16</a>: "the writing also of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was graven in the tables"; again, <a href="../bible/2ch036.htm#vrs22">2 Chronicles 36:22</a>: "who [Cyrus] commanded it to be proclaimed through all his kingdom, and by writing also". In other passages of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> the word denotes a private (<a href="../bible/tob008.htm#vrs24">Tobit 8:24</a>) or public (<a href="../bible/ezr002.htm#vrs62">Ezra 2:62</a>; <a href="../bible/neh007.htm#vrs64">Nehemiah 7:64</a>) written document, a catalogue or index (<a href="../bible/psa086.htm#vrs6">Psalm 86:6</a>), or finally portions of Scripture, such as the canticle of Ezechias (<a href="../bible/isa038.htm#vrs5">Isaiah 38:5</a>), and the sayings of the wise men (<a href="../bible/sir044.htm#vrs5">Sirach 44:5</a>). The writer of <a href="../bible/2ch030.htm#vrs5">2 Chronicles 30:5, 18</a>, refers to prescriptions of the Law by the formula "as it is written", which is rendered by the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> translators <em>kata ten graphen; para ten graphen</em>, "according to Scripture". The same expression is found in <a href="../bible/ezr003.htm#vrs4">Ezra 3:4</a> and <a href="../bible/neh008.htm#vrs15">Nehemiah 8:15</a>; here we have the beginning of the later form of appeal to the authority of the inspired books <em>gegraptai</em> (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#vrs4">Matthew 4:4, 6, 10</a>; <a href="../bible/mat021.htm#vrs13">21:13</a>; etc.), or <em>kathos gegraptai</em> (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#vrs11">Romans 1:11</a>; <a href="../bible/rom002.htm#vrs24">2:24</a>, etc.), "it is written", "as it is written".

<p>As the verb <em>graphein</em> was thus employed to denote passages of the sacred writings, so the corresponding noun <em>he graphe</em> gradually came to signify what is pre-eminently the writing, or the inspired writing. This use of the word may be seen in <a href="../bible/joh007.htm#vrs38">John 7:38</a> and <a href="../bible/joh010.htm#vrs35">10:35</a>; <a href="../bible/act008.htm#vrs32">Acts 8:32</a>; <a href="../bible/rom004.htm#vrs3">Romans 4:3</a> and <a href="../bible/rom009.htm#vrs17">9:17</a>; Galatians 3:8 and 4:30; <a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#vrs16">2 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="../bible/jam002.htm#vrs8">James 2:8</a>; <a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#vrs6">1 Peter 2:6</a>; <a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#vrs20">2 Peter 1:20</a>; the plural form of the noun, <em>ai graphai</em>, is used in the same sense in <a href="../bible/mat021.htm#vrs42">Matthew 21:42</a>; <a href="../bible/mat022.htm#vrs29">22:29</a>; <a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs54">26:54</a>; <a href="../bible/mar012.htm#vrs24">Mark 12:24</a>; <a href="../bible/mar014.htm#vrs49">14:49</a>; <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#vrs27">Luke 24:27, 45</a>; <a href="../bible/joh005.htm#vrs39">John 5:39</a>; <a href="../bible/act017.htm#vrs2">Acts 17:2, 17</a> and <a href="../bible/act018.htm#vrs24">18:24-28</a>; <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs3">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</a>. In a similar sense are employed the expressions <em>graphai hagiai</em> (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#vrs2">Romans 1:2</a>), <em>ai graphai ton propheton</em> (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs56">Matthew 26:56</a>), <em>graphai prophetikai</em> (<a href="../bible/rom016.htm#vrs26">Romans 16:26</a>). The word has a somewhat modified sense in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> question, "and have you not read this scripture" (<a href="../bible/mar012.htm#vrs10">Mark 12:10</a>). In the language of Christ and the Apostles the expression "scripture" or "scriptures" denotes the sacred books of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> uses the expressions in this sense about fifty times; but they occur more frequently in the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a> and the Epistles than in the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">synoptic Gospels</a>. At times, the contents of Scripture are indicated more accurately as comprising the Law and the Prophets (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#vrs21">Romans 3:21</a>; <a href="../bible/act028.htm#vrs23">Acts 28:23</a>), or the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Law of Moses</a>, the Prophets, and the Psalms (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#vrs44">Luke 24:44</a>). The Apostle St. Peter extends the designation Scripture also to <em>tas loipas graphas</em> (<a href="../bible/2pe003.htm#vrs16">2 Peter 3:16</a>), denoting the Pauline Epistles; <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#vrs18">1 Timothy 5:18</a>) seems to refer by the same expression to both <a href="../bible/deu025.htm#vrs4">Deuteronomy 25:4</a> and <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#vrs7">Luke 10:7</a>.

<p>It is disputed whether the word <em>graphe</em> in the singular is ever used of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> as a whole. Lightfoot (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#vrs22">Galatians 3:22</a>) expresses the opinion that the singular <em>graphe</em> in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> always means a particular passage of Scripture. But in <a href="../bible/rom004.htm">Romans 4:3</a>, he modifies his view, appealing to Dr. Vaughan's statement of the case. He believes that the usage of St. John may admit a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, though he does not think so, personally; but <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> practice is absolute and uniform. Mr. Hort says (<a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#vrs6">1 Peter 2:6</a>) that in St. John and St. Paul <em>he graphe</em> is capable of being understood as approximating to the collective sense (cf. Westcott, "Hebr.", pp. 474 sqq.; Deissmann, "Bibelstudien", pp. 108 sqq., Eng. tr., pp. 112 sqq., Warfield, "Pres. and Reform. Review", X, July, 1899, pp. 472 sqq.). Here arises the question whether the expression of St. Peter (<a href="../bible/2pe003.htm">2 Peter 3:16</a>) <em>tas loipas graphas</em> refers to a collection of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a>. Spitta contends that the term <em>graphai</em> is used in a general non-technical meaning, denoting only writings of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> associates (Spitta, "Der zweite Brief des Petrus und der Brief des Judas", 1885, p. 294). Zahn refers the term to writings of a <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> which could claim respect in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> circles either on account of their authors or on account of their use in public worship (Einleitung, pp. 98 sqq., 108). But Mr. F.H. Chase adheres to the principle that the phrase <em>ai graphai</em> used absolutely points to a definite and recognized collection of writings, i.e., Scriptures. The accompanying words, <em>kai</em>, <em>tas loipas</em>, and the verb <em>streblousin</em> in the context confirm Mr. Chase in his conviction (cf. Dict. of the Bible, III, p. 810b).
<h2 id="section2">Nature of Scripture</h2>
<h3 id="A">According to the Jews</h3>

<p>Whether the terms <em>graphe, graphai</em>, and their synonymous expressions <em>to biblion</em> (<a href="../bible/neh008.htm#vrs8">Nehemiah 8:8</a>), <em>ta biblia</em> (<a href="../bible/dan009.htm#vrs2">Daniel 9:2</a>), <em>kephalis bibliou</em> (<a href="../bible/psa039.htm#vrs8">Psalm 39:8</a>), <em>he iera biblos</em> (<a href="../bible/2ma008.htm#vrs23">2 Maccabees 8:23</a>), <em>ta biblia ta hagia</em> (<a href="../bible/1ma012.htm#vrs9">1 Maccabees 12:9</a>), <em>ta iera grammata</em> (<a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#vrs15">2 Timothy 3:15</a>) refer to particular writings or to a collection of books, they at least show the existence of a number of written documents the authority of which was generally accepted as supreme. The nature of this authority may be inferred from a number of other passages. According to <a href="../bible/deu031.htm#vrs9">Deuteronomy 31:9-13</a>, Moses wrote the Book of the Law (of the Lord), and delivered it to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that they might keep it and read it to the people; see also <a href="../bible/exo017.htm#vrs14">Exodus 17:14</a>; <a href="../bible/deu017.htm#vrs18">Deuteronomy 17:18-19</a>; <a href="../bible/deu027.htm#vrs1">27:1</a>; <a href="../bible/deu028.htm#vrs1">28:1</a>; <a href="../bible/deu028.htm#vrs58">58-61</a>; <a href="../bible/deu029.htm#vrs20">29:20</a>; <a href="../bible/deu030.htm#vrs10">30:10</a>; <a href="../bible/deu031.htm#vrs26">31:26</a>; <a href="../bible/1sa010.htm#vrs25">1 Samuel 10:25</a>; <a href="../bible/1ki002.htm#vrs3">1 Kings 2:3</a>; <a href="../bible/2ki022.htm#vrs8">2 Kings 22:8</a>. It is clear from <a href="../bible/2ki023.htm#vrs1">2 Kings 23:1-3</a>, that towards the end of the Jewish kingdom the Book of the Law of the Lord was held in the highest <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> as containing the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the Lord Himself. That this was also the case after the Captivity, may be inferred from II Esdr., viii, 1-9, 13,14, 18; the book here mentioned contained the injunctions concerning the <a href="../cathen/14425a.htm">Feast of Tabernacles</a> found in Lev., xxiii, 34 sq.; <a href="../bible/deu016.htm#vrs13">Deuteronomy 16:13 sq.</a>, and is therefore identical with the pre-Exilic Sacred Books. According to I Mach., i, 57-59, Antiochus commanded the Books of the Law of the Lord to be burned and their retainers to slain. We learn from II Mach., ii, 13, that at the time of Nehemias there existed a collection of books containing historical, prophetical, and psalmodic writings; since the collection is represented as uniform, and since the portions were considered as certainly of Divine authority, we may infer that this characteristic was ascribed to all, at least in some degree. Coming down to the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we find that <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Flavius Josephus</a> attributes to the twenty-two protocanonical books of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> Divine authority, maintaining that they had been written under <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">Divine inspiration</a> and that they contain <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> teachings (Contra Appion., I, vi-viii). The Hellenist Philo too is acquainted with the three parts of the sacred Jewish books to which he ascribes an irrefragable authority, because they contain <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> oracles expressed through the instrumentality of the sacred writers ("De vit. Mosis", pp. 469, 658 sq.; "De monarchia", p. 564).

<h3 id="B">According to Christian living</h3>

<p>This concept of Scripture is fully upheld by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> teaching. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> Himself appeals to the authority of Scripture, "Search the scriptures" (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#vrs39">John 5:39</a>); He maintains that "one jot, or one tittle shall not pass of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, till all be fulfilled" (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs18">Matthew 5:18</a>); He regards it as a principle that "the Scripture cannot be broken" (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#vrs35">John 10:35</a>); He presents the word of Scripture as the word of the eternal Father (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#vrs33">John 5:33-41</a>), as the word of a writer inspired by the Holy Ghost (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#vrs43">Matthew 22:43</a>), as the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#vrs4">Matthew 19:4-5</a>; <a href="../bible/mat022.htm#vrs31">22:31</a>); He declares that "all things must needs be fulfilled which are written in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and in the psalms, concerning me (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#vrs44">Luke 24:44</a>). The Apostles <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that "prophecy came not by the will of man at any time: but the holy men of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> spoke, inspired by the Holy Ghost" (<a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#vrs21">2 Peter 1:21</a>); they regarded "all scripture, inspired of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" as "profitable to teach, to reprove, to correct, to instruct in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>" (<a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#vrs16">2 Timothy 3:16</a>). They considered the words of Scripture as the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> speaking in the inspired writer or by the mouth of the inspired writer (<a href="../bible/heb004.htm#vrs7">Hebrews 4:7</a>; <a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs15">Acts 1:15-16</a>; <a href="../bible/act004.htm#vrs25">4:25</a>). Finally, they appealed to Scripture as to an irresistible authority (Rom., <em>passim</em>), they supposed that parts of Scripture have a typical sense such as only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can employ (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs36">John 19:36</a>; <a href="../bible/heb001.htm#vrs5">Hebrews 1:5</a>; <a href="../bible/heb007.htm#vrs3">7:3 sqq.</a>), and they derived most important conclusions even from a few words or certain grammatical forms of Scripture (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#vrs16">Galatians 3:16</a>; <a href="../bible/heb012.htm#vrs26">Hebrews 12:26-27</a>). It is not surprising, then, that the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">earliest Christian writers</a> speak in the same strain of the Scriptures. <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">St. Clement of Rome</a> (<a href="../fathers/1010.htm">I Corinthians 45</a>) tells his readers to search the Scriptures for the truthful expressions of the Holy Ghost. St. Iren&aelig;us (<a href="../fathers/0103238.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> II.38.2</a>) considers the Scriptures as uttered by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> and His Spirit. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> testifies that it is granted by both <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> was written under (the influence of) the Holy Ghost (<a href="../fathers/04165.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> V.10</a>); again, he considers it as proven by <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Christ's dwelling in the flesh</a> that the Law and the Prophets were written by a heavenly charisma, and that the writings believed to be the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are not men's work (De princ., iv, vi). <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">St. Clement of Alexandria</a> receives the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who has given the Scriptures, as a reliable <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> (<a href="../fathers/02101.htm"><em>Stromata</em> I.2</a>).
<h3 id="C">According to ecclesiastical documents</h3>

<p>Not to multiply patristic testimony for the Divine authority of Scripture, we may add the official <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on the nature of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a>. The fifth <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> condemned <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a> for his opposition against the Divine authority of the books of Solomon, the Book of Job, and the Canticle of Canticles. Since the fourth century the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> concerning the nature of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> is practically summed up in the dogmatic formula that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the author of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a>. According to the first chapter of the <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> (A.D. 398), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> before being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> must express their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in this formula, and this profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is exacted of them even today. In the thirteenth century, <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> imposed this formula on the <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldensians</a>; <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a> exacted its acceptance from Michael Palaeologus, and the emperor actually accepted it in his letter to the <a href="../cathen/09476c.htm">Second Council of Lyons</a> (1272). The same formula was repeated in the fifteenth century by <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a> in his <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>, in the sixteenth century by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. IV, decr. de can. Script.), and in the nineteenth century by the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. What is implied in this Divine authorship of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a>, and how it is to be explained, has been set forth in the article <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">INSPIRATION</a>.
<h2 id="section3">Collection of Sacred Books</h2>

<p>What has been said implies that Scripture does not refer to any single book, but comprises a number of books written at different times and by different writers working under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Hence the question, how could such a collection be made, and how was it made in point of fact?
<h3 id="A">Question of right</h3>

<p>The main difficulty as to the first question (<em>quoestio juris</em>) arises from the fact that a book must be Divinely inspired in order to lay claim to the dignity of being regarded as Scripture. Various methods have been suggested for ascertaining the fact of inspiration. It has been claimed that so-called internal criteria are sufficient to lead us to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this fact. But on closer investigation they prove inadequate. <ul> <li><a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">Miracles</a> and prophecies require a Divine intervention in order that they may happen, not in order that they may be recorded; hence a work relating <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> or prophecies is not necessarily inspired. <li>The so-called ethico-aesthetic criterium is inadequate. It fails to establish that certain portions of Scripture are inspired writings, e.g., the genealogical tables, and the summary accounts of the kings of Juda, while it favours the inspiration of several post-Apostolic works, e.g., of the <a href="../cathen/07674c.htm">"Imitation of Christ"</a>, and of the "Epistles" of St. Ignatius Martyr. <li>The same must be said of the <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> criterium, or the effect which the perusal of Scripture produces in the heart of the reader. Such emotions are subjective, and vary in different readers. The Epistle of St. James appeared strawlike to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, divine to <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>. <li>These internal criteria are inadequate even if they be taken collectively. Wrong keys are unable to open a lock whether they be used singly or collectively. </ul> Other students of this subject have endeavored to establish Apostolic authorship as a criterium of inspiration. But this answer does not give us a criterium for the inspiration of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> books, nor does it touch the inspiration of the Gospels of St. Mark and St. Luke, neither of whom was an Apostle. Besides, the Apostles were endowed with the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">gift of infallibility</a> in their teaching, and in their writing as far as it formed part of their teaching; but <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> in writing does not imply inspiration. Certain writings of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a> may be <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a>, but they are not inspired; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not their author. Nor can the criterium of inspiration be placed in the testimony of history. For inspiration is a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> fact, known only to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and probably to the inspired writer. Hence human testimony concerning inspiration is based, at best, on the testimony of one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is, naturally speaking, an interested party in the matter concerning which he testifies. The history of the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of former times as well as of our own day teaches us the futility of such testimony. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and prophecy may, at times, confirm such human testimony as to the inspiration of a work. But, in the first place, not all inspired writers have been <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> or workers of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; in the second place, in order that prophecies or <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> may serve as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of inspiration, it must be clear that the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were performed, and the prophecies were uttered, to establish the fact in question; in the third place, if this condition be verified, the testimony for inspiration is no longer merely human, but it has become Divine. No one will <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the sufficiency of Divine testimony to establish the fact of inspiration; on the other hand, no one can deny the need of such testimony in order that we may distinguish with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> between an inspired and a non-inspired book.
<h3 id="B">Question of fact</h3>

<p>It is a rather difficult problem to state with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, how and when the several books of the Old and the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> were received as sacred by the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community. <a href="../bible/deu031.htm#vrs9">Deuteronomy 31:9, 24 sqq.</a>, informs us that Moses delivered the Book of the Law to the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> and the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to be deposited "in the side of the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant</a>"; according to <a href="../bible/deu017.htm#vrs18">Deuteronomy 17:18</a>, the king had to procure for himself a copy of at least a part of the book, so as to "read it all the days of his life". <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Josue</a> (<a href="../bible/jos024.htm">24:26</a>) added his portion to the law-book of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and this may be regarded as the second step in the collection of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> writings. According to <a href="../bible/isa034.htm#vrs16">Isaiah 34:16</a> and <a href="../bible/jer036.htm">Jeremiah 36:4</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> Isaias and Jeremias collected their respective prophetic utterances. The words of <a href="../bible/2ch029.htm#vrs30">2 Chronicles 29:30</a>, lead us to suppose that in the days of King Ezechias there either existed or originated a collection of the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms of David</a> and of Asaph. From <a href="../bible/pro025.htm#vrs1">Proverbs 25:1</a>, one may infer that about the same time there was made a collection of the Solomonic writings, which may have been added to the collection of psalms. In the second century B.C. the Minor <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">Prophets</a> had been collected into one work (Ecclus., xlix, 12) which is cited in <a href="../bible/act007.htm">Acts 7:42</a>, as "the books of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>". The expressions found in <a href="../bible/dan009.htm#vrs2">Daniel 9:2</a>, and I Mach., xii, 9, suggest that even these smaller collections had been gathered into a larger body of sacred books. Such a larger collection is certainly implied in the words II Mach., ii, 13, and the prologue of Ecclesiasticus. Since these two passages mention the main divisions of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old-Testament</a> canon, this latter must have been completed, at least with regard to the earlier books, during the course of the second century B.C.

<p>It is generally granted that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> acknowledged as canonical or included in their collection of sacred writings all the so-called protocanonical books of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. Christ and the Apostles endorsed this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, so that we have Divine authority for their Scriptural character. As there are solid reasons for maintaining that some of the New-Testament writers made use of the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint version</a> which contained the deuterocanonical books of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, these latter too are in so far attested as part of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a>. Again, II Pet., iii, 15-16, ranks all the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> with the "other scriptures", and <a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#vrs18">1 Timothy 5:18</a>, seems to quote <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#vrs7">Luke 10:7</a>, and to place it on a level with <a href="../bible/deu025.htm#vrs4">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>. But these arguments for the canonicity of the deuterocanonical books of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, of the Pauline Epistles, and of the Gospel of St. Luke do not exclude all reasonable <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. Only the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> bearer of tradition, can furnish us invincible <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> as to the number of the Divinely inspired books of both the Old and the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. See CANON OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES.
<h2 id="section4">Division of Scripture</h2>
<h3 id="A">Old and New Testaments</h3>

<p>As the two <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> of grace separated from each other by the advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> are called the Old and the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs28">Matthew 26:28</a>; <a href="../bible/2co003.htm#vrs14">2 Corinthians 3:14</a>), so were the inspired writings belonging to either economy of grace from the earliest times called books of the Old or of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, or simply the Old or the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. This name of the two great divisions of the inspired writings has been practically common among <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Christians</a> from the time of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, though <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> himself frequently employs the name "Instrumentum" or legally authentic document; <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> uses the title "Sacred Pandects", or sacred digest of law.
<h3 id="B">Protocanonical and deuterocanonical</h3>

<p>The word "canon" denoted at first the material rule, or instrument, employed in various trades; in a metaphorical sense it signified the form of perfection that had to be attained in the various arts or trades. In this metaphorical sense some of the early Fathers urged the canon of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the canon of tradition, the canon of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the canon of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> tenets of the early <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> (St. Clem., <a href="../fathers/1010.htm">I Corinthians 7</a>; Clement of Alexandria, <a href="../fathers/02101.htm"><em>Stromata</em> I.16</a>; <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="../fathers/04124.htm"><em>De Principiis</em> IV.9</a>; etc.). St. Iren&aelig;us employed another metaphor, calling the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a> the canon of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103311.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> III.11</a>); <a href="../cathen/08185c.htm">St. Isidore of Pelusium</a> applies the name to all the inspired writings (Epist., iv, 14). About the time of St. Augustine (Contra Crescent., II, xxxix) and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (Prolog. gal.), the word "canon" began to denote the collection of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>; among later writers it is used practically in the sense of catalogue of inspired books. In the sixteenth century, Sixtus Senensis, O.P., distinguished between protocanonical and deuterocanonical books. This distinction does not indicate a difference of authority, but only a difference of time at which the books were recognized by the whole Church as Divinely inspired. Deuterocanonical, therefore, are those books concerning the inspiration of which some Churches <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> more or less seriously for a time, but which were accepted by the whole Church as really inspired, after the question had been thoroughly investigated. As to the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, the Books of Tobias, Judith, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, I, II, Machabees, and also Esther, x, 4- xvi, 24, Daniel, iii, 24-90, xiii, 1-xiv, 42, are in this sense deuterocanonical; the same must be said of the following New- Testament books and portions: Hebrews, James, II Peter, II, III John, Jude, Apocalypse, <a href="../bible/mar013.htm#vrs9">Mark 13:9-20</a>, <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#vrs43">Luke 22:43-44</a>, <a href="../bible/joh007.htm">John 7:53-8:11</a>. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> writers often call the deuterocanonical Books of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> the Apocrypha.
<h3 id="C">Tripartite division of Testaments</h3>

<p>The prologue of Ecclesiasticus shows that the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old-Testament</a> books were divided into three parts, the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings (the Hagiographa). The same division is mentioned in <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#vrs44">Luke 24:44</a>, and has been kept by the later <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The Law or the Torah comprises only the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>. The second part contains two sections: the former Prophets (<a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Josue</a>, <a href="../cathen/08547a.htm">Judges</a>, Samuel, and Kings), and the latter Prophets (Isaias, Jeremias, Ezechiel, and the Minor <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">Prophets</a>, called the Twelve, and counted as one book). The third division embraces three kinds of books: first poetical books (Psalms, Proverbs, Job); secondly, the five Megilloth or Rolls (Canticle of Canticles, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther); thirdly, the three remaining books (Daniel, Esdras, Paralipomenon). Hence, adding the five books of the first division to the eight of the second, and the eleven of the third, the entire Canon of the Jewish Scriptures embraces twenty-four books. Another arrangement connects Ruth with the <a href="../cathen/08547a.htm">Book of Judges</a>, and Lamentations with Jeremias, and thus reduces the number of the books in the Canon to twenty-two. The division of the New-Testament books into the Gospel and the Apostle (Evangelium et Apostolus, Evangelia et Apostoli, Evangelica et Apostolica) began in the writings of the <a href="../cathen/01637a.htm">Apostolic Fathers</a> (St. Ignatius, "Ad Philad.", v; "Epist. ad Diogn., xi) and was commonly adopted about the end of the second century (<a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Irenaeus</a>, <a href="../fathers/0103103.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> I.3</a>; <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, "De praescr.", xxxiv; <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">St. Clement of Alexandria</a>, <a href="../fathers/02107.htm"><em>Stromata</em> VII.3, etc.</a>); but the more recent Fathers did not adhere to it. It has been found more convenient to divide both the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> and the New into four, or still better into three parts. The four parts distinguish between legal, historical, didactic or <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a>, and prophetic books, while the tripartite division adds the legal books (the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> and the Gospels) to the historical, and retains the other two classes, i.e., the didactic and the prophetic books.
<h3 id="D">Arrangement of books</h3>

<p>The catalogue of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> arranges the inspired books partly in a topological, partly in a chronological order. In the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, we have first all the historical books, excepting the two books of the Machabees which were supposed to have been written last of all. These historical books are arranged according to the order of time of which they treat; the books of Tobias, Judith, and Ester, however, occupy the last place because they relate personal history. The body of didactic works occupies the second place in the Canon, being arranged in the order of time at which the writers are supposed to have lived. The third place is assigned to the Prophets, first the four Major and then the twelve Minor <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">Prophets</a>, according to their respective chronological order. The Council follows a similar method in the arrangement of the New- Testament books. The first place is given to the historical books, i.e., the Gospels and the Book of Acts; the Gospels follow the order of their reputed composition. The second place is occupied by the didactic books, the Pauline Epistles preceding the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. The former are enumerated according to the order of dignity of the addresses and according to the importance of the matter treated. Hence results the series: Romans; I, II Corinthians; Galatians; Ephesians; Philippians; Colossians; <a href="../bible/1th000.htm">I</a>, II Thessalonians; I, II Timothy; Titus; Philemon; the Epistle to the Hebrews occupies the last place on account of its late reception into the canon. In its disposition of the <a href="../cathen/03453a.htm">Catholic Epistles</a> the Council follows the so- called western order: I, II Peter; I, II, III John; James; Jude; our <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> edition follows the oriental order (James; I, II, III, John; Jude) which seems to be based on <a href="../bible/gal002.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>. The Apocalypse occupies in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> the place corresponding to that of the Prophets in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>.
<h3 id="E">Liturgical division</h3>

<p>The needs of liturgy occasioned a division of the inspired books into smaller parts. At the time of the Apostles it was a received custom to read in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> service of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath-day</a> a portion of the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs21">Acts 15:21</a>) and a part of the Prophets (<a href="../bible/luk004.htm#vrs16">Luke 4:16</a>; <a href="../bible/act013.htm#vrs15">Acts 13:15, 27</a>). Hence the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> has been divided into fifty-four "parashas" according to the number of <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a> in the intercalary lunar year. To each <em>parasha</em> corresponds a division of the prophetic writings, called <em>haphtara</em>. The Talmud speaks of more minute divisions, <em>pesukim</em>, which almost resemble our verses. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> transferred to the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Christian Sunday</a> the Jewish custom of reading part of the Scriptures in the assemblies of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, but soon added to, or replaced, the Jewish lessons by parts of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> (St. Just., "I Apol.", lxvii; Tert., "De praescr.", xxxvi, etc.). Since the particular churches differed in the selection of the Sunday readings, this custom did not occasion any generally received division in the books of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. Besides, from the end of the fifth century, these Sunday lessons were no longer taken in order, but the sections were chosen as they fitted in with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> feasts and seasons.
<h3 id="F">Divisions to facilitate reference</h3>

<p>For the convenience of readers and students the text had to be divided more uniformly than we have hitherto seen. Such divisions are traced back to <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, in the second century. Ammonius, in the third, divided the Gospel text into 1162 <em>kephalaia</em> in order to facilitate a Gospel harmony. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, Euthalius, and others carried on this work of division in the following centuries, so that in the fifth or sixth the Gospels were divided into 318 parts (<em>tituli</em>), the Epistles into 254 (<em>capitula</em>), and the Apocalypse into 96 (24 <em>sermones</em>, 72 <em>capitula</em>). <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> relates that the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> text was divided into various parts (De inst. div. lit., I, ii). But all these various partitions were too imperfect and too uneven for practical use, especially when in the thirteenth century concordances (see <a href="../cathen/04195a.htm">CONCORDANCES</a>) began to be constructed. About this time, Card. Stephen Langton, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, who died 1228, divided all the books of Scripture uniformly into chapters, a division which found its way almost immediately into the <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> version and even into some <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> of the original texts, and passed into all the printed editions after the invention of printing. As the chapters were too long for ready reference, Cardinal Hugh of St. Cher divided them into smaller sections which he indicated by the capital letters A, B, etc. Robert Stephens, probably imitating R. Nathan (1437) divided the chapters into verses, and published his complete division into chapters and verses first in the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> text (1548), and later on also in the Greek original of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> (1551).
<h2 id="section5">Scripture</h2>

<p>Since Scripture is the written word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, its contents are Divinely guaranteed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, revealed either in the strict or the wider sense of the word. Again, since the inspiration of a writing cannot be known without Divine testimony, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must have revealed which are the books that constitute <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a>. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> teach that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Revelation was complete in the Apostles, and that its deposit was entrusted to the Apostles to guard and to <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgate</a>. Hence the apostolic deposit of Revelation contained no merely <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> in the abstract, but also the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as to its constituent books. Scripture, then, is an Apostolic deposit entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> belongs its lawful administration. This position of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> implies the following consequences:

<p>(1) The Apostles <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> both the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> as a document received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is antecedently probable that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should not cast his written Word upon men as a mere windfall, coming from no known authority, but that he should entrust its publication to the care of those whom he was sending to preach the Gospel to all nations, and with whom he had promised to be for all days, even to the consummation of the world. In conformity with this principle, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (De script. eccl.) says of the Gospel of St. Mark: "When Peter had heard it, he both approved of it and ordered it to be read in the churches". The Fathers testify to the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of Scripture by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> where they treat of the transmission of the inspired writings.

<p>(2) The transmission of the inspired writings consists in the delivery of Scripture by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> to their successors with the right, the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, and the power to continue its <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a>, to preserve its integrity and identity, to explain its meaning, to use it in proving and illustrating <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a>, to oppose and condemn any attack upon its <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, or any abuse of its meaning. We may infer all this from the character of the inspired writings and the nature of the Apostolate; but it is also attested by some of the weightiest writers of the early Church. St. Iren&aelig;us insists upon these points against the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, who appealed to Scripture as to private historical documents. He excludes this <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> view, first by insisting on the mission of the Apostles and upon the succession in the Apostolate, especially as seen in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Haer., III, 3-4); secondly, by showing that the preaching of the Apostles continued by their successors contains a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> guarantee of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> through the indwelling of the Holy Ghost (Haer., III, 24); thirdly, by combining the <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">Apostolic succession</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> guarantee of the Holy Ghost (Haer., IV, 26). It seems plain that, if Scripture cannot be regarded as a private historical document on account of the official mission of the Apostles, on account of the official succession in the Apostolate of their successors, on account of the assistance of the Holy Ghost promised to the Apostles and their successors, the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of Scripture, the preservation of its integrity and identity, and the explanation of its meaning must belong to the Apostles and their legitimate successors. The same principles are advocated by the great Alexandrian doctor, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (De princ., Praef.). "That alone", he says, "is to be believed to be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which in nothing differs from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and Apostolical tradition". In another passage (in Matth. tr. XXIX, n. 46-47), he rejects the contention urged by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> "as often as they bring forward canonical Scriptures in which every Christian agrees and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>", that "in the houses is the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>"; "for from it (the Church) alone the sound hath gone forth into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world". That the African Church agrees with the Alexandrian, is clear from the words of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (De praescript., nn, 15, 19). He protests against the admission of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> "to any discussion whatever touching the Scriptures". "This question should be first proposed, which is now the only one to be discussed, 'To whom belongs the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself: whose are the Scriptures'?. . .For the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Scriptures and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> expositions and all the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> traditions will be wherever both the <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">true Christian rule</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shall be shown to be". St. Augustine endorses the same position when he says: "I should not believe the Gospel except on the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>" (Con. epist. Manichaei, fundam., n. 6).

<p>(3) By virtue of its official and permanent promulgation, Scripture is a public document, the Divine authority of which is evident to all the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>(4) The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> necessarily possesses a text of Scripture, which is internally authentic, or substantially identical with the original. Any form or version of the text, the internal authenticity of which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has approved either by its universal and constant use, or by a formal declaration, enjoys the character of external or public authenticity, i.e., its conformity with the original must not merely be presumed juridically, but must be admitted as certain on account of the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility of the Church</a>.

<p>(5) The authentic text, legitimately <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, is a source and <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>, though it remains only a means or instrument in the hands of the teaching body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which alone has the right of authoritatively interpreting Scripture.

<p>(6) The administration and custody of Scripture is not entrusted directly to the whole Church, but to its teaching body, though Scripture itself is the common <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the members of the whole Church. While the private handling of Scripture is opposed to the fact that it is common <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, its administrators are bound to communicate its contents to all the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>(7) Though Scripture is the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a> alone, those outside her pale may use it as a means of discovering or entering the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> shows that they have no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to apply Scripture to their own purposes or to turn it against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He also teaches <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> how to contest the right of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to appeal to Scripture at all (by a kind of demurrer), before arguing with them on single points of Scriptural <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>.

<p>(8) The <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the teaching body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> include also that of issuing and enforcing decrees for promoting the right use, or preventing the abuse of <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>. Not to mention the definition of the Canon (see <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">CANON</a>), the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> issued two decrees concerning the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> concerning the interpretation of Scripture (see <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">EXEGESIS</a>, <a href="../cathen/07271a.htm">HERMENEUTICS</a>), and this last enactment was repeated in a more stringent form by the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> (sess. III, Conc. Trid., sess. IV). The various decisions of the <a href="../cathen/02557a.htm">Biblical Commission</a> derive their binding force from this same right of the teaching body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. (Cf. <a href="../cathen/14249b.htm">Stapleton</a>, Princ. Fid. Demonstr., X-XI; Wilhelm and Scannell, "Manual of Catholic Theology", London, 1890, I, 61 sqq.; Scheeben, "Handbuch der katholischen Dogmatik", Freiburg, 1873, I, 126 sqq.).
<h2 id="section6">Attitude of the Church towards the reading of the Bible in the vernacular</h2>

<p>The attitude of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as to the reading of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> in the vernacular may be inferred from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> practice and legislation. It has been the practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to provide newly-converted nations, as soon as possible, with vernacular versions of the Scriptures; hence the early Latin and oriental translations, the versions existing among the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, the Slavonians, the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, the French, and the partial renderings into English. As to the legislation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on this subject, we may divide its history into three large periods:

<p>(1) During the course of the first millennium of her existence, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> did not <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgate</a> any law concerning the reading of Scripture in the vernacular. The faithful were rather encouraged to read the Sacred Books according to their spiritual needs (cf. St. Iren&aelig;us, <a href="../fathers/0103304.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> III.4</a>).

<p>(2) The next five hundred years show only local regulations concerning the use of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> in the vernacular. On 2 January, 1080, <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> wrote to the Duke of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> that he could not allow the publication of the Scriptures in the language of the country. The letter was written chiefly to refuse the petition of the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> for permission to conduct Divine service in the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> language. The pontiff feared that the reading of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> in the vernacular would lead to irreverence and wrong interpretation of the inspired text (<a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">St. Gregory VII</a>, "Epist.", vii, xi). The second document belongs to the time of the <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldensian</a> and <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> had written to <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> that there existed in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> a perfect frenzy for the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> in the vernacular. In 1199 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> replied that in general the desire to read the Scriptures was praiseworthy, but that the practice was dangerous for the simple and unlearned ("Epist., II, cxli; <a href="../cathen/07583c.htm">Hurter</a>, "Gesch. des. Papstes Innocent III", <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, 1842, IV, 501 sqq.). After the death of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, the Synod of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> directed in 1229 its fourteenth canon against the misuse of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">Cathari</a>: "prohibemus, ne libros Veteris et Novi Testamenti laicis permittatur habere" (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, "Concilgesch", Freiburg, 1863, V, 875). In 1233 the Synod of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a> issued a similar prohibition in its second canon, but both these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> are intended only for the countries subject to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the respective <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, ibid., 918). The Third Synod of Oxford, in 1408, owing to the disorders of the <a href="../cathen/09333a.htm">Lollards</a>, who in addition to their crimes of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a> had introduced virulent interpolations into the vernacular <a href="../bible/index.html">sacred text</a>, issued a law in virtue of which only the versions approved by the local ordinary or the provincial council were allowed to be read by the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, op. cit., VI, 817).

<p>(3) It is only in the beginning of the last five hundred years that we meet with a general law of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> concerning the reading of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> in the vernacular. On 24 March, 1564, <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in his Constitution, "Dominici gregis", the Index of Prohibited Books. According to the third rule, the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> may be read in the vernacular by <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and learned men, according to the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as a help to the better understanding of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>. The fourth rule places in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or the inquisitor the power of allowing the reading of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> in the vernacular to <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> who according to the judgment of their confessor or their <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> can profit by this practice. <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> reserved this power to himself or the Sacred Congregation of the Index, and <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> added this restriction to the fourth rule of the Index, by way of appendix. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> required that the vernacular version read by <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> should be either approved by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> or provided with notes taken from the writings of the Fathers or of learned and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> authors. It then became an open question whether this order of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> was intended to supersede the former legislation or to further restrict it. This <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> was not removed by the next three documents: the condemnation of certain <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a> as to the necessity of reading the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a> issued by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> on 8 Sept., 1713 (cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Enchir.", nn. 1294-1300); the condemnation of the same teaching maintained in the <a href="../cathen/12116c.htm">Synod of Pistoia</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Auctorem fidei" issued on 28 Aug., 1794, by <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>; the warning against allowing the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> indiscriminately to read the Scriptures in the vernacular, addressed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10428a.htm">Mohileff</a> by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, on 3 Sept., 1816. But the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> issued by the Sacred Congregation of the Index on 7 Jan., 1836, seems to render it clear that henceforth the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> may read vernacular versions of the Scriptures, if they be either approved by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, or provided with notes taken from the writings of the Fathers or of learned <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> authors. The same regulation was repeated by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> of 8 May, 1844. In general, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has always allowed the reading of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> in the vernacular, if it was desirable for the spiritual needs of her children; she has forbidden it only when it was almost certain to cause serious spiritual harm.
