<h1>Seal</h1>  

<p>The use of a seal by men of wealth and position was common before the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> era. It was natural then that high functionaries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should adopt the habit as soon as they became socially and politically important. An incidental allusion in one of St. Augustine's letters (217 to Victorinus) lets us <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he used a seal. The practice spread and it seems to be taken for granted by <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a> at the very beginning of the Merovingian period (Mon. Germ. Hist.: Leg., II, 2). Later <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> require that letters under the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> seal should be given to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> when for some reason they lawfully quitted their own proper diocese. So it was enacted at Chalon-sur-Sa&ocirc;ne in 813. <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Pope Nicholas I</a> in the same century complains that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of D&ocirc;le and <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> had <em>contra morem</em> sent their letters to him unsealed (Jaff&eacute;, "Regesta", nn. 2789, 2806, 2823). The custom of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> possessing seals may from this date be assumed to have been pretty general. At first they were only used for securing the document from impertinent curiosity and the seal was commonly attached to the ties with which it was fastened. When the letter was opened by the addressee the seal was necessarily broken. Later the seal served as an authentication and was attached to the face of the document. The deed was thus only held to be valid so long as the seal remained intact. It soon came to follow from this point of view that not only real <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> like kings and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but also every kind of body corporate, <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters, municipalities, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, etc., also required a common seal to validate the acts which were executed in their name.

<p>During the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> seals of lead, or more properly <a href="../cathen/03052a.htm">"bulls"</a>, were in common use both in East and West, but except in the case of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chancery, these leaden authentications soon went out of favour in <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">western Christendom</a> and it became the universal practice to take the impressions in wax. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> hardly any waxen seals have survived of earlier date than the Norman Conquest. In the British Museum collection the earliest <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> seals preserved are those of William of St. Carileph, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> (1081-96) and of <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> (1093-1109). The importance of the seal as a means of authentication necessitated that when authority passed into new hands the old seal should be destroyed and a new one made. When the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> dies it is the first <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the Cardinal Camerlengo to obtain possession of the <a href="../cathen/13060a.htm">Fisherman's Ring</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> signet, and to see that it is broken up. A similar practice prevailed in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> and it is often alluded to by historians, as it seems to have been a matter of some <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. Thus we are concisely told: "There died in this year Robert de Insula, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>. After his burial, his seal was publicly broken up in the presence of all by Master Robert Avenel." (Hist. Dunel. Scrip. Tres., p. 63). <a href="../cathen/11499a.htm">Matthew Paris</a> gives a similar description of the breaking of the seal of William, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/13329a.htm">St. Albans</a>, in 1235.
