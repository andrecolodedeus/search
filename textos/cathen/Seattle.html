<h1>Seattle</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF SEATTLE (SEATTLENSIS).

<p>The Diocese of Seattle (Seattlensis) comprises the entire State of Washington, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> and embraces an area of 66,680 sq. miles with over a million inhabitants. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was originally created on 24 July, 1846, by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> as the See of Walla Walla, but on 31 May, 1850, the name was changed to that of the Diocese of Nesqually, with Vancouver, Washington, as the episcopal city. Owing to important considerations, the title was again changed, in September, 1907, to that of the Diocese of Seattle, with the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and residence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the city of the same name on Puget Sound.

<p>One hundred years ago the State of Washington formed a portion of that great <em>terra incognita</em> called the &quot;Oregon Country&quot;, whose rugged and romantic wilderness is described' by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary, <a href="../cathen/04752a.htm">Father De Smet</a>, in his account of the <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a> missions. The introduction of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> into the States of Washington and <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a> is somewhat remarkable. It was not primarily brought about, as in so many instances, by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, but by <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> who came at the earnest solicitations of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. Simon Plamondon of Cowlitz, Washington, initiated a petition for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in 1833, and renewed it in the year 1835. Hence, the State of Washington may lay claim to being the cradle of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in the North-west. The Hudson Bay Company for many years carried on an extensive fur trade in the North-west territory, which extended as far south as the Columbia River. Its employees were a heterogeneous aggregation; and hence, though an English corporation with headquarters in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, it numbered among them many <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a>. These hardy trappers and hunters, far from all civilization and with little hope of ever returning to their homes, took Indian <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> as wives and established <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> in the Wallamette and Cowlitz valleys on land granted to them by the company. These retired hunters, advancing in years, longed for the ministrations of the religion of their youth. The fatherly chief factor, <a href="../cathen/09504b.htm">Dr. John McLoughlin</a>, who presided at Fort Vancouver (established. in 1828), tried to maintain a religious spirit among his men, as much from policy as to satisfy their desires, by gathering them on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> for religious services; but he clearly saw, though himself a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> at that time, that his ministrations did not satisfy the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> missionaries arrived from the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. <a href="../cathen/09504b.htm">McLoughlin</a> welcomed them in the midst of his mixed class of settlers, hoping that now the religious problem was solved. He soon became aware that a denominational brand of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was distasteful to the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a>. On their behalf, therefore, he sent, in 1834 and 1835, two earnest appeals for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to the nearest <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Right Rev. J. N, Provencher of Red River, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and through him to Archbishop J. River, of Quebec. Their replies were most discouraging; they had no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to send to so distant a field. The Hudson Bay Company, moreover, informed of the appeal, refused transportation for any <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries to their territory. <a href="../cathen/09504b.htm">McLoughlin</a>, however, was not so easily conquered, and his services to the company were too important to be disregarded. Finally the Home Office relented, and in 1837 Fathers <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">F.N. Blanchet</a> and <a href="../cathen/04706a.htm">M. Demers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12593c.htm">Archdiocese of Quebec</a> were allowed to accompany the annual convoy to the North-west.

<p>The two missionaries arrived at <a href="../cathen/15267b.htm">Vancouver</a>, Washington, on 24 Nov., 1838. Their reception was an ovation for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Tears were shed when the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> was offered for the first time. When the few days of mutual <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> had passed the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> would willingly have proceeded to the south side of the Columbia where twenty-six <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> claimed their services, but the orders of their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superiors disposed otherwise, and they permanently located north of the Columbia River. The Hudson Bay Company maintained no less than twenty-eight established posts in the territory north of the Columbia River, which was inhabited by about 100,000 Indians. At Cowlitz, therefore, with its four <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Father Blanchet</a> opened his first mission, which can rightfully claim to be the parent church of the North-west. Here he erected in 1839 a log building, twenty by thirty feet in size, which he dedicated to <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, and which served as his <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and residence. During the erection of this building an unexpected difficulty presented itself. A delegation of Nesqually Indians wished to see the &quot;real Blackrobe&quot; and to be instructed by him. Being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of their language and at a loss to make himself understood, he thought of a novel contrivance to instruct them. He made a long flat stick or ladder with forty short parallel lines on it to represent the four thousand years before Christ; these were followed by thirty-three points and three crosses to show the years of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> life and the manner of His death. A church and twelve perpendicular marks denoted the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at the death of Christ through the Apostles; eighteen further horizontal marks and thirty-nine points showed the time elapsed since the death of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>. The lesson proved successful. The Indians took home copies of the stick, which they called the <em>Sa-cha-lee-stick</em>, and which is known as the &quot;Catholic ladder&quot;. On the completion of his <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> labours, <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Father Blanchet</a> made several short visits to the Wallamette Valley settlers.



<p>Meanwhile <a href="../cathen/04706a.htm">Father Demers</a> followed the route of the hunters and trappers, and visited the Indian settlements in the interior. He was welcomed everywhere by both whites and natives. During the following four years the two missionaries met but rarely-twice a year in Vancouver to console and encourage each other. The only change made in their lives during this period came when Chief Factor Douglas notified them (October, 1839) that his company had no longer any reason for preventing their establishing themselves south of the Columbia. In consequence of this notification, <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Father Blanchet</a> took up his residence at St. Paul, <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, while <a href="../cathen/04706a.htm">Father Demers</a> was left at the Cowlitz mission. From this moment he was in charge almost exclusively of the whole present State of Washington, although <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Father Blanchet</a> made a few journeys to the Nesqually Indians, and even planted the cross on Whitby Island, where he said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in 1840. Manuel Bernier of Newaukum Prairie accompanied <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Father Blanchet</a> from Cowlitz to the Nesqually Prairie and to Whitby Island, where they built the first church on Puget Sound. The Oblate Fathers also established missions for the Indians and whites on Puget Sound. The semi-annual meeting in 1842 was of special importance for the <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a> missions. <a href="../cathen/04752a.htm">Father De Smet</a>, who had come from the Rocky Mountains missions to Vancouver in quest of supplies, was present, and, as a result of the conference, he set out for <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to obtain help and to expose their needs to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a>. Archbishop Signay was likewise interested in their work; he had not only sent an appeal to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but, as soon as available, despatched to their assistance Fathers A. Langlois and J.B. Bolduc. These <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> arrived at <a href="../cathen/15267b.htm">Vancouver</a> on 17 Sept., 1843. The former took charge of Walla Walla. <a href="../cathen/04706a.htm">Father Demers</a> retired to the newly-founded <a href="../cathen/11293a.htm">Oregon City</a>. <a href="../cathen/04752a.htm">Father De Smet</a> returned in August, 1844, accompanied by four <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> and six Sisters of Notre-Dame de Namur; and almost simultaneously, on 4 Nov., 1844, at St. Paul, letters arrived, containing the news that the territory had been created a vicariate, with <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Father F.N. Blanchet</a> as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. The briefs appointing <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Father Blanchet</a> as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a> were received at <a href="../cathen/15267b.htm">Vancouver</a> on 4 Nov., 1844. He was named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> with the titular See of Philadelphia, which, on some representation to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was changed to that of Drusa, after his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, on 25 July, 1845. <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Bishop Blanchet</a> sailed for <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to lay the news of his extensive vicariate before the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04706a.htm">Father Demers</a> was appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and administrator of the vicariate during his absence. In the autumn of 1847 <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Bishop Blanchet</a> returned to the <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a> coast, accompanied by five <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, two <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, one <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a>, three <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>, three <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, and seven Sisters of Notre-Dame de Namur. Meanwhile <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> had transformed his vicariate into an <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>, and on his return he found himself the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a> City which comprised all the territory west of the Cascade Mountains. His suffragans were to be his own brother, <a href="../cathen/02593b.htm">Magloire</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the newly-created Diocese of Walla Walla which extended east of the Cascade Mountains, and his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> <a href="../cathen/04706a.htm">Father Demers</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the new <a href="../cathen/15267b.htm">Diocese of Vancouver</a> Island.

<p>A unique historical feature characterized the erection of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Province of <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>. The three constituting <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were created rather simultaneously than successively; they were the result of a wise division of a large field of labour rather than the dismemberment of a constituted and governed see. <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Vicar Apostolic F.N. Blanchet</a>, while returning from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was suddenly raised to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> dignity, and his brother, <a href="../cathen/02593b.htm">A.M.A. Blanchet</a>, seemingly without the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, was nominated and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> his suffragan before the former had actually taken charge of his archdiocese.

<p><a href="../cathen/02593b.htm">Bishop A.M.A. Blanchet</a> (<a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 27 Sept., 1846; d. 25 Feb., 1887), was formerly a canon of the <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Accompanied by Father A. B. Brouillet and two students from <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> and Father Rosseau with five Oblate Fathers from St. Louis, the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> arrived at Fort Walla Walla, on 5 Sept., 1847. Aided by his experienced brother, he soon acquainted himself with the new conditions and the great task before him, and during his long apostolic career he showed himself at all times a man of great self-sacrifice and wisdom under the most trying circumstances. His tact was especially tested when the deplorable massacre of Dr. M. Whitman and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> by enraged Cayuse Indians occurred in November, 1847. The troubles following this massacre and the reprisals by the whites during the subsequent Cayuse <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> placed the whole vicinity of Walla Walla for more than two years in such a state of turmoil that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to remove permanently to Fort Vancouver. Here he constructed of logs his residence and a church, his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> which he dedicated to St. James in memory of the St. James Cathedral of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. A few years later these buildings were replaced by better, though wooden, structures. With the approval of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, the name of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> seat were changed on 31 May, 1850, the diocese becoming known as the Diocese of Nesqually. The first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> for the Walla Walla <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was Father Chirouse, O.M.I. He was stationed at St. Rose's mission, which was established in 1847 among the Yakimas. On account of the Indian <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> this mission with St. Joseph's was abandoned, but was revived in 1866 by Father St. Onge and Rev. J. B. Boulet. The register of the Oblate Fathers for Puget Sound contains no less than 3,811 <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> from January, 1848, to August, 1868. The Tulalip mission among the Snohomish, Swinimish, Lummis and St. Pierre Reserve of Seattle or Duwamish Indians was opened in 1860. <a href="../cathen/04706a.htm">Bishop Demers</a> held the first religious service in Seattle. The present state (territory of Washington) then seceded from the old <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a> territory. This political change caused a new division of the Diocese of Nesqually, whose limits now became identified with those of the new territory. Little more remains to be said of <a href="../cathen/02593b.htm">Bishop Blanchet's</a> episcopate. A source of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> for him was the arrival, on 8 Dec., 1856 of several Sisters of Providence from <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, who on that day began their mission of charity in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> of the North-west. Broken in health and strength, <a href="../cathen/02593b.htm">Bishop Blanchet</a> resigned his office in 1879.

<p>Bishop A. Junger (<a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 28 Oct., 1879; d. 26 Dec., 1895) became the second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nesqually. He had been in the territory of Washington since his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> in 1862. His active missionary life as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was short. After two years as assistant to Father Brouillet at Walla Walla, he was recalled by <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Bishop Blanchet</a> to <a href="../cathen/15267b.htm">Vancouver</a>, where he laboured until he was left in charge of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> as its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. To him is due the erection at <a href="../cathen/15267b.htm">Vancouver</a> in 1884, of a large <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, Gothic in design and built of brick and stone, to replace the wooden structure erected thirty years previously. Bishop Junger's chief aim was to relieve his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, who were hardly able. to attend the wants of an increasing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population throughout the state, and to facilitate attendance at the Divine Services. Many small <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> were built during his incumbency. Another object of his solicitude was the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian education</a> of the younger generation. During his administration the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> transformed (1886) their common <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Spokane into a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for boys, and entered (1889) the small but growing town of Seattle. At his invitation the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a> and <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Orders, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Sisters of St. Dominic</a>, St. Francis, the Holy Names, and the Visitation entered the diocese and began their useful work. At his death the diocese had: 41 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; 37 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>; 21 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders.

<p>The Right Rev. Edward J. O'Dea (b. 23 Nov., 1856, at Roxbury, Mass.; <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 8 Sept., 1896, at <a href="../cathen/15267b.htm">Vancouver</a>) became third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nesqually and first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Seattle. Preceding his elevation to the episcopal dignity he spent twelve years in the service of the Archdiocese if <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was confronted with financial difficulties. He came into a strange territory, and had to assume a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> of $25,000 which at this period of incipient <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> development and general financial depression throughout the country pressed heavily upon him. The foundation for the reorganization of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was laid at a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held in 1898, when a constitution for its government was adopted and <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>. On this occasion also the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> financial embarrassment was taken from his shoulders by his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The spiritual needs of the youthful commonwealth were his next care. The former territory had become a state. The Indians, decimated by disease and other causes, were relegated to small reservations, and industrious and thrifty immigrant farmers were rapidly taking their places. From a white population of 75,000 in 1880 the new state was making gigantic strides towards its goal of more than one million inhabitants in 1910. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> solicitude was not limited to the general needs of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; it extended also to the wants of the children and the needy.

<p>He encouraged the establishment of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> when possible. In 1909 an industrial home for neglected and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> boys was established under his personal supervision. To protect the Italian immigrants and their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> against the dangers to their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in large cities, he invited the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart, an <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, to the city of Seattle, and encouraged them in their difficult and often ungrateful work. Washington's centre of population had shifted towards Puget Sound, and Seattle became a city of 237,000 inhabitants. Its new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of St. James, built on a hill overlooking the city and harbour, was begun in 1905 and was dedicated on 22 Dec., 1907. By <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 11 Sept., 1907, the name of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was changed to that of the Diocese of Seattle.
<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>There are in the diocese (1911): 141 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, including 52 of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders; 76 churches with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 166 mission <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; 43 brothers and 503 sisters of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders; 6 colleges for boys; 18 academies for girls, of which 2 are Normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; 32 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 5126 pupils; 1 protectorate, now accommodating 78 boys; 1 home for working girls; 2 rescue homes for girls; 6 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> with over 500 children; 13 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>; 3 homes for aged poor. The estimated <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of Washington is about 100,000.
