<h1>Sebastian Brunner</h1>  

<p>A versatile and voluminous writer, b. in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 10 December, 1814; d. there, 27 November, 1893. He received his college <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> from the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of his native city, his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> training at the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">Vienna University</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1838, and was for some years professor in the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> faculty of the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">Vienna University</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> honored him with the degree of Doctor of Theology. In the revolutionary year, 1848, he founded the "Wienver Kirchenzeitung", which he edited until 1865, and in which he scourged with incisive satire the Josephinist bondage of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It is mainly owing to his fearless championship, which more than once brought him into conflict with the authorities, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> today breathes more freely. He wrote some ascetical books and many volumes of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a>, also a biography of <a href="../cathen/04044a.htm">Clemens Hofbauer</a>, the apostle of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. His books of travel dealing with <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and especially <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, are distinguished by keen observations on men and manners, art and culture, and most of all on religion, and are thus connected closely with his apologetic and controversial writings. Among the latter may be mentioned his book on "The Atheist Renan and his Gospel". Brunner's voluminous historical works are very valuable, particularly those on the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. It is, however, as a humorist that Brunner takes a permanent place in the history of literature, for he counts among the best modern German humorous writers. His works of this class were composed partly in verse, which at times reminds the reader of Hudibras, and partly in the form of prose stories. One of the best of the former is "Der Nebeljungen Lied"; of the latter, "Die Prinzenschule zu M&ouml;pselgl&uuml;ck". These works, conceived with a high and noble purpose, are marked by brilliant satire, inexhaustible wit, and genuine humour, combined with great depth of feeling. A collection of his stories in prose and verse was published in eighteen volumes at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> in 1864. It is not surprising, though it is regrettable, that an author whose literary output was so vast and varied, often shows signs of haste and a lack of artistic finish. In his later years he turned his satirical pen against the undiscriminating worship of modern German literary celebrities.
