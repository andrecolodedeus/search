<h1>Sebastian von Rostock</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, b. at Grottkau, <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a>, 24 Aug. 1607; d. at <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, 9 June, 1671. He studied classics at Neisse and from 1627 to 1633, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at Olmutz. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in 1633 he was assigned to <a href="../cathen/14611a.htm">pastoral</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> at Neisse, and was distinguished for his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and oratorical talent. When the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedes</a> captured the city in 1642, Rostock was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> and deported to Stettin. After his release he was ennobled by the emperor, but remained <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Neisse until his transfer in 1649 to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>. Henceforth he played a prominent part in the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and in 1653 was appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. It was largely through his efforts that the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of reformation (<em>jus reformandi</em>), granted the emperor by the peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, was effectively exercised in the territory of <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, so that 656 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches which had been seized by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> were restored to their former owners. Considerable difficulty was experienced in providing suitable <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for these numerous churches, and in infusing new <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> into an almost completely-ruined diocese. But Rostock <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> his life to the task, in spite of the additional difficulty from the almost uninterrupted absence from their diocese of the three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> under whom he served. In 1664 he was himself elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and shortly after the civil administration of the district was also placed in his hands. He continued with greater independence in work of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> reorganization, endeavoured to suppress the power of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> over affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and to neutralize the anti-Catholic influence of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> teachers. He succumbed to an attack of apoplexy, superinduced by an imperial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> which suspended a decision that had been previously granted and which was favourable to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests.
