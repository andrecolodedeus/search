<h1>Sebastiano del Piombo</h1>  

<p>More correctly known as S<font size=-2>EBASTIANO</font> L<font size=-2>UCIANI</font>.

<p>Venetian portrait <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1485; d. in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1547. He was known as del Piombo, from the office, conferred upon him by <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>, of keeper of the leaden <a href="../cathen/13649a.htm">seals</a>. He was a pupil of Giovanni Bellini, and later on of <a href="../cathen/06564c.htm">Giorgione</a>. His first <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was to become a religious or an ecclesiastic, and it is probable that he took <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> and had every intention of proceeding to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, but he was strongly interested in music, devoted considerable time to studying that art, and in so doing became acquainted with <a href="../cathen/06564c.htm">Giorgione</a>, a clever musician, who it appears induced him to delay his procedure towards the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and give some attention to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. It was on <a href="../cathen/06564c.htm">Giorgione's</a> recommendation that he entered the studio of Bellini and, later, worked with <a href="../cathen/06564c.htm">Giorgione</a> in his own studio. From the time of his acquaintance with him, we hear no more of his intention to embrace an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> career. His earlier <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> were executed in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, but he was invited to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Agostino Chigi, who was then building the Farnesina Palace, and some of the decoration of the rooms was put in the hands of Luciani. His work attracted the attention of <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>, and the two men became warm friends. A little later <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> saw his work and praised it highly, but they were never friends because of the jealousy existing between <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a> and <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> and the friendship between Luciani and <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>. The works which Luciani executed in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and at <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> betrayed the strong influence of <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>. Their grandeur of composition could have come from no other artist of the time, but their magnificence of colour has nothing to do with the great <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>, and is the result of Luciani's genius. A special event in Luciani's career is connected with the commission given to <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> the picture of the Transfiguration. Cardinal de' Medici, who commissioned the picture, desired at the same time to give an <a href="../cathen/01356a.htm">altar-piece</a> to his titular <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Narbonne, and commissioned a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> to be called the "Raising of Lazarus", and to be of the same size as <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael's</a> "Transfiguration". The two works were finished at about the same time, and were exhibited. It was perfectly evident that Luciani owed a great deal to the influence and the assistance of <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>, but the colouring was so magnificent, and the effect so superb, that it created great excitement in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; notwithstanding that the "Transfiguration" by <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> was regarded as the greater picture, Luciani's work was universally admired. The picture is now in the English National Gallery.

<p>Luciani <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> a great many portraits, one of Cardinal de' Medici, another of Aretino, more than one portrait of members of the Doria <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, of the Farnese, and of the Gonzaga <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, and a clever one of Baccio Bandinelli the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>. His <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> was marked by vigour of colouring, sweetness, and grace; his portraits are exceedingly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and lifelike, the draperies well <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a>, and well drawn, but the feature of his work is the extraordinary quality of his colour and the atmosphere with all the delicate subtleties of colour value which it gives. In many of his pictures the colouring is as clear and fresh today as it was when it was first <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a>, and this more especially applies to the carnations, in other men's work the first to fade. After the death of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>, he was regarded as the chief <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and it was then that he acquired his position as keeper of the lead seals, an office which was lucrative and important, and which enabled him to have more leisure than hitherto had been at his disposal. His death took place at the time that he was <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Chigi <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, a work which was to be finished by Salviati. His pictures can be studied in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, St. Petersburg, and Travesio, three of his most notable portraits being those at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, and the fine portrait of <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a>, now at St. Petersburg.
