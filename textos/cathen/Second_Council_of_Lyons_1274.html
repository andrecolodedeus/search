<h1>Second Council of Lyons (1274)</h1>  

<p>The Second Council of Lyons was one of the most largely attended of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> assemblies, there being present five hundred <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, sixty <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, more than a thousand <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> or procurators. <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a>, who presided, had been a canon of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>; Peter of <a href="../cathen/14454a.htm">Tarentaise</a>, who assisted as <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, had been <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. It opened 7 May, 1274, in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. John. There were five other sessions (18 May, 7 June, 6 July, 16 July, 17 July). At the second session <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> owing to the excessive numbers rejected the proxies of chapters, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and unmitred <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a>, except those who had been summoned by name. Among those who attended the council were James I, King of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, the ambassadors of the Kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, the ambassadors of the Emperor Michael Palaeologus and the Greek <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the ambassadors of the Khan of the Tatars. The conquest of the Holy Land and the union of the Churches were the two <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> for the realization of which <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> had convoked the council.
<h2 id="section1">The Crusade</h2>

<p>Despite the protest of Richard of Mapham, dean of Lincoln, he obtained that during the six years for the benefit of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> a <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> should go to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but when James I, King of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, wished to organize the expedition at once the representatives of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> opposed the project, and a decision was postponed. Ambassadors of the Khan of Tatary arrived at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, 4 July, to treat with <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a>, who desired that during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> the Tatars should leave the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in peace. Two of the ambassadors were solemnly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> 16 July.
<h2 id="section2">Union of the Churches</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> had prepared for the union by sending in 1273 an embassy to Constantinople to Michael Palaeologus, and by inducing Charles, King of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and Philip, Latin Emperor of Constantinople, to moderate their political ambitions. On 24 June, 1274, there arrived at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> as representatives of Palaeologus, Germanus, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, Theophanes, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11043a.htm">Nic&aelig;a</a>, Georgius Acropolita, senator and great logothete, Nicholas Panaretus, president of the ward-robe, Berrhoeota, chief interpreter, and Georgius Zinuchi. The letter from Palaeologus which they presented had been written in the name of fifty <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and five hundred <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. On 29 June, the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul, <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> celebrated <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. John, the Epistle, Gospel and Creed were read or sung in Latin and Greek, the article "qui a patre filioque procedit" was sung three times by the Greeks. On 6 July, after a sermon by Peter of <a href="../cathen/14454a.htm">Tarentaise</a> and the public reading of the letter of Palaeologus, Georgius Acropolita and the other ambassadors promised fidelity to the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> twenty-six propositions which it denied, and promised the protection of the emperor to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the Holy Land. <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> intoned the "Te "Deum", spoke on the text "Desiderio desideravi hoc pascha manducare vobiscum", and on 28 July wrote joyful letters to Michael, to his son Andronicus, and forty-one <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>. Three letters dated February, 1274, written to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by Michael and Andronicus, in which they recognized his supremacy, exist as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the emperor's <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a>, despite the efforts to throw <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> on it by means of a letter of <a href="../cathen/08018a.htm">Innocent V</a> (1276) which seems to point to the conclusion that Georgius Acropolita, who at the council had promised fidelity to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, had not been expressly authorized by the emperor.

<p>The Council of Lyons dealt also with the reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in view of which <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> in 1273 had addressed questions to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and asked of Hubert de Romans, the former general of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Friars Preachers</a>, a certain programme for discussion and of John of <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>, the new general of the order, a draft of formal constitutions. Henri of G&ouml;lder, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, Frederick, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">St. Paul without the Walls</a>, the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/13024b.htm">Rhodes</a> and of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> were deposed for unworthiness, and certain <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> were suppressed. The council warmly approved the two orders of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">St. Dominic</a> and St. Francis. Fearing the opposition of the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> who had in his kingdom three religious <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military orders</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was abandoned of forming all <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military orders</a> into one. <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a>, to avoid a repetition of the too lengthy vacancies of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">papal see</a>, caused it to be decided that the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> should not leave the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> till the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had been elected. This constitution which inflicted certain material privations on the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> if the election was too long delayed, was suspended in 1276 by <a href="../cathen/01159a.htm">Adrian V</a>, and a few months later revoked by <a href="../cathen/08429c.htm">John XXI</a>, but was re-established later in many of its articles, and is even yet the basis of legislation on the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclaves</a>. Lastly the Council of Lyons dealt with the vacancy of the imperial throne. James I of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> pretended to it; <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> removed him and on 6 June Rudolph I was proclaimed King of the Romans and future emperor. Such was the work of the council during which died the two greatest <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, summoned by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, died at Frosinone (7 March, 1274) on his way to Lyons. <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, after important interviews at the Council with the Greek ambassadors, died 15 July, at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, and was praised by Peter of <a href="../cathen/14454a.htm">Tarentaise</a>, the future <a href="../cathen/08018a.htm">Innocent V</a>, in a touching funeral sermon.
