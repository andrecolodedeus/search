<h1>Secularization</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>s&aelig;cularizatio</em>)

<p>Secularization, an authorization given to religious with solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and by extension to those with simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> to live for a time or permanently in the "world" (s&aelig;culum), i.e., outside the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> and their order, while maintaining the essence of <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>. It is a measure of kindness towards the religious and is therefore to be distinguished from the "expulsion" of religious with solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and the "dismissal" of religious with simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, which are penal measures towards guilty subjects. On the other hand, as secularization does not annul the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>, it is distinct from absolute <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>; this likewise is a lenient measure, but it annuls the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and their <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, and the one dispensed is no longer a religious. As a general rule <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> is the measure taken in the case of religious with simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> while secularization is employed where there are solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. Nevertheless there are exceptions in both cases. Sometimes lay religious with solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> or lay sisters are wholly dispensed from their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> in the world being very difficult for <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay persons</a>; in other instances religious men or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> with simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are authorized at least for a time to lay aside their habit and live outside their houses, at the same time observing their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>; such is the case for instance with the religious men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, who have temporary renewable secularization in virtue of the Instructions of the S. C. of Bishops and Regulars (24 March, 1903). It is not therefore correct to speak of religious dispensed from their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> as secularized; the expression applies only to religious with solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, especially to religious <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.

<p>Secularization is granted to these regulars like <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> to religious with simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, either for reasons of general order or for motives of personal and private order. To the first class belong expulsions and suppression of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> by various governments, for instance, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in 1839, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in 1866, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1902; to the second class belong various reasons of health, <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, etc. Secularization may be summarized under two heads: maintenance of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, and at the same time relaxation of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> so far as is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in order to live in the world.

<p>Secularization is divided into temporary and perpetual; the first is simply the authorization given to a subject to live outside of his order, either for a fixed time, e.g., one or two years, or for the duration of particular circumstances, conditions of health, <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, business, etc., but there is no change in either the conditions or <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the religious. He is dependent on his superiors, only he is placed provisionally under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the place, to whom he is subject in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of obedience. In most instances the religious lays aside his habit, retaining privately however something indicative of his religious affiliation. At the expiration of the time of <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a> the religious returns to his <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, unless this temporary secularization be granted in preparation for perpetual secularization, e.g., to allow a religious <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to find a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who will consent to receive him in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Perpetual secularization on the other hand wholly removes the subject from his order, whose habit he puts off, and of which he no longer has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to ask his support, without previous agreement. But the one secularized does not cease to be a religious; his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> remain a permanent <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> and he thus continues to observe the essentials of a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of chastity being purely negative is observed in the world as in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>; the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of obedience remains intact, but henceforth binds the subject to his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to whom he owes not only canonical obedience, like every cleric, but also the full religious obedience vowed at profession. The <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty necessarily undergoes alleviation with respect to temporal goods, but binds as to capacity to acquire and give away, as well as to bequeath without <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indults</a>, which are readily granted at need. In the absence of <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indults</a> the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the secularized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> goes to his order (S. C. Bishops and Regulars, 6 June, 1836).

<p>But the most important aspect of perpetual secularization as regards regulars is the regulation of their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> status. The regular <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to poverty, the religious <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to a common revenue depend not on a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but on their superiors. If they pass by secularization into the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> they cannot remain without an ordinary and must necessarily be attached to a diocese. Formerly it was admitted that the one secularized fell once more under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of his original ordinary, but what was at first that ordinary's right eventually became a responsibility (cf. S. C. Bishops and Regulars in Colonien., 24 Feb., 1893), and this discipline aroused just complaints (cf. postulatum of the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, 19 Aug., 1892). Also the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Auctus admodum" given by the Congregation of Bishops and Regulars (4 Nov., 1892) declared that every religious cleric who desired to be secularized or to leave his congregation must first find a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> willing to receive him among his own <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and if prior to this he left his house he was suspended. Now no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is compelled to receive a religious into his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; if be admits him it is on the same condition as a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>. This is why by <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> the religious must first secure for himself an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> patrimony; in <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> where this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not observed religious acquire the same <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and contract the same <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> towards the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as incorporated <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clerics</a>. Though he may perform <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and receive legitimate emoluments he cannot without <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a> receive a residential <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> or a <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> (S. C. of Regular Discipline, 31 Jan., 1899).

<p>To prevent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> from becoming religious in order to attain <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> under the easiest conditions with the intention of subsequently seeking secularization and entering the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 15 June, 1909, decided that to all <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">Rescripts</a> of temporary or perpetual secularization or <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> be de facto annexed, even if they are not expressed, the following clauses and prohibitions, <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from which is reserved to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; these religious are debarred from: <ol> <li> every office (and if they are eligible to <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>) every <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> in major or minor <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>; <li> every position as teacher and office in greater or lesser <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>; in other houses for the instruction of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>; in <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> or institutes conferring degrees by Apostolic privilege; <li> every office in episcopal curi&aelig; <li> the office of visitor or director of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of men or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, even in <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> congregations; <li> habitual dwelling in localities where there are houses of the province or mission left by the religious.</ol> Finally if the religious wishes to return to his order he has not to make again his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> or his profession, but takes rank from the time of his return.

<p>The word secularization has a very different meaning when applied not to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> but to things. It then signifies <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> become secular, as has occurred on several occasions in consequence of governmental usurpation (see <a href="../cathen/08744a.htm">LAICIZATION</a>). The word may also signify the suppression of sovereign or of <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> right belonging to ecclesiastical dignitaries as such. The chief <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> principalities of the Holy Roman Empire, notably the electorates, were secularized by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 25 Feb., 1803. The word secularization may also be applied to the abandonment by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of its goods to purchasers after governmental confiscations, most frequently after a merciful composition or arrangement. Concessions of this kind were made by <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a> for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1554, by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> for Saxony in 1714, by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1801, by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in 1886, and finally by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1907.
