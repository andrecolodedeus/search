<h1>Segorbe</h1>  

<p>(Also CASTELL&Oacute;N DE LA PLANA; SEGOBIENSIS; CASTETELLIONENSIS)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, bounded on the north by Castell&oacute;n and Teruel, on the east by Castell&oacute;n, on the south by Valencia, and on the west by Valencia and Teruel, has its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the civil Provinces of Castell&oacute;n, <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a>, <a href="../cathen/14525a.htm">Teruel</a>, and Cuenca. It is suffragan of Valencia, and its capital, containing 7500 inhabitants, is also the capital of the Province of Castell&oacute;n de la Plana. This city, though the capital of a province, has no <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>: by the Concordat of 1851 the <a href="../cathen/14785a.htm">See of Tortosa</a>, to which diocese a large part of the province belongs, is to be transferred to it. According to the common opinion, Segorbe is the ancient Segobriga, of which Pliny speaks as the capital of Celtiberia. For this reason it is probable that the town has been the seat of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> from very early times; however, no name of any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Segorbe is known earlier than Proculus, who signed in the Third Council of Toledo. Porcarius assisted at the Council of Gundemar; Antonius, at the fourth of Toledo; Floridius, at the seventh; Eusicius, at the ninth and tenth; Memorius, at the eleventh and twelfth; Olipa, at the thirteenth; Anterius at the fifteenth and sixteenth. After this we have no information of its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> until the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> invasion, when its church was converted into a mosque. In 1172 Pedro Ruiz de Azagra, son of the Lord of Estella, took the city of Albarrac&iacute;n, and succeeded in establishing there a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (Mart&iacute;n), who took the title of <em>Arcabricense</em>, and afterwards that of <em>Segobricense</em>, thinking that Albarrac&iacute;n was nearer to the ancient Segobriga than to Ercavica or Arcabrica. When Segorbe was conquered by Jaime I in 1245, its church was purified, and Jimeno, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Albarrac&iacute;n, took possession of it. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Valencia opposed this, and Arnau of Peralta entered the church of Segorbe by force of arms. The controversy being referred to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Segorbe had part of their territory restored to them; but the Schism of the West supervened, and the <em>status quo</em> continued. In 1571 Francisco Soto Salazar being <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the Diocese of Albarrac&iacute;n was separated from Segorbe. Eminent among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the latter was Juan Bautista P&eacute;rez, who exposed the <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraudulent</a> chronicles. In modern times Domingo Canubio, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, and Francisco Aguilar, author of various historical works are worthy of mention.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, once a mosque, has been completely rebuilt in such a manner that it preserves no trace of <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> architecture. It is connected by a bridge with the old episcopal palace. Its time-stained tower and its <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> are built on a trapezoidal ground-plan. The restoration was completed in 1534; and in 1795 the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> was lengthened, and new altars added, in the episcopate of Lorenzo Haedo. Segorbe possessed a castle, in which King Martin of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> lived and held his court; but the demolition of this building was begun in 1785, and its materials were used for the construction of the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and <em>Casa de Misericordia</em>. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> given by Carlos III. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, the Augustinian <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and the Charterhouse (<em>Cartuja</em>) of Valdecristo have been converted to secular uses.
