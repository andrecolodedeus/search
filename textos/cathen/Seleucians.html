<h1>Seleucians</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> who are said to have flourished in Galatia. They derived their name from Seleucus, who with certain Hermias is said to have propounded and taught their peculiar <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. According to Philastrus (Liber Dicersarum Hacreseon, LV) the teaching of these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> was based on the crudest form of <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a>. While they maintained that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was incorporeal, they asserted that matter was coeternal with Him. They exceeded the usual <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualistic</a> tenets in attributing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as well as to matter. In their system the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of men were not created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but were formed from earthly components &#151; fire and air &#151; by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they said, did not sit at the right hand of the Father in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> because (Psalm xviii, 6) "He hath set his tabernacle in the sun" must be interpreted to mean that Christ left His body in the sun. They did not practise <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, basing their refusal to do so on the words of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#vrs11">Matthew 3:11</a>): "He shall <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you in the Holy Ghost and fire". By <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> they understood this present world, while <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">Resurrection</a> they explained as being merely the procreation over death with the expectation of a glorious <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. The doctrines of Seleucus and his adherents were the source of another series of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> taught by some of their disciples who called themselves Prolinianites or Hermeonites. These latter rejected the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">Resurrection</a> and Judgment. According to <a href="../cathen/11797a.htm">Philastrius</a> they perverted large numbers. It must be said that a great deal of uncertainty exists regarding the history and real cause of the fact that the doctrines of the Seleucians so closely resembled those of Hermogenes, and because Hermogenes is not mentioned by <a href="../cathen/11797a.htm">Philastrius</a>, conclude that these two were one and the same <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. This assumption is plausible but there are vital differences between the teaching of Hermogenes and that of the Seleucians as, for example, on the subject of Christ as Creator which, together with the virgin birth, was admitted by Hermogenes. If any weight is to be attached to a method of <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> which seems rather arbitrary, the date assigned by <a href="../cathen/11797a.htm">Philastrius</a> to the Seleucians, viz. After the reign of <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a>, would exclude the supposition that he confounded them with the followers of Hermogenes.
