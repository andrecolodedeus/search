<h1>Seleucids</h1>  

<p>The name given to the Macedonian dynasty, which was founded by Seleucus, a general under Alexander the Great, and ruled over <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> from 312 B.C. In 321 Seleucus received the satrapy of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a> from Antipater, administrator of Alexander's empire. After being temporarily supplanted by Antigonus, he returned to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a> after the battle of <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a> (312), from which his rule is dated (the first year of the Seleucid era). SELEUCUS I NICATOR (312-281 B.C.) assumed the title of king in 306. He first subdued Upper <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> as far as the Indus and Jaxartes The battle of <a href="../cathen/08098a.htm">Ipsus</a> brought <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> under his dominion; although he had to recognize the supremacy of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> over <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a> and Palestine. By a victory over Lysimachus he conquered the greater part of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> (281), but a little later, when he encroached on <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> territory, he was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> by Ptolemy Ceraunus. Besides various other cities, Seleucus founded the magnificent residential towns of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a> on the Tigris and Antiochia on the Orontes.

<p>He was succeeded by his son, ANTIOCHUS I SOTER (281-61), who, through fear of the Parthians, transferred his residence to Antiochia.

<p>Under Soter's son, ANTIOCHUS II THEOS (261-46), began the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with the Ptolemies for the possession of <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a> and Palestine. The marriage of Antiochus II to <a href="../cathen/02489b.htm">Berenice</a>, daughter of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, brought about a temporary cessation of the struggle; but on Ptolemy's death, Laodice, the first and disowned wife of Antiochus, was recalled and avenged herself by having Antiochus, <a href="../cathen/02489b.htm">Berenice</a>, and their child <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>.

<p>The son of Antiochus and Laodice, SELEUCUS II CALLINICUS (246-26), succeeded. To avenge the death of his sister and to assure his possession of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, King Ptolemy III Euergetes made a successful campaign against Seleucus, advancing victoriously as far as the Euphrates. The eastern provinces passed gradually into the hands of the Parthians, and portions of the western were lost to Attalus II of <a href="../cathen/11666a.htm">Pergamum</a>. While in flight after a battle in which he had suffered defeat at the hands of Attalus, Seleucus was killed by a fall from his horse.

<p>SELEUCUS III CERAUNUS (226-24), the elder son of Seleucus, succeeded, and on his assassination the younger son ANTIOCHUS III THE GREAT (224-187). To secure possession of Coele-Syria and Palestine this monarch began a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with Ptolemy V; although defeated at Raphia (217), the battle of Paneas (198) resulted in his favor, Palestine thenceforth belonging to the Syrian Empire. Interference in the affairs of the west led to a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. After the battle of <a href="../cathen/09533a.htm">Magnesia</a> (189) the king had to accept harsh conditions and surrender his possessions in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> north of the Taurus. Antiochus was unable to conquer Parthia, which his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> had lost. During an attempt to plunder a temple in Elam, he was slain by the natives.

<p>He was succeeded by his elder son, SELEUCUS IV PHILOPATOR (187-75). Seleucus secured the return of his younger brother Antiochus, who lived as a hostage in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, by sending his own son Demetrius thither instead. Before Antiochus arrived home, Seleucus had been <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> by his minister Heliodorus; the former was thus able to take possession of the Throne, which really belonged to his nephew Demetrius.

<p>ANTIOCHUS IV EPIPHANES (175-64) was an ambitious prince, of a truly despotic nature and fond of display. Entanglements with <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> gave him the occasion to make repeated successful inroads into that country, and in 168 he might have succeeded in securing possession of it, had not the Romans compelled him to withdraw (embassy of Popilius Laenas). His hostile measures against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, whom he tried to hellenize by sheer force, resulted in the <a href="../cathen/09493b.htm">Machabean</a> rising (see <a href="../cathen/09493b.htm">THE MACHABEES</a>). He died at <a href="../cathen/14423a.htm">Tab&aelig;</a> in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, while on a campaign against the Parthians.

<p>His son ANTIOCHUS V EUPATOR (164-62) was a minor, and simply a tool in the hands of the imperial administrator Lysias. Both were removed by the son of Seleucus IV, DEMETRIUS I SOTER (162-15), who had previously lived as a hostage at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Alexander Balas, who claimed to be a son of Antiochus IV, rebelled in 151, and Demetrius fell in battle. His son Demetrius continued the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Alexander Balas (150-45) in union with the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> king Ptolemy VI. Conquered by the latter near Antiochia, Alexander fled to <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, and was there treacherously <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a>.

<p>DEMETRIUS II NICATOR (145-38 and 129-25) found his right to the throne contested by Diodotus (surnamed Tryphon), a general of Balas, in favor of the latter's son Antiochus VI, a minor. Later (141), setting aside his ward, Tryphon strove to secure the throne for himself. When Demetrius II was captured during an expedition against the Parthians and cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, his brother Antiochus continued the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Tryphon, who, being finally overcome committed <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a> (138).

<p>ANTIOCHUS VII SIDETES(138-29) was killed during a campaign against the Parthians. Demetrius II, who had been released from captivity during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, now became king for the second time (129-25). An anti-king in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Alexander Zabinas, a supposed son of Alexander Balas, was set up in 128 by the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> king, Ptolemy VII Physcon. Conquered near <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, Demetrius had to flee, and was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> when he attempted to land in <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>.

<p>He was followed by his elder son SELEUCUS V, who, at the instigation of his own mother, was removed shortly after his accession. His younger brother, ANTIOCHUS VIII GRYPUS (125-113) conquered Alexander Zabinas and had him executed (125), but he himself was driven from his throne by his maternal half-brother ANTIOCHUS IX CYZICENUS (113-95), the youngest son of Antiochus VII. Returning, however, after two years, Grypus succeeded in winning for himself a large part of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, the king dom being thus divided.

<p>On the death of Antiochus VIII (96) his domains and claims were inherited by his elder son SELEUCUS VI. Defeated by Seleucus near Antiochia in 95, Antiochus IX committed <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a> to escape <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. However, his son ANTIOCHUS X defeated Seleucus in the same year, and the latter had to flee to Cilicia, where he died. His two brothers ANTIOCHUS XI and Philip continued the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, but were defeated, and during the flight Antiochus XI met death in the waves of the Orontes. PHILIP continued the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and succeeded in securing possession of at least a portion of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, while the fourth son of Antiochus VIII, DEMETRIUS III EUCERUS, was elevated to the rank of king in Damascus by Ptolemy Soter II of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.

<p>Antiochus X was finally overcome by the brothers, Philip and Demetrius. Concerning his death we have conflicting reports. According to Appian he was first completely ousted by Tigranes (see below), although he seems to have asserted himself in a portion of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. Failing in his design of reconquering <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, Demetrius endeavoured to supplant his brother Philip, besieging him in <a href="../cathen/02513b.htm">Beroea</a>, but was surrounded by the Parthians whom Philip had summoned to his aid, and forced to surrender. He died at the Court of the Parthian king. Philip now marched on Antiochia, secured possession of the city, and thenceforth held sway over <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> (about 88).

<p>In Coele-Syria and Damasous, however, appeared a new pretender in his youngest brother, ANTIOCHUS XII DIONYSUS, who made himself king of these parts, but later fell in a campaign against the Nabataeans (about 84). Meanwhile, King Tigranes of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> appeared from the north, and in 83 succeeded in possessing himself of the kingdom.

<p>After overcoming Tigranes in 69, Lucullus granted the realm to the son of Antiochus X, ANTIOCHUS XIII ASIATICUS, the last of the Seleucids. In 64 Pompey made <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> a Roman province, and Antiochus XIII was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> a short time afterwards.
