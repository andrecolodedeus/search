<h1>Selymbria</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a> in Thracia Prima, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/07242b.htm">Heraclea</a>. Selymbria, or Selybria, the city of Selys on the Propontis, was a colony of the <a href="../cathen/10146a.htm">Megarians</a> founded before Byzantium. It was the native place of Prodicus, a disciple of Hippocrates; there Xenophon met Medosades, the envoy of Seuthes, whose army later encamped near by. In 410 B.C. Aleibiades, who commanded in the Propontis for the Athenians, was not allowed to enter the town, but the inhabitants paid him a sum of money; somewhat later he captured it by treason and left a garrison there. In 351 B.C., Selymbria was an ally of the Athenians and in 343 was perhaps attacked by Philip. In honor of Eudoxia, wife of the Emperor Arcadius, it was called Eudoxiopolis still its official name in the seventh century, doubtless together with the older one which finally survived. In 805 it was pillaged by the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> king, Kroum. Michael III constructed a fortress the ruins of which are still existing there. The town is often mentioned by the Byzantine historians; in 1096 <a href="../cathen/06624b.htm">Godfrey of Bouillon</a> ravaged the country. Cantacuzenus celebrated the marriage of his daughter Theodora and the sultan Orkhan with great pomp at Selymbria. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> captured the town in 1453. It is now Silivri, chief town of a caza in the vilayet of Adrianopolis, containing 8000 inhabitants, <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and Greeks, mostly farmers or fishermen.

<p>In the tenth century it became an autocephalous <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> and under Marcus Comnenus a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> without suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. It would be easy, therefore, to add to the list of its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> given by <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> in "Oriens christianus", I, 1137. The oldest known is Theophilus transferred from <a href="../cathen/01592b.htm">Apamea</a> (<a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, <a href="../fathers/26017.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.36</a>). We may mention before the Schism: Romanus, 448, 451; Sergius, 80; George, 692; Epiphanius, author of a lost work against the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclasts</a>. Simeon assisted in 879 at the Council of Constantinople which re-established Photius. Under Michael Palaeologus, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Selymbria, whose name is unknown, was one of the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who signed a letter to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on the union of the Churches. In 1347 Methodius was one of the signatories at the Council of Constantinople which deposed the patriarch John Calecas, the adversary of the Palamites. The date of Ignatius, who wrote a "Life of Constantine and Helena" is unknown, perhaps about 1431. Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> omitted by <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> must be mentioned Philotheus, who lived about 1365, the author of the panegyric on St. Agathonicus, a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> who suffered at Selymbria under <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Maximian</a>, and of the panegyric on Saint (?) Macarius, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Constantinople towards the end of the thirteenth century (Krumbacher, "Gesch. der byzant. Litteratur", <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 1897, 205).
