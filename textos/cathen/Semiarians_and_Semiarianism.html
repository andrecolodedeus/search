<h1>Semiarians and Semiarianism</h1>  

<p>A name frequently given to the conservative majority in the East in the fourth century as opposed to the strict <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. More accurately it is reserved (as by <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>, "H&aelig;r" lxxiii) for the party of reaction headed by Basil of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a> in 358. The greater number of the Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who agreed to the deposition of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> in 335 and received the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> to communion at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> on their repentance, were not <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, yet they were far from being all <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. The dedication Council of Antioch in 341 put forth a creed which was unexceptionable but for its omission of the Nicene "of One Substance". Even disciples of Anius, such as George, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> (335-47) and <a href="../cathen/05628b.htm">Eustathius of Sebaste</a> (c. 356-80), joined the moderate party, and after the death of <a href="../cathen/05623b.htm">Eusebius of Nicomedia</a>, the leaders of the count faction, Ursacius, <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a>, and Germinius, were not tied to any formula, for Constantius himself <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, though he disliked <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> yet more. When <a href="../cathen/09642a.htm">Marcellus of Ancyra</a> was deposed in 336, he was succeeded by Basil. Marcellus was reinstated by the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 343, but Basil was restored in 350 by Constantius, over whom he gained considerable influence. He was the leader of a council at <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a> in 351 held against Photinus who had been a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> at <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a>, and the canons of this synod begin by condemning <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> though they do not quite come up to the Nicene standard. Basil had afterwards a disputation with the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> A&euml;tius. After the defeat of Magnentius at Mursa in 351, <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that city, became the <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a> of Constantius. In 355 <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> and Ursacius obtained the exile of the Western confessors <a href="../cathen/05623b.htm">Eusebius</a>, Lucifer, <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a>, and that of Hilary followed. In 357 they issued the second Creed of <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a>, or "formula of Hosius", in which <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousios</a></em> and <em>homoiousios</em> were both rejected. Eudoxius, a violent <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>, seized the See of Antioch, and supported A&euml;tius and his disciple <a href="../cathen/05605a.htm">Eunomius</a>.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> of 358 Basil with many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was holding the dedicatory feast of a new church he had built at <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a>, when he received a letter from George of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> relating how Eudoxius had approved of A&euml;tius, and begging Macedonius of Constantinople, Basil, and the rest of the assembled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> the expulsion of Eudoxius and his followers from Antioch, else that great see were lost. In consequence the Synod of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a> published a long reply addressed to George and the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a>, in which they recite the Creed of Antioch (341), adding explanations against the "unlikeness" of the Son to the Father taught by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> (<a href="../cathen/05605a.htm">Anomoeans</a>, from <em>anomoios</em>), and showing that the very name of father implies a son of like substance (<em>homoiousios</em>, or <em>homoios kat ousian</em>) <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">Anathematisms</a> are appended in which <a href="../cathen/05605a.htm">Anomoeanism</a> is explicitly condemned and the teaching of "likeness of substance" enforced. The nineteenth of these canons forbids the use also of <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousios</a></em> and <em>tautoousios</em>; this may be an afterthought due to the instance of Macedonius, as Basil does not seem to have insisted on it later. Legates were dispatched to the Count at <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a>&mdash;Basil, <a href="../cathen/05628b.htm">Eustathius of Sebaste</a>, an ascetic of no dogmatic principles, Eleusius of <a href="../cathen/04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a>, a follower of Macedonius, and Leontius, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who was one of the emperor's <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>. They arrived just in time, for the emperor had been lending his ear to an Eudoxian; but he now veered round, and issued a letter (<a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, IV, xiv) declaring the Son to be "like in substance" to the Father, and condemning the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> of Antioch.

<p>According to <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> it was at this point that Libenius was released from exile on his signing three fornmul&aelig; combined by Basil; against this story see <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">POPE LIBERIUS</a>. Basil persuaded Constantius to summon a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>, Ancyra being proposed then Nicomedia; but the latter city was destroyed by an earthquake; Basil, therefore, was again at <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a> in 359 where the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianizers</a> had meanwhile regained their footing With Germinius of <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a>, George of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, Ursacius and <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a>, and Marcus of <a href="../cathen/01701d.htm">Arethusa</a>, he held a conference which lasted until night. A confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, ridiculed under the name of the "dated creed", was drawn up by Marcus on 22 May (Hilary, "Fragment. xv"). <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> was of course rejected, but the <em>homoios kata ten ousian</em> was not admitted, and the expression <em>kata panta homoios</em>, "like in all things", was substituted. Basil was disappointed, and added to his signature the explanation that the words "in all things" mean not only in will, but in existence and being (<em>kata ten hyparxin kai kata to einai</em>). Not content with this, Basil, George of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a>, and others published a joint explanation (Epiphanius, lxxiii, 12-22) that "in all things" must include "substance";

<p>The court party arranged that two councils should be held, at <a href="../cathen/13057b.htm">Rimini</a> and Seleucia respectively. At Seleucia (359) the Semiarians were in a majority, being supported by such men as <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a>, his friend Silvanus of <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>, and even St. Hilary, but they were unable to obtain their ends. Basil, Silvanus, and Eleusius, therefore, went as envoys to Constantinople, where a council was held (360) which followed <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a> in condemning <em>homoiousios</em> together with <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousios</a></em>, and allowed <em>homoios</em> alone, without addition. This new phrase was the invention of Acacius of C&aelig;sarea, who now deserted the extremer <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and became leader of the new "Homoean" party. He procured the exile of Macedonius, Eleusius, Basil, Eustathius, Silvanus, Cyril, and others.

<p>Constantius died at the end of 361. Under <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a> the exiles returned. Basil was probably dead. Macedonius organized a party which confessed the Son to be <em>kata panta homoios</em>, while it declared the Holy Ghost to be the minister and servant of the Father and a creature. Eleusius joined him, and so did Eustathius for a time. This remnant of the Semiarian party held <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> at Zele and elsewhere. The accession of Jovian, who was <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, induced the versatile Acacius, with <a href="../cathen/10161b.htm">Meletius of Antioch</a> and twenty-five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, to accept the Nicene formula, adding an explanation that the Nicene Fathers meant by <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousios</a></em> merely <em>homoios kat ousian</em>. Thus Acacius had taken up the original formula of the Semiarians. In 365 the Macedonians assembled at <a href="../cathen/08770b.htm">Lampsacus</a> under the presidency of Eleusius, and condemned the Councils of <a href="../cathen/13057b.htm">Ariminum</a> and Antioch (360), asserting again the likeness in substance. But the threats of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> emperor <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> caused Eleusius to sign an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> creed at <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> in 366. He returned to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> full of remorse, and begged for the election of another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; but his diocesans refused to let him resign. The West was at peace under Valentinian, so the Semiarians sent envoys to that emperor and to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to get help. <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a> refused to see them until they presented him with a confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which included the Nicene formula. He seems to have been unaware that the party now rejected the Divinity of the Holy Ghost; but this was perhaps not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the envoys Eustathius and Silvanus. On the return of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, the documents they brought were received with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> by a synod at <a href="../cathen/15106b.htm">Tyana</a>, which embraced the Nicene <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But another synod in Caria still refused the <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousion</a></em>. For the rest of the history of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, who are now to be called Macedonians, see <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">PNEUMATOMACHI</a>.
