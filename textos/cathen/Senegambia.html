<h1>Senegambia</h1>  

<p>(SENEGAMBLE).

<p>Vicariate Apostolic, to which is joined the Prefecture Apostolic of Senegal (Senegalensis), both in French West Africa. A trading settlement established in this region in the fourteenth century by the Norman Jehan Prunaut was brought to an end by the troubles of the Hundred Years' War. Portuguese caravels first appeared off Gambia and Sierra Leone in 1432, and in 1446 occurred the first sale of the natives of these regions in the public market of Lagos, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. So great were the profits of the traffic thus inaugurated that the English were determined to share them and in 1558 the Royal Chartered Company was organized, the major share of the gains going to Queen Elizabeth. The <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> followed in 1617. Then the French under Cousin renewed their commercial relations with the country, but they also planted the Cross in the territory of which they took possession and erected a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. In 1637 the recently-founded <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a> sent a company of Norman <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> to "Old Guinea", others soon following, but the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> poisoned one of the missionaries and expelled the others. War broke out between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> in 1672, and Admiral d'Estr&eacute;es captured all the trading-posts of Senegal. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> thereupon entered the country under French protection and in 1686 the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Observants also began mission work there. Temporal affairs especially under the direction of the devout Andr&eacute; Br&uuml;e, head of the Company of Senegal, were admirably administered at this period, but the religious welfare of the natives was wholly neglected. In 1758 the towns of St. Louis and Gor&eacute;e were captured by the British, Gor&eacute;e alone being restored to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1763, in which year Senegal was made a <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefecture Apostolic</a>.

<p>Despite the promises made by the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government on the occasion of the treaty, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of St. Louis were hindered in the practice of their religion. Although they were allowed to assemble, the British governor would not permit them to have either church or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. P&egrave;re Bertout, a member of the <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Congregation of the Holy Ghost</a>, to whose initiative after the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolutionary</a> period was due the re-establishment of his order and to whom <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> confided the religious interests of numerous French colonies, was, in April, 1778, shipwrecked off the African coast, with his companion, P&egrave;re de Glicourt. They were taken captive by <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> and carried to St. Louis, where the governor reluctantly ransomed them, and for a time they were able to labour <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> and with success among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population. But they were soon despatched to Goree, whence they returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and sought an immediate audience with the Minister of Marine, in which they described the disabilities of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of St. Louis. The result was the sending of a French fleet under the command of <a href="../cathen/15311a.htm">Comte du Vaudreuil</a> and on 28 January, 1779, the French Protectorate was restored; P&egrave;re de Glicourt returned as <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">Prefect Apostolic</a> of Senegal, making his residence at St. Louis, while his companion P&egrave;re S&eacute;veno went to Goree. Despite the favourable auspices under which it was now placed, the mission had to pass through many years of hardships, owing to poverty, disputes between the prefects Apostolic and the governors, and mistakes in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration. Although in 1821, under the administration of Mgr Barad&egrave;re, the construction of the churches of Gor&eacute;e and St. Louis was favourably begun, in 1822 there was not a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in Senegal. But the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of Cluny had arrived in 1819 and in 1822, their foundress, <a href="../cathen/08326a.htm">M&egrave;re Javouhey</a>, went in person to establish a house at Goree. In 1841 the Brothers of Plo&euml;rmel were sent to the Mission. On the appointment of <a href="../cathen/09223a.htm">P&egrave;re Jacob Libermann</a> to the post of <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefect Apostolic</a>, a radical change took place, not only in the reorganization of the colonial <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> but also in the intercourse between the civil and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> powers, while the movement was inaugurated for the emancipation and moral regeneration of the slaves. When the emancipation <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the provisional Government was published, 27 April, 1848, 9800 slaves and 550 <em>engag&eacute;s</em> were freed in St. Louis and Gor&eacute;e alone and were assembled by the vice-prefect Apostolic for a solemn <a href="../cathen/14468c.htm">Te Deum</a>.

<p>In accordance with the plan of reorganization recommended by <a href="../cathen/09223a.htm">P&egrave;re Libermann</a> the Vicariate Apostolic of the Two Guineas and Senegambia was erected 22 Sept., 1846, consisting of the territory between the Prefecture of Senegal and the Diocese of Loanda. The religious service of the country was confided to the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Congregation of the Holy Ghost</a>, the first titular being Mgr Beno&icirc;t Truffet, who reached Goree, 9 April, 1847. He died on 19 November following, and was succeeded by P&egrave;re Bessieux who proceeded to Gaboon, which he had already evangelized, leaving his coadjutor, Mgr Kob&egrave;s, at Dakar, since 1895 the official seat of the Government of Freneh West Africa. Mgr Kob&egrave;s may be considered the real founder of the Mission of Senegambia, becoming vicar Apostolic when in 1863 it was separated from the Two Guineas. He increased the establishments of the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> and invited to Dakar the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception, founded at Castres in 1836 by Mere Marie de Villeneuve. Encouraged by him, P&egrave;re Barbier founded at Dakar (24 May, 1858) the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary, composed of native <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who have rendered inestimable services among <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> as well as among their own race. A <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for native <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> was inaugurated and is now situated at Ngasobil. Mgr Kob&egrave;s made an energetic attempt to establish the cotton industry among the natives, but a series of locust plagues caused it to be abandoned. Mgr Kob&egrave;s died 11 Oct., 1872, and was succeeded by Mgr Duret, who had been <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">Prefect Apostolic</a> of Senegal and now united both jurisdictions. At his death (29 Dec., 1875) he was succeeded by Mgr. Dubain (1876-83), who fixed his residence at Dakar, which has since remained the residence of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>. Chief among his mission foundations was that at the ancient trading-post of Rufisque (1878). His successors were Mgr Riehl (1884-86), Mgr Picarda (1887-89), Mgr Barthel (1889-99), Mgr Buleon (1899-1900), Mgr Kunemann (1900-08). The present <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> is Mgr Jalabert, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Telepe.

<p>In the Vicariate Apostolic of Senegambia there are 5,000,000 inhabitants, of whom 19,000 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 2740 of this number belonging to Senegal. There are 39 <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 6 native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 53 brothers 106 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, 16 churches or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> and 15 stations, 24 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys, 16 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls, 4 agricultural <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, 15 dispensaries, 7 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or infirmaries In Senegal there are churches at St. Louis and Goree, and 50 stations where the natives are taught. Civilly Senegal forms a separate colony while Senegambia belongs to that of Upper Senegambia and the Niger, formed 8 April, 1904, by the Anglo-French convention.
