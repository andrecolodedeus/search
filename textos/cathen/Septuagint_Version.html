<h1>Septuagint Version</h1>  

<p>The first translation of the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, made into popular Greek before the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> era. This article will treat of:</p>

<blockquote><p>I. Its Importance; <br>II. Its Origin:</p> <ul><li>A. According to tradition; <li>B. According to the commonly accepted view; </ul><p>III. Its subsequent history, recensions, <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, and editions; <br>IV. Its critical value; Language.</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="section1">Historical importance of the Septuagint</h2>

<p>The importance of the Septuagint Version is shown by the following considerations:

<p>(1) The Septuagint is the most ancient translation of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> and consequently is invaluable to critics for understanding and correcting the Hebrew text <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">(Massorah)</a>, the latter, such as it has come down to us, being the text established by the <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretes</a> in the sixth century A.D. Many textual corruptions, additions, omissions, or transpositions must have crept into the Hebrew text between the third and second centuries B.C. and the sixth and seventh centuries of our era; the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> therefore which the Seventy had at their disposal, may in places have been better than the <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretic</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>.

<p>(2) The Septuagint Version accepted first by the Alexandrian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and afterwards by all the Greek-speaking countries, helped to spread among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> and the expectation of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, and to introduce into Greek the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> terminology that made it a most suitable instrument for the propagation of the Gospel of Christ.

<p>(3) The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> made use of it long before the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a>, and in the time of Christ it was recognised as a legitimate text, and was employed in Palestine even by the rabbis. The Apostles and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> utilised it also and borrowed <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> citations from it, especially in regard to the prophecies. The Fathers and the other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers of the early Church drew upon it, either directly, as in the case of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, or indirectly, like the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> and writers and others who employed Latin, Syriac, <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian</a>, Arabic and Gothic versions. It was held in high esteem by all, some even believed it inspired. Consequently, a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Septuagint helps to a perfect understanding of these literatures.

<p>(4) At the present time, the Septuagint is the official text in the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, and the ancient Latin Versions used in the western church were made from it; the earliest translation adopted in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, the Vetus Itala, was directly from the Septuagint: the meanings adopted in it, the Greek names and words employed (such as: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers [<em>Arithmoi</em>], Deuteronomy), and finally, the pronunciation given to the Hebrew text, passed very frequently into the Itala, and from it, at times, into the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, which not rarely gives signs of the influence of the Vetus Itala; this is especially so in the Psalms, the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> translation being merely the Vetus Itala corrected by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> according to the hexaplar text of the Septuagint.
<h2 id="section2">Origin of the Septuagint</h2>
<h3 id="A">According to Tradition</h3>

<p>The Septuagint Version is first mentioned in a letter of <a href="../cathen/01712c.htm">Aristeas</a> to his brother Philocrates. Here, in substance, is what we read of the origin of the version. Ptolemy II Philadelphus, King of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (287-47 BC) had recently established a valuable <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. He was persuaded by Demetrius of Phalarus, chief librarian, to enrich it with a copy of the sacred books of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. To win the good <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> of this people, Ptolemy, by the advice of <a href="../cathen/01712c.htm">Aristeas</a>, an officer of the royal guard, an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> by birth and a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> by religion, emancipated 100,000 slaves in different parts of his kingdom. He then sent delegates, among whom was <a href="../cathen/01712c.htm">Aristeas</a>, to Jerusalem, to ask Eleazar, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">Jewish high-priest</a>, to provide him with a copy of the Law, and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> capable of translating it into Greek. The embassy was successful: a richly ornamented copy of the Law was sent to him and seventy-two <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, six from each tribe, were deputed to go to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and carry out the wish of the king. They were received with great honor and during seven days astonished everyone by the wisdom they displayed in answering seventy-two questions which they were asked; then they were led into the solitary island of Pharos, where they began their work, translating the Law, helping one another and comparing translations in proportion as they finished them. At the end of seventy-two days, their work was completed, The translation was read in presence of the Jewish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, princes, and people assembled at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, who all recognized and praised its perfect conformity with the Hebrew original. The king was greatly pleased with the work and had it placed in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>.

<p>Despite its legendary character, <a href="../cathen/01712c.htm">Aristeas'</a> account gained credence; Aristobulus (170-50 B.C.), in a passage preserved by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, says that "through the efforts of Demetrius of Phalerus a complete translation of the Jewish legislation was executed in the days of Ptolemy"; <a href="../cathen/01712c.htm">Aristeas's</a> story is repeated almost verbatim by <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Flavius Josephus</a> (Ant. Jud., XII, ii) and substantially, with the omission of <a href="../cathen/01712c.htm">Aristeas'</a> name, by Philo of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> (De vita Moysis, II, vi). the letter and the story were accepted as genuine by many Fathers and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers till the beginning of the sixteenth century; other details serving to emphasize the extraordinary origin of the version were added to <a href="../cathen/01712c.htm">Aristeas's</a> account" The seventy-two interpreters were inspired by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, St. Augustine, the author of the "Cohortatio ad Graecos" [<a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a>?], and others); in translating they did not consult with one another, they had even been shut up in separate cells, either singly, or in pairs, and their translations when compared were found to agree entirely both as to the sense and the expressions employed with the original text and with each other (Cohortatio ad Graecos, St. Iren&aelig;us, <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">St. Clement of Alexandria</a>). <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> rejected the story of the cells as fabulous and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a> ("Praef. in Pentateuchum"; "Adv. Rufinum", II, xxv). likewise the alleged inspiration of the Septuagint. Finally the seventy two interpreters translated, not only the five books of the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>, but the entire Hebrew <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. The authenticity of the letter, called in question first by Louis Viv&egrave;s (1492-1540), professor at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> (Ad S. August. Civ. Dei, XVIII, xlii), then by Jos. Scaliger (d. 1609), and especially by H. Hody (d. 1705) and Dupin (d. 1719) is now universally denied.


<h3>Criticism</h3>

<p>(1) The letter of <a href="../cathen/01712c.htm">Aristeas</a> is certainly <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>. The writer, who calls himself Aristeas and says he is a Greek and a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>, shows by his whole work that he is a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>: he recognizes the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">one true God</a>; he declares that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the author of the Mosaic law; he is an enthusiastic admirer of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple of Jerusalem</a>, the Jewish land and people, and its holy <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and learned men.

<p>(2) The account as given in the letter must be regarded as fabulous and legendary, at least in several parts. Some of the details, such as the official intervention of the king and the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, the number of the seventy-two translators, the seventy-two questions they had to answer, the seventy-two days they took for their work, are clearly arbitrary assertions; it is difficult, moreover, to admit that the Alexandrian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> adopted for their public worship a translation of the Law, made at the request of a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> king; lastly, the very language of the Septuagint Version betrays in places a rather imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> both of Hebrew and of the topography of Palestine, and corresponds more closely with the vulgar idiom of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. Yet it is not <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that everything contained in the letter is legendary, and scholars ask if there is not a historic foundation underneath the legendary details. Indeed it is likely &#151; as appears from the peculiar character of the language, as well as from what we know of the origin and history of the version &#151; that the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> was translated at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. It seems <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> also that it dates from the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus, and therefore from the middle of the third century B.C. For if, as is commonly believed, <a href="../cathen/01712c.htm">Aristeas's</a> letter was written about 200 B.C., fifty years after the death of Philadelphus, and with a view to increase the authority of the Greek version of the Law, would it have been accepted so easily and spread broadcast, if it had been fictitious, and if the time of the composition did not correspond with the reality? Moreover, it is possible that Ptolemy had something to do with the preparation or publishing of the translation, though how and why cannot be determined now. Was it for the purpose of enriching his <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> as Pseudo-Aristeas states? This is possible, but is not proven, while, as will be shown below, we can very well account for the origin of the version independently of the king.

<p>(3) The few details which during the course of ages have been added to <a href="../cathen/01712c.htm">Aristeas's</a> account cannot be accepted; such are the story of the cells (St. Jerome explicitly rejects this); the inspiration of the translators, an opinion certainly based on the legend of the cells; the number of the translators, seventy-two (see below); the assertion that all the Hebrew books were translated at the same time. <a href="../cathen/01712c.htm">Aristeas</a> speaks of the translation of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> (<em>nomos</em>), of the legislation (<em>nomothesia</em>), of the books of the legislator; now these expressions especially the last two, certainly mean the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>, exclusive of the other <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> books: and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (Comment. in Mich.) says: "Josephus writes, and the Hebrews inform us, that only the five books of Moses were translated by them (seventy-two), and given to King Ptolemy." Besides, the versions of the various books of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> differ so much in vocabulary, style, form, and character, sometimes free and sometimes extremely literal, that they could not be the work of the same translators. Nevertheless, in spite of these divergencies the name of the Septuagint Version is universally given to the entire collection of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> books in the Greek Bible adopted by the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>.
<h3 id="B">Origin according to the commonly accepted view</h3>

<p>As to the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> the following view seems plausible, and is now commonly accepted in its broad lines: The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in the last two centuries B.C. were so numerous in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, especially at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, that at a certain time they formed two-fifths of the entire population. Little by little most of them ceased to use and even forgot the Hebrew language in great part, and there was a danger of their forgetting the Law. Consequently it became customary to interpret in Greek the Law which was read in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, and it was quite natural that, after a time, some men <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the Law should have undertaken to compile a Greek Translation of the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>. This happened about the middle of the third century B.C. As to the other Hebrew books &#151; the prophetical and historical &#151; it was natural that the Alexandrian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, making use of the translated <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> in their <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> reunions, should desire to read the remaining books also and hence should gradually have translated all of them into Greek, which had become their maternal language; this would be so much the more likely as their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Hebrew was diminishing daily. It is not possible to determine accurately the precise time or the occasions on which these different translations were made; but it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the Law, the Prophets, and at least part of the other books, that is, the hagiographies, existed in Greek before the year 130 B.C., as appears from the prologue of Ecclesiasticus, which does not date later than that year. It is difficult also to say where the various translations were made, the data being so scanty. Judging by the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> words and expressions occurring in the version, most of the books must have been translated in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and most likely in Alexandria; Esther however was translated in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (XI, i).

<p>Who were the translators and how many? Is there any foundation for their number, seventy or seventy-two, as given in the legendary account (Brassac-Vigouroux, n. 105)? It seems impossible to decide definitely; the Talmudists tell us that the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> was translated by five interpreters (Sopherim, c.i.). History gives us no details; but an examination of the text shows that in general that the authors were not Palestinian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> called to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; and differences of terminology, method, etc. prove clearly that the translators were not the same for the different books. It is impossible also to say whether the work was carried out officially or was merely a private undertaking, as seems to have been the case with Ecclesiasticus; but the different books when translated were soon put together &#151; the author of Ecclesiasticus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the collection &#151; and were received as official by the Greek-speaking <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.
<h2 id="section3">Subsequent history</h2>
<h3>Recensions</h3>

<p>The Greek version, known as the Septuagint, welcomed by the Alexandrian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, spread quickly throughout the countries in which Greek was spoken; it was utilized by different writers, and supplanted the original text in <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> services. Philo of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> used it in his writings and looked on the translators as inspired Prophets; it was finally received even by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of Palestine, and was employed notably by <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, the Palestinian Jewish historian. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> also that the writers of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> made use of it, borrowing from it most of their citations; it became the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and was so highly esteemed by the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> that several writers and Fathers declared it to be inspired. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> had recourse to it constantly in their controversies with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who soon recognized its imperfections, and finally rejected it in favour of the Hebrew text or of more literal translations (Aquila, Theodotion).
<h3>Critical corrections of Origen, Lucian, and Hesychius</h3>

<p>On account of its diffusion alone the hellenizing <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, copies of the Septuagint were multiplied; and as might be expected, many changes, deliberate as well as involuntary, crept in. The necessity of restoring the text as far as possible to its pristine purity was felt. The following is a brief account of the attempted corrections:

<p>A. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> reproduced the Septuagint text in the fifth column of his <a href="../cathen/07316a.htm">Hexapla</a>; marking with obeli the texts that occurred in the Septuagint without being in the original; adding according to Theodotion's version, and distinguishing with asterisks and metobeli the texts of the original which were not in the Septuagint; adopting from the variants of the Greek Version the texts which were closest to the Hebrew; and, finally, transposing the text where the order of the Septuagint did not correspond with the Hebrew order. His recension, copied by <a href="../cathen/11436b.htm">Pamphilus</a> and <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, is called the hexaplar, to distinguish it from the version previously employed and which is called the common, vulgate, <em>koine</em>, or ante-hexaplar. It was adopted in Palestine.

<p>B. St. Lucien, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Antioch and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, in the beginning of the fourth century, published an edition corrected in accordance with the hebrew; this retained the name of <em>koine</em>, vulgate edition, and is sometimes called <em>Loukianos</em>, after its author. In the time of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> it was in use at Constantinople and Antioch. C. Finally, Hesychius, an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, published about the same time, a new recension, employed chiefly in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.
<h3>Manuscripts</h3>

<p>The three most celebrated <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the Septuagint known are the Vatican, <a href="../cathen/04086a.htm">"Codex Vaticanus"</a> (fourth century); the Alexandrian, <a href="../cathen/04080c.htm">"Codex Alexandrinus"</a> (fifth century), now in the British Museum, London; and that of Sinai, <a href="../cathen/04085a.htm">"Codex Sinaiticus"</a> (fourth century), found by Tischendorf in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Catherine, on <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a>, in 1844 and 1849, now part at Leipzig and in part in St. Petersburg; they are all written in uncials.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04086a.htm">"Codex Vaticanus"</a> is the purest of the three; it generally gives the more ancient text, while the <a href="../cathen/04080c.htm">"Codex Alexandrinus"</a> borrows much from the hexaplar text and is changed according to the <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretic</a> text (The <a href="../cathen/04086a.htm">"Codex Vaticanus"</a> is referred to by the letter B; the <a href="../cathen/04080c.htm">"Codex Alexandrinus"</a> by the letter A, and the <a href="../cathen/04085a.htm">"Codex Sinaiticus"</a> by the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet <em>Aleph</em> or by S). The Bibliotheque Nationale in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> possesses also an important palimpsest <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the Septuagint, the <a href="../cathen/04084a.htm">"Codex Ephraemi rescriptus"</a> (designated by the letter C), and two <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of less value (64 and 114), in cursives, one belonging to the tenth or eleventh century and the other to the thirteenth (Bacuez and Vigouroux, 12th ed., n. 109).
<h3>Printed editions</h3>

<p>All the printed editions of the Septuagint are derived from the three recensions mentioned above. <ul><li>The <em>editio princeps</em> is the Complutensian or that of Alcal&aacute;. It was from <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> hexaplar text; printer in 1514-18, it was not published till it appeared in the Polyglot of Cardinal Ximenes in 1520. <li>The Aldine edition (begun by <a href="../cathen/09633b.htm">Aldus Manucius</a>) appeared at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> in 1518. The text is purer than that of the Complutensian edition, and is closer to <a href="../cathen/04086a.htm">Codex B</a>. The editor says he collated ancient <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> but does not specify them. It has been reprinted several times. <li>The most important edition is the Roman or Sixtine, which reproduces the <a href="../cathen/04086a.htm">"Codex Vaticanus"</a> almost exclusively. It was published under the direction of Cardinal Caraffa, with the help of various savants, in 1586, by the authority of <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>, to assist the revisers who were preparing the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Latin Vulgate</a> edition ordered by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. It has become the <em>textus receptus</em> of the Greek <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> and has had many new editions, such as that of Holmes and Pearsons (Oxford, 1798-1827), the seven editions of Tischendorf, which appeared at Leipzig between 1850 and 1887, the last two, published after the death of the author and revised by Nestle, the four editions of Swete (Cambridge, 1887-95, 1901, 1909), etc. <li>Grabe's edition was published at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, from 1707 to 1720, and reproduced, but imperfectly, the <a href="../cathen/04080c.htm">"Codex Alexandrinus"</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. For partial editions, see Vigouroux, "Dict. de la Bible", 1643 sqq.</ul>
<h2 id="section4">Critical value and language</h2>
<h3>Critical value</h3>

<p>The Septuagint Version, while giving exactly as to the form and substance the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense of the Sacred Books, differs nevertheless considerably from our present Hebrew text. These discrepancies, however, are not of great importance and are only matters of interpretation. They may be thus classified: Some result from the translators having had at their disposal Hebrew recensions differing from those which were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretes</a>; sometimes the texts varied, at others the texts were identical, but they were read in different order. Other discrepancies are due to the translators personally; not to speak of the influence exerted on their work by their methods of interpretation, the inherent difficulties of the work, their greater or less <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Greek and Hebrew, they now and then translated differently from the <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretes</a>, because they read the texts differently; that was natural, for, Hebrew being written in square characters, and certain consonants being very similar in form, it was easy to confound them occasionally and so give an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> translation; moreover, their Hebrew text being written without any spacing between the various words, they could easily make a mistake in the separation of the words; finally, as the Hebrew text at their disposal contained no vowels, they might supply different vowels from those used later by the <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretes</a>. Again, we must not think that we have at present the Greek text exactly as it was written by the translators; the frequent transcriptions during the early centuries, as well as the corrections and editions of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, Lucian, and Hesychius impaired the purity of the text: <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> or involuntarily the copyists allowed many textual corruptions, transpositions, additions, and omissions to creep into the primitive text of the Septuagint. In particular we may note the addition of parallel passages, explanatory notes, or double translations caused by marginal notes. On this consult Dict. de la Bible, <em>art. cit.</em>, and Swete, "An Introduction to the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> in Greek".
<h3>Language</h3>

<p>Everyone admits that the Septuagint Version was made in popular Greek, the <em>koine dislektos</em>. But is the Greek of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> a special idiom? Many authorities assert that it is, though they disagree as to its real character. The "Dict. de la Bible", s.v. <em>Grec biblique</em>, asserts that it was "the hebraicizing Greek spoken by the Jewish community at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>", the popular Greek of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> "with a very large admixture of Hebraicisms". The same dictionary, s.v. <em>Septante</em>, mentions the more recent opinion of Deissmann that the Greek of the Septuagint is merely the ordinary vernacular Greek, the pure <em>koine</em> of the time. Deissmann bases his theory on the perfect resemblance of the language of the Septuagint and that of the papyri and the inscriptions of the same age; he believes that the syntactical peculiarities of the Septuagint, which at first sight seem to favour the theory of a special language, a hebraicizing Greek, are sufficiently explained by the fact that the Septuagint is a Greek translation of Hebrew books.
