<h1>Seraphim</h1>  

<p>The name, a Hebrew masculine plural form, designates a special class of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a> attendants of <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh's</a> court.

<p>In <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> these <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic beings</a> are distinctly mentioned only in <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaias's</a> description of his call to the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetical</a> office (<a href="../bible/isa006.htm#vrs2">Isaiah 6:2 sqq.</a>). In a vision of deep spiritual import, granted him in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple</a>, <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaias</a> beheld the invisible realities symbolized by the outward forms of <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh's</a> dwelling place, of its <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>, its <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, etc. While he stood gazing before the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> court, there arose before him an august vision of <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a> sitting on the throne of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. On each side of the throne stood mysterious guardians, each supplied with six wings: two to bear them up, two veiling their faces, and two covering their feet, now naked, as became <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> service in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty</a>. His highest servants, they were there to minister to Him and proclaim His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, each calling to the other: "<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">Holy</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>; all the earth is full of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." These were seraphim, one of which flew towards <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaias</a> bearing a live coal which he had taken from the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>, and with which he touched and purified the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">Prophet's</a> lips, that henceforth these might be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the utterances of inspiration.

<p>Such, in <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, is <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaias's</a> symbolical vision from which may be inferred all that <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> discloses concerning the seraphim. Although described under a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form, with faces, hands, and feet (<a href="../bible/isa006.htm#vrs2">Isaiah 6:2, 6</a>), they are undoubtedly existing spiritual beings corresponding to their name, and not mere symbolic representations as is often asserted by advanced <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> scholars. Their number is considerable, as they appear around the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a> throne in a double choir and the volume of their chorus is such that the sound shakes the foundations of the palace.

<p>They are distinct from the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a> who carry or veil <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and show the presence of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the earthly sanctuary, whilst the seraphim stand before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as ministering servants in the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a> court. Their name too, <em>seraphim</em>, distinguishes them from the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, although it is confessedly difficult to obtain from the single <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptural</a> passage wherein these beings are mentioned a clear conception of its precise meaning.

<p>The name is oftentimes derived from the Hebrew verb <em>saraph</em> ("to consume with fire"), and this etymology is very probable because of its accordance with <a href="../bible/isa006.htm#vrs6">Isaiah 6:6</a>, where one of the seraphim is represented as carrying celestial fire from the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a> to purify the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">Prophet's</a> lips. Many scholars prefer to derive it from the Hebrew noun <em>saraph</em>, "a fiery and flying serpent", spoken of in <a href="../bible/num021.htm#vrs6">Numbers 21:6</a>; <a href="../bible/isa014.htm#vrs29">Isaiah 14:29</a>, and the brazen image of which stood in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple</a> in <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaias's</a> <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> (<a href="../bible/2ki018.htm#vrs4">2 Kings 18:4</a>); but it is plain that no trace of such serpentine form appears in <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaias's</a> description of the seraphim. Still less probable are the views propounded of late by certain critics and connecting the <a href="../bible/index.html">Biblical</a> seraphim with the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> <em>Sharrapu</em>, a name for Nergal, the fire-god, or with the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> griffins (<em>s&eacute;r&eacute;f</em>) which are placed at Beni-Hassan as guardians of graves.

<p>The seraphim are mentioned at least twice in the Book of Enoch (lxi, 10; lxxi, 7), together with and distinctly from the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>. In <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Christian theology</a>, the seraphim occupy with the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a> the highest rank in the celestial hierarchy, while in the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a> (Te Deum; <a href="../cathen/12384a.htm">Preface</a> of the Mass) they are represented as repeating the <a href="../cathen/13432a.htm">Trisagion</a> exactly as in <a href="../bible/isa006.htm">Isaiah 6</a>.
