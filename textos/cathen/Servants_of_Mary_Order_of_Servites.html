<h1>Servants of Mary (Order of Servites)</h1>  

<p>This order was founded on the feast of the Assumption, 1233 when the Blessed Virgin appeared to seven noble Florentines, who had repaired to the church to follow the exercises of the Confraternity of the <em>Laudesi</em>, and bade them leave the world and live for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. On the following feast of her Nativity, 8 September, they retired to La Camarzia, just outside the walls of the city, and later on to Monte Senario, eleven miles from Florence. Here again they had a vision of the Blessed Virgin. In her hands she held a black habit; a multitude of angles surrounded her, some bearing the different instruments of the Passion, one holding the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>, whilst another offered with one hand a scroll, on which appeared the title of Servants of Mary surrounded by golden rays, and with the other a palm branch. She addressed to them the following words: "I have chosen you to be my first Servants, and under this name you are to till my Son's Vineyard. Here, too, is the habit which you are to wear; its dark colour will recall the pangs which I suffered on the day when I stood by the Cross of my only Son. Take also the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>, and may you, bearing the title of my Servants, obtain the palm of everlasting life." Among the holy men of the order was St. Philip Benizi, who was born on the day the Blessed Virgin first appreared to the Seven Founders (15 August), and afterwards became the great propagator of the order. The order developed rapidly not only in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> but also in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, where the holy founders themselves spread <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a> to the Sorrows of Mary. Their glorious son St. Philip continued the work and thus merited the title of Eight Founder of the Order. The distinctive spirit of the order is the sanctification of its members by meditation on the Passion of Jesus and the Sorrows of Mary, and spreading abroad this devotion.

<p>The order consists of three branches. Concerning the First Order or Servite Fathers, see <a href="../cathen/13736a.htm">S<font size=-2>ERVITE</font> O<font size=-2>RDER</font></a>. The Second Order (<a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloistered</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>) was probably founded by Blessed Helen and Blessed Rose shortly after the death of St. Philip in 1285. This branch has houses in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> as well as one at Bognor, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of Mantellate was founded by <a href="../cathen/08556a.htm">St. Juliana Falconieri</a> to whom St. Philip gave the habit in 1284. This branch occupies itself with active works after the example of its holy foundress. From <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> it spread into other countries of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The Venerable Anna Juliana, Archduchess of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, founded several houses and became a Mantellate herself. In 1844 it was introduced into <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and was thence extended into <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1850. The sisters were the first to wear the religious habit publicly in that country after the so-called <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. They are at present one of the leading <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in what was once "Mary's Dowry", having been active missionaries under Father Faber and the <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a> for many years. In 1871 the English province sent sisters to American, but they were recalled in 1875. The superior general being very desirous to see the order established in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> sent sisters a second time in 1893. They have now a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at Cherokee, <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>, and mission houses in other states. They devote themselves principally to the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth, managing academies and taking charge of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and workrooms. They also undertake works of mercy, such as the care of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, visiting the sick, and instructing converts, etc. Above all, in imitation of their holy foundress, <a href="../cathen/08555a.htm">St. Juliana</a>, they do all in their power to instill into the hearts of those under their care a great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. At the last general chapter held in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 31 July, 1906, a vicaress general for America was appointed.
