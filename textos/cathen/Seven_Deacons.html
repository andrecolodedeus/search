<h1>Seven Deacons</h1>  

<p>The seven men elected by the whole company of the original <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, their office being chiefly to look after the poor and the common <em>agape</em>. The number of believers at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> had grown very rapidly, and complaints had been made that poor <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> of Hellenistic <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were neglected. The Apostles, not desiring to be drawn away from preaching and the higher spiritual ministry to care for material things, proposed to the believers to transfer such <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> to suitable men, and following this suggestion the "Seven" were appointed (<a href="../bible/act006.htm#vrs1">Acts 6:1-6</a>). This was the first separation of an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>, hierarchical office from the Apostolate in which up to then the ecclesiastico-religious power had been concentrated. The "seven men" were "full of the Holy Ghost" and therefore able partially to represent the Apostles in more important matters referring to the spiritual life, as is seen in the case of St. Stephen at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, of St. Philip in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and elswhere. Nothing further is known of several of the seven <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, namely Nicanor, Timon, and Parmenas. Philip, who is called the "Evangelist", preached with much success in Samaria (<a href="../bible/act008.htm#vrs5">Acts 8:5 sq.</a>), so that the two Apostles Peter and John went there later to bestow the Holy Ghost on those whom he had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. He also <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the eunuch of the Queen of the Ethiopians (<a href="../bible/act008.htm#vrs26">Acts 8:26 sqq.</a>). According to the further testimony of the Book of the Acts (xxi, 8 sqq.) he lived later with his prophetically gifted daughters at Caesarea. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is observed on 6 June, by the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> on 11 October. In later narratives Prochorus is said to be one of the seventy disciples chosen by Christ; it is related that he went to <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> as a missionary and became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> Acts of John were wrongly ascribed to him [cf. Lipsius, "Apokryphe Apostelgeschichten und Apostellegenden", I (Brunswick, 1883), 355 sqq.]

<p>In the second half of the second century a curious tradition appeared respecting Nicholas. <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> and the anti-heretical writers of the early Church who follow him refer the name of the <a href="../cathen/11067a.htm">Nicolaitans</a> &#151; a dissolute, immoral <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> that are opposed, as early as the Apocalypse of John &#151; to that of Nicholas and trace the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> back to him (<a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, <a href="../fathers/0103126.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> I.26.3</a> and <a href="../fathers/0103311.htm">III.11.1</a>). Clement relates as a popular report (Stromat., II, xx) that Nicholas was reproved by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> on account of his jealousy of his beautiful wife. On this he set her free and left it open for any one to marry her, saying that the flesh should be maltreated. His followers took this to mean that it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to yield to the lusts of the flesh (cf. the Philosophumena, VII, 36). This narrative points to a similar tradition, such as is found in <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> respecting the <a href="../cathen/11067a.htm">Nicolaitans</a>. How far the tradition is historical cannot now be determined, perhaps the <a href="../cathen/11067a.htm">Nicolaitans</a> themselves falsely ascribed their origin to the Deacon Nicholas [cf. Wohlenberg, "Nikolas von Antiochen und die Nikolaiten" in the "Neue kirchl. Zeitschrift" (1895), 923 sqq.].
