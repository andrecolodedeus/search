<h1>Severian</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06328a.htm">Gabala</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, flourished in the fourth and fifth centuries. Concerning his life before his episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> nothing has come down to us. He was regarded by his contemporaries as a good preacher, and was known as the author of Biblical commentaries and sermons: "vir in divinis Scripturis eruditus et in homiilis declamator admirabilis fuit" (Gennadius, "De script. eccles.", xxi, in P.L., LVIII, 1073). Posterity has preserved his name on account of the prominent but regrettable role which he played in the deposition and banishment of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>. Incited by the great oratorical and financial success attained in Constantinople by his fellow-Syrian, Antiochus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ptolemais, Severian came to the capital about 400 provided with a series of Greek sermons. Invited by <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> to preach, he succeeded, in spite of his strong Syrian accent, in winning the approval of his hearers (<a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, "Hist eccl.", VIII, x). Owing to the strained relations between <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> and the Empress Eudoxia, Severian had to declare for one of the parties, and, since he allowed himself to be swayed by personal interests, his choice was soon made. Nevertheless, the unsuspecting <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, when <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs necessitated a journey into the Province of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> in 401, appointed his guest his representative for <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> functions. Severian took advantage of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom's</a> absence and was soon engaged in open conflict with Serapion, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> and administrator of the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> and the episcopal palace, who remained true to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>. The resulting <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> and general excitement were so great that on his return (401) <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> requested Severian to return again to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (<a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, "Hist.eccl.", VI, xi; the longer version, ibid. in P.G., LXVII, 731). Eudoxia now interfered personally, and at her request <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> allowed Severian to return to Constantinople. In this place <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> delivered in Severian's presence an address to the people (P.G., LII, 423 sqq.; Severian's answer, ibid., 425 sqq.; cf. <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, <a href="../fathers/26016.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.11</a>; <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, <a href="../fathers/26028.htm"><em>Church History</em> VIII.10</a>).

<p>The peace thus effected was not lasting. Severian commenced anew his intrigues, and at the Synod of the Oak was one of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom's</a> most active opponents. He also signed the lampoon against <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> which <a href="../cathen/14625b.htm">Theophilus of Alexandria</a> sent to <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Pope Innocent</a> (Palladius, "Dialogus", III, in P.G., XLVII, 14). He even ventured to proclaim to the people from the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> this success of his party immediately after the first banishment of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, and to proclaim the removal of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> a just punishment for his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Rapid flight alone saved him from <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> at the hands of the enraged populace (<a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, VIII, xviii). Shortly after <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom's</a> return from his first exile, we find Severian with <a href="../cathen/01080a.htm">Acacius of Beroea</a> and Antiochus of Ptolemais at the head of the party opposed to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. It was this party which on the night of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a>, 404, incited the attack on the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, and finally approached the emperor directly to procure the final banishment of their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> opponent (Palladius, III, IX, loc. cit., 14, 31 sqq.). On the death of Flavian (404), the friend of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, this same triumvirate proceeded to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and, in defiance of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and right, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in an underhanded fashion Porphyrius (<a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom's</a> opponent) <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> (Palladius, XVI, loc. cit., 54). Thus ends Severian's role in <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>. Of the later period of his life and activity, as little is known as concerning the first period. According to <a href="../cathen/06417a.htm">Gennadius</a> (loc. cit.) he died during the reign of Theodosius II (408-50).
