<h1>Seville</h1>  

<p>ARCHDIOCESE OF SEVILLE (HISPALENSIS).

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, is bounded on the north by <a href="../cathen/02193a.htm">Badajoz</a>; on the east by Cordova and Malaga, on the south by Cadiz, on the west by <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. It comprises portions of the civil provinces of Seville, <a href="../cathen/03131b.htm">Cadiz</a>, <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>, Huelva, and <a href="../cathen/09565b.htm">Malaga</a>. Its episcopal city has a population of some 144,000. Its suffragans are <a href="../cathen/02193a.htm">Badajoz</a>, <a href="../cathen/03131b.htm">Cadiz</a> and Ceuta, the Canaries, <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14507a.htm">Teneriffe</a>.

<p>In Roman times Seville was the capital of the Province of Baetica, and the origin of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> goes back to Apostolic times, or at least to the first century of our era. St. Gerontius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Italica (about four miles from Hispalis or Seville), preached in Baetica in Apostolic times, and without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> must have left a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of its own to Seville. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that in 303, when Sts. Justa and Rufina, the potters, suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> for refusing to adore the idol Salambo, there was a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Seville, Sabinus, who assisted at the Council of Iliberis (287). Before that time Marcellus had been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as appears from a catalogue of the ancient <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of Seville preserved in the &quot;Codex Emilianensis&quot;, a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the year 1000, now in the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a>. When Constantine brought peace to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Evodius was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Seville; he set himself to rebuild the ruined churches, among them he appears to have built the church of San Vicente, perhaps the first <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Seville. In the time of Bishop Sempronius Seville was considered the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of Baetica; and Glaucius was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> when the barbarians invaded <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Marcianus was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 428, when Gunderic wished to seize the treasures of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Vicente; Sabinus II was dispossessed of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> by Rechila the Suevian (441) and recovered it in 461. Zeno (472-486) was appointed <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> by <a href="../cathen/14002a.htm">Pope Simplicius</a>, and Pope Hormisdas gave the same charge to Bishop Sallustius (510-22) in the provinces of Baetica and Lusitania. But the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was rendered illustrious above all by the holy brothers Sts. Leander and Isidore. The former of these contributed to the conversion of <a href="../cathen/07276a.htm">St. Hermengild</a> and Recared, and presided at the Third Council of Toledo (589), while the latter presided at the Fourth Council of Toledo and was the teacher of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. A very different kind of celebrity was attained by Archbishop Oppas, who usurped the See of Toledo and conspired with his nephews, the sons of Witiza, against Don Rodrigo, contributing by his treason to the disaster of Guadalete and the downfall of the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> power. During that period two provincial councils of Baetica were held at Seville: the first, in the reign of Recared, in 590, assembled in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> to urge the execution of the mandates of the Third Council of Toledo; the second, in November, 690, in the reign of Sisebut, was convoked and presided over by St. Isidore, to promote <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>. The succession of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Seville continued after the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> conquest, Nonnitus being elected on the death of Oppas. The lost Mozarabic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Clement, elected two years before the invasion of the Almohades (1144). The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion was confined to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> Church of S. Ildefonso, until the restoration following the reconquest of the city by St. Ferdinand. After a siege of fifteen months, the holy king took the city on 23 Nov., 1248; and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>, Gutierre de Olea, purified the great mosque and prepared it for Divine worship on 22 December. The king deposited in the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> two famous images of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>: &quot;Our Lady of the Kings&quot;, an <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> to which a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> origin was attributed, and which St. Ferdinand always carried with him in battle on his saddle bow; and the silver image, &quot;Our Lady of the See&quot;. The king's son Philip was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Seville, while he was given as coadjutor the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Raimundo de Losada, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13684b.htm">Segovia</a>, who became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> five years later, on the abdication of the <em>infante</em>. In addition to the cathedral chapter, another community of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> was formed to sing the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> in the Chapel Royal of Our Lady of the Kings (Nuestra Senora de los Reyes) about 1252. Most of the other mosques of the city were converted into churches, only Sta. Mar&iacute;a la Blanca, Sta. Cruz, and S. Bartolome being left to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> for <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> originated in the great mosque which was the work of the emirs who built the Aljama mosque, rebuilt in 1171 by the Almohad emir, Yusuf-ben Yacub. The famous tower called the Giralda is due to Almanzor. In order to secure the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> orientation, when the mosque was converted into a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> its width was made the length of the new church; and it was divided into two parts, the lesser part, on the cast, being separated from the rest by a balustrade and grating, to form the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> royal.

<p>This <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> having become too small for Seville, the chapter resolved in 1401 to rebuild it on so vast a scale that posterity should deem it the work of madmen. Only the Giralda and the Court of Oranges were left as they were. The work was commenced in 1403 and finished in December, 1506. The <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a> was as high as the lower part of the Giralda; it fell in, however, 111 1511, and was restored by Juan Gil de Montanon in 1517. The principal <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>, which looks to the east, extends the whole width of the building, and is as high as the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a>, to which its five divisions correspond. The decoration of the upper part, including the <a href="../cathen/15653a.htm">rose window</a>, are eighteenth-century work. The plan of the building is a rectangle, 380 by 250 feet, the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> royal projecting an additional 62 feet to the east. It is roofed with seventy ogival vaults, supported by thirty-two gigantic columns. In the windows above the door of the <a href="../cathen/02394d.htm">bell-tower</a> is preserved the original design of the Giralda, which, it is said, was constructed by Geber, to whom are attributed the invention of algebra, and the origin of the name (Al-Geber). Where the bell-chamber now is there stood another rectangular mass, surmounted with four enormous balls, or apples, of bronze. In the interior is an enormous spike which serves as an axis from which thirty-five sloping planes radiate. In 1568 Fern&aacute;n Ruiz, by order of the chapter, added ninety-two feet to the height of the tower giving it its present form, and setting up the giraidillo, gyrating <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Faith, which serves as a wind-vane. This <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, cast by Bartolome Morel, measures over 13 feet in height and weighs 28 quintals (about 2840 lb.). The magnificent reredos of the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> was designed by Danchart in 1482 and is the largest in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> beyond it are preserved the &quot;Alphonsine Tables&quot; (<em>Tablas Alfonsinas</em>), a <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> left by the Wise King. The splendid stalls of the choir are the work of Nufro S&aacute;nchez, who wrought them in 1475. The Plateresque screen which closes the front of the sanctuary was designed by Sancho Mu&ntilde;oz in 1510. The <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of S. Antonio holds <a href="../cathen/10644a.htm">Murillo's</a> famous picture of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> and the Infant <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> descending into his arms. The <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> royal contains the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of St. Ferdinand, Alfonso the Wise, and Beatriz, consort of the latter, while in the pantheon, behind the sanctuary, lie the remains of Pedro I, his son Juan, the Infante Fadrique, Alfonso XI, and other princes.

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the Alc&aacute;zar is the most noteworthy building in Seville. No other <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> building in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> has been so well preserved. Inhabited for a time by the Abbatid, Almoravid, and Almohad kings, its embattled enclosure became the dwelling of St. Ferdinand, and was rebuilt by Pedro the Cruel (1353-64), who employed <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granadans</a> and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> subjects of his own (<em>mudejares</em>) as its architects. Its principal entrance, with <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>, is in the Plaza de la Monteria, once occupied by the dwellings of the hunters (<em>monteros</em>) of Espinosa. The principal features of the Alcazar are the Court of the Ladies, brilliantly restored by Carlos I, with its fifty-two uniform columns of white marble supporting interlaced arches, and its gallery of precious arabesques; and the Hall of Ambassadors, which, with its <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a>, dominates the rest of the building, and the walls of which are covered with beautiful <em>azulejos</em> (glazed tiles) and <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> decorations. The <a href="../cathen/13746a.htm">University of Seville</a> was founded by Archdeacon Rodrigo Fernandez de Santaella, in virtue of an ordinance of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Sovereigns <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 22 Feb., 1502, and two <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>, of 1505 and 1506. It could not compete, however, with the powerful institutions of Salamanca and Alcal&aacute;. The same Archdeacon Santaella founded the Colegio Mayor, or &quot;Great College&quot; called the Maese Rodrigo. Carlos III took away the general studies from this college, ordering them to be transferred, in 1771, to the professed house of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> expelled by him.

<p>Among the churches of Seville those worthy of mention are: Santa Ana en Triana, thirteenth-century Gothic, built by order of Alfonso X; S. Andres, which preserves some considerable traces of the mosque it originally was; S. Esteban, with its <em>mudejar</em> door and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Zuraran; S. Ildefonso, perhaps the oldest church in Seville, dating, like S. Isidoro and the formerly Mozarabic church of S. Julian, from the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> period. S. Lorenzo possesses the &quot;Christ carrying the Cross&quot; of <a href="../cathen/10520a.htm">Juan Marti&ntilde;&eacute;z Monta&ntilde;&eacute;s</a> which is called <em>el Gran Poder</em> (the Great Power). Other churches are the Magdalena, S. Marcos, Sta. Marina, S. Martin, S. Nicolas, etc. The picture gallery contains more <a href="../cathen/10644a.htm">Murillos</a> than any other gallery in the world; indeed, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this master it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to visit Seville. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> palace (seventeenth-century) has a fine Plateresque doorway. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a>, first established at San L&uacute;car de Barrameda, in 1830 in the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopate</a> of Cardinal Francisco Javier de Cienfuegos y Jovellanos, was transferred to Seville in 1848, under Archbishop Judas Jos&eacute; Romo, and established in the Plaza de Maese Rodrigo; it now occupies the palace of San Telmo, which belongs to the dukes of Montpensier. The Archives of the Indies, preserved in Casa Lonja, contain immense treasures in the way of documents for the history of early Spanish missions in America and Oceania. Among the benevolent institutions are the Hospital of Las Cinco Llag&aacute;s (or La Sangre), that of S. L&aacute;zaro that of El Cristo de los Dolores etc.
