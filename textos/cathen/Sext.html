<h1>Sext</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Meaning, symbolism, and origin</h2>

<p>The <em>hora sexta</em> of the Romans corresponded closely with our noon. Among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> it was already regarded, together with <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">Terce</a> and None, as an hour most favourable to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. In the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> we read that St. Peter went up to the higher parts of the house to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> (x, 9). It was the middle of the day, also the usual hour of rest, and in consequence for devout men, an occasion to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as were the morning and evening hours. The <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> dwell constantly on the symbolism of this hour; their teaching is merely summarized here: it is treated at length in <a href="../cathen/02645b.htm">Cardinal Bona's</a> work on psalmody (ch. viii). Noon is the hour when the sun is at its full, it is the image of Divine splendour, the plenitude of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the time of grace; at the sixth hour Abraham received the three <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, the image of the Trinity; at the sixth hour <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> ate the fatal apple. We should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> at noon, says <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, because that is the time when the Divine light is in its fulness (In Ps. cxviii, vers. 62). <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, St. Augustine, and several others regard this hour as favourable to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Lastly and above all, it was the hour when Christ was nailed to the Cross; this memory excelling all the others left a still visible trace in most of the liturgy of this hour.

<p>All these mystic reasons and traditions, which indicate the sixth hour as a culminating point in the day, a sort of pause in the life of affairs, the hour of repast, could not but exercise an influence on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, inducing them to choose it as an hour of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. As early as the third century the hour of Sext was considered as important as <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">Terce</a> and None as an hour of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> speaks of these three hours of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> (<a href="../fathers/02108.htm"><em>Stromata</em> VIII.7</a>), as does <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> ("De orat.", xxiii-xv, P.L., I, 1191-93). Long previous the "Didache" had spoken of the sixth hour in the same manner (Funk, "Doctrina XII Apostolorum", V, XIV, XV). <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, the "Canons of Hippolytus", and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> express the same tradition (cf. B&#228;umer, "Hist. du br&eacute;viaire", I, 68, 69, 73, 75, 186, etc.). It is therefore evident that the custom of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> at the sixth hour was well-established in the third century and even in the second century or at the end of the first. But probably most of these texts refer to private <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. In the fourth century the hour of Sext was widely established as a canonical hour. The following are very explicit examples. In his <a href="../cathen/02322a.htm">rule</a> <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> made the sixth hour an hour of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> ("Regul&aelig; fusius tractat&aelig;", P.G., XXXI, 1013, sq., 1180), Cassian treats it as an hour of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> generally recognized in his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> (Instit. Coenob., III, iii, iv). The "De virginitate" wrongly attributed to <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>, but in any case <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the fourth century, speaks of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of Sext as do also the "Apostolic Constitutions", St. Ephrem, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> (for the texts see B&#228;umer, op. cit., I, 131, 145, 152, etc., and Leclercq, in "Dict. d'arch. chr&eacute;t.", s.v. Br&eacute;viaire). But this does not prove that the observance of Sext, any more than Prime, <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">Terce</a>, None, or even the other hours, was universal. Discipline on this point varied widely according to regions and Churches. And in fact some countries may be mentioned where the custom was introduced only later. That the same variety prevailed in the formul&aelig; of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is shown in the following paragraph.
<h2 id="section2">Variety of prayers and formulae</h2>

<p>Despite its antiquity the hour of Sext never had the importance of those of Vigils, <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>. It must have been of short duration. The oldest testimonies mentioned seem to refer to a short <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of a private nature. In the fourth and the following centuries the texts which speak of the compositions of this Office are far from uniform. Cassian tells us that in Palestine three psalms were recited for Sext, as also for <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">Terce</a> and None (Instit., III, ii). This number was adopted by the Rules of St. Benedict, Columbanus, St. Isidore, St. Fructuosus, and to a certain extent by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. However, Cassian says that in some provinces three psalms were said at <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">Terce</a>, six at Sext, and nine at None. Others recited six psalms at each hour and this custom became general among the Gauls (cf. <a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>-<a href="../cathen/09109a.htm">Leclercq</a>, "Hist. des conciles", III, 189; Leclercq, loc. cit., 1296, 1300; Mart&#232;ne, "De antiq. eccl. ritibus", III, 20; IV, 27). In Mart&#232;ne will be found the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of variations in different Churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. With regard to ancient times the "Peregrinatio Sylvi&aelig;", tells us that at the hour of Sext all assembled in the Anastasis where psalms and anthems were recited after which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> came and blessed the people (cf. Cabrol, "&#201;tude sur la Peregrinatio", Paris, 1895, 45-46). The number of psalms is not stated. In the sixth century the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a> gives the detailed composition of this Office. We quote it here because it is almost the same as the Roman Liturgy; either the latter borrowed from St. Benedict, or St. Benedict was inspired by the Roman usage. Sext, like <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">Terce</a> and None, was composed at most of three psalms, of which the choice was fixed, the Deus in adjutorium, a <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>, a lesson (capitulum), a versicle, the <a href="../cathen/08714a.htm">Kyrie Eleison</a>, and the customary concluding <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and dismissal (xvii, cf. xviii).

<p>In the Roman liturgy Sext is also composed of the Deus in adjutorium, a <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>, three portions of <a href="../bible/psa118.htm">Psalm 118</a>, the lesson, the short response, the versicle, and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> Sext is composed like the lesser hours of two parts; the first includes Pss. liii, liv, xc, with invitatory, tropes, and conclusion. The second, of Mesarion which is very similar to the first, consists of Pss. lv, lvi, and lxix. In the modern Mozarabic Office Sext consists only of <a href="../bible/psa053.htm">Psalm 53</a>, three "octonaries" of <a href="../bible/psa118.htm">Psalm 118</a>, two lessons, the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>, the supplication, the capitulum, the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Pater Noster</a>, and the benediction.
