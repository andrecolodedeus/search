<h1>Shammai</h1>  

<p>(Called <em>ha-Zekan</em>, "the Elder").

<p>A famous Jewish scribe who together with <a href="../cathen/07354c.htm">Hillel</a> made up the last of "the pairs" (<em>z&uacute;g&oacute;th</em>), or, as they are sometimes <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> named, "presidents and vice-presidents" of the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Shammai and <a href="../cathen/07354c.htm">Hillel</a> held rival sway, according to Talmudic tradition (Shabbath 15a), from about a hundred years before the destruction of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (A.D. 70). Comparatively little is known about either of the great scribes. The Mischna, the only trustworthy authority in this matter, mentions Shammai in only eight passages (Maaser sheni, II, 4, 9; Orla, II, 5; Eduyoth I, 1-4, 10, II; Aboth, I, 12, 15, V, 17; Kelim, XXII, 4; Nidda, I, 1). He was the very opposite of <a href="../cathen/07354c.htm">Hillel</a> in character and teaching. Stern and severe in living the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to the letter, he was strict to an extreme in legal interpretation. The tale tells that, on the feast of the Tabernacles, his daughter-in-law gave birth to a child; straightway Shammai had the roof broken through and the bed covered over with boughs, so that the child might celebrate the feast in an improvised <em>sukka</em> (tent or booth) and might not fail of keeping the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of Leviticus (xxiii, 42).

<p>The strictness of the master characterizes the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Shammai as opposed to that of <a href="../cathen/07354c.htm">Hillel</a>. The difference between the two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> had regard chiefly to the interpretation of the first, second, third and fifth parts of the "Mishna" &mdash; i.e. to religious dues, the keeping of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> and of holy days, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> in regard to marriage and purification. The law, for example, to prepare no food on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> had to be observed by not allowing even the beast to toil; hence it was argued that an egg laid on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> might not be eaten (Eduyoth, iv, 1). Another debate was whether, on a holy day, a ladder might be borne from one dove-cote to another or should only be glided from hole to hole. The need of fringes to a linen night-dress was likewise made a matter of difference between the two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (Eduyoth, iv, 10). In these and many other discussions we find much straining out of gnats and swallowing of camels (<a href="../bible/mat023.htm#vrs24">Matthew 23:24</a>), much pain taken to push the Mosaic law to an unbearable extreme, and no heed given to the practical reform which was really needed in Jewish <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. It was the method of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Shammai rather than that of <a href="../cathen/07354c.htm">Hillel</a> which Christ condemned. On this account non-Catholic scholars generally make Him out to have belonged to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/07354c.htm">Hillel</a>. This opinion has been shared in by a few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> (Gigot, "General Introduction to the Study of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>", New York, 1900, p. 422). Most <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetes</a>, however, refuse to admit that Christ belonged to any of the fallible Jewish <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of interpretation. He established His own <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> &mdash; to wit, the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> teaching body to which He gave the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> to have and to keep and to interpret to all nations without <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.
