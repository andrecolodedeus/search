<h1>Sherborne Abbey</h1>  

<p>Located in Dorsetshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; founded in 998. Sherborne (<em>scir-burne</em>, clear brook) was originally the episcopal seat of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Western Wessex, having been established as such by <a href="../cathen/01280b.htm">St. Aldhelm</a> (705). The <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Benedictine Rule</a> was introduced by Bishop Wulfsy III, who also governed the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> forming his chapter. The office of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was, however, separated from that of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by Roger of Caen (1122), when the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was removed to Sarum, and the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church ceased to hold <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> rank. The original <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxon</a> Church of St. Aldhelm having become too small, Bishop Roger replaced it by a larger Norman one, and this was subsequently so rebuilt and altered, that it is now almost entirely perpendicular in style. A Lady-chapel was added in the thirteenth century, and later on a great restoration was commenced by Abbot John Brunyng (1415-1436), and continued by his successor William Bradford. A <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church had previously been erected at the west end of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, but there were continual quarrels between the parishioners and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, because this Church of All-Hallows had not the proper status of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, and remained the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Their differences led to serious disturbances which were eventually settled through the intervention of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. A great fire occurred in 1437, said to have been <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by a parishioner, and this may perhaps have necessitated more rebuilding than had been originally contemplated. At the dissolution of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (1536) the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and its lands were bought by Sir John Horsey, <a href="../cathen/08670a.htm">Knight</a>, from whom the parishioners purchased the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church for the sum of &pound;300, and since two churches were not now needed, that of All-Hallows, about which there had been so much contention, was forth with demolished. The conventual buildings, chiefly of the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries, were handed over to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, which had existed there since 705, and which in 1550 was refounded, receiving a new charter from Edward VI. These buildings have been added to from time to time, and Sherborne School now ranks amongst the leading public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church remains the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of the town, having been judiciously restored in recent years. Though Norman in plan, its perpendicular work is unusually fine, and the fan-vaulting of the choir absolutely unrivaled.
