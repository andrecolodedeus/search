<h1>Sherbrooke</h1>  

<p>(S<font size=-2>HERBROOKIENSIS</font>).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>, suffragan of the <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Archdiocese of Montreal</a>, erected by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, 28 Aug., 1874, formed of parts of the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a>, St. Hyacinthe, and Quebec, and including that part of the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a> known as the Eastern Townships, renowned for the fertility of their soil, for their industry, and commerce. At present it comprises 74 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. The first missionaries who visited the territory now within the limits of the Diocese of Sherbrooke were Rev. Jean Raymbault (1816-23), John Holmes (1823-27), Michael Power (1827-31), Hugh Paisley (1831-32), Hubert Robson (1832-34). The last three died, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, attending the fever-stricken <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> in 1847. From 1834 till 1874 a great many missionaries labored with indefatigable <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> attending the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, which was thinly scattered over this immense tract of land. Roads in many places were unknown, and the missionaries had to travel on horseback or on foot, through dense forests infested with wolves, bears, and other savage animals.
<h2>Bishops of Sherbrooke</h2>
<h3 id="A">Antoine Racine</h3>

<p>Born at St. Ambrose, Quebec, 26 Jan., 1822; <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at Quebec, 12 Sept., 1844; elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sherbrooke, 1 Sept., 1874; <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/14462b.htm">Cardinal Taschereau</a>, 18 Oct., 1874; governed the See of Sherbrooke during nineteen years, d. 17 July, 1893. The following extract from his funeral oration, delivered by <a href="../cathen/11293b.htm">Mgr. Bernard O'Reilly</a>, gives us an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> this good <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> fulfilled in his career: "Yes, I must be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> without stain or blemish in my whole life; a man adorned with every virtue, and with all the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> of wisdom; a man modest, affable and of the most perfect moderation in his lofty dignity; a man who is an enemy to contestation and trouble, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of peace and conciliation; a man who is a stranger to self-interest and generous toward the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the poor; a man full of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, of the unction of the Divine Word in all his pastoral teaching; a man solely intent on sanctifying his people, on rearing a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of model <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> by giving them in his own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> the example of the most edifying <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and of a shining <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>".
<h3 id="B">Paul S. La Rocque</h3>

Bishop La Rocque has continued the good work undertaken by his predecessor, and Sherbrooke is progressing wonderfully.
