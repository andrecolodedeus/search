<h1>Shrewsbury</h1>  

<p>(SALOPIENSIS).

<p>One of the thirteen <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> created by Apostolic Letter of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> on 27 Sept., 1850. It then comprised the English counties of Shropshire and Cheshire, and the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> counties of Carnarvon, Flint, Denbigh, Merioneth, Montgomery, and Anglesey. When on 4 March, 1895, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> formed the Vicariate of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, these <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> counties were separated from this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, so that now only Shropshire and Cheshire are under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Shrewsbury. Before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, Cheshire and the portion of Shropshire north and east of the River Severn were under the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Coventry and Lichfield, and the rest of Shropshire was under the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a>. On the creation of the <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Diocese of Chester</a> by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, Cheshire was withdrawn from the old Diocese of Coventry and <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a>. When <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Pope Innocent XI</a> in 1688 divided <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> into four vicariates, Shropshire was in the Midland, and Cheshire in the Northern District, and when eight vicariates were formed by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> in 1840, Shropshire was part of the Central District, and Cheshire part of the Lancashire District. The diocese takes its name from Shrewsbury, the county town of Shropshire, and is under the patronage of <a href="../cathen/11360c.htm">Our Lady Help of Christians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15656a.htm">St. Winefride</a>. The latter saint was chosen because her body had been translated from Gwytherin, in Denbighshire, to Shrewsbury in 1138, and deposited with great honor and solemnity in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> founded by Roger, Earl of Montgomery, in 1083, where it remained until her shrine was plundered at the dissolution of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was James Brown (1812-81), president of Sedgeley Park School, who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 27 July, 1851. Out of a total population of 1,082,617, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> numbered about 20,000. There were 30 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> attended by resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 6 stations; 1 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, that of the Faithful Companions of Jesus, in Birkenhead, to which was attached a boarding-school for young ladies, and also a small day-school for poor children. There were <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at <a href="../cathen/07438a.htm">Holywell</a>, who also had a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno's</a>, Flintshire, and a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> at Acton Burnell. When Dr. Brown celebrated the jubilee of his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> had increased to 66, and the regulars to 32. Instead of one <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious house</a> of men and one of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, there were now four of men, and nine of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; and many elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> had been provided for the needs of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children. In 1852 the bitter feeling caused by-the re-establishment of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> found vent in serious riots at Stockport. On 29 June a large mob attacked the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Sts. Philip and James; they broke the windows and attempted to force in the doors, but before they could effect an entrance, Canon Randolph Frith, the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, succeeded in removing the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, and secreting It with the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalices</a>, etc., in a small cupboard in the side <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. He was compelled to flee immediately to the belltower, and, whilst the rabble were destroying whatever they could <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">lay their hands</a> upon, he made his escape along the roof, and descended by the spouting at the back of the presbytery. Much of the church furniture, with vestments, etc., was piled up in the street and burned. At St. Michael's, the Host was <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecrated</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a> and <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a> carried away.

<p>On the death of Dr. Brown, Right Rev. Edmund Knight (1827-1905), who was auxiliary from 1879, was translated to this see 25 April, 1882, and, on his resignation in May, 1895, was succeeded by Right Rev. John Carroll (1838-97), who had been coadjutor since 1893. He was followed by Right Rev. Samuel Webster Allen (1844-1908), who ruled the diocese from 1897 till his death in 1908. His valuable <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> on Egyptology, his favorite study, was bequeathed to the new <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> foundation at Cowley College, <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">Oxford</a>. The present ruler of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, 1911, is Right Rev. Hugh Singleton (b. 1851).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is now 58,013, Shropshire contributing under 3000, partly on account of agricultural depression and the consequent flocking to industrial centres. There are 90 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, 16 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, representatives of 4 orders of men, 8 secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls, an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> and industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys, a home for aged poor, a home for penitents, and soon there is to be an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> erected in memory of Bishop Knight. At Oakwood Hall, Romiley, a house of retreats for working-men has been opened and has already done important work; and at New Brighton, the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of Our Lady of the Cenacle have opened a house of retreats for working-women and ladies. Shropshire is singularly rich in archeological interest, its pre-Reformation <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, the noble ruins of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> round the Wrekin, the Roman city of Uriconium (Wroxeter), the lordly castle of Ludlow, giving the county a place apart in the heart of the antiquary. In Shrewsbury itself, where once Grey, Black, and Austin Friars and the Black Monks of St. Benedict had foundations, there is now a beautiful little <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, built by E. Welby Pugin. Chester, too, with its quaint streets, black and white houses, and venerable <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and city walls, claims the visitor's attention. When the body of Daniel O'Connell was brought back from <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, it rested in the old <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in Queen's Street on its way to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>.
