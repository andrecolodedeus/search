<h1>Shrine of Guadalupe</h1>  

<p><em>Guadalupe</em> is strictly the name of a picture, but was extended to the church containing the picture and to the town that grew up around. The word is Spanish Arabic, but in <a href="../cathen/10250b.htm">Mexico</a> it may represent certain <a href="../cathen/02169b.htm">Aztec</a> sounds.

<p>The place, styled Guadalupe Hidalgo since 1822 &#151; as in our 1848 treaty &#151; is three miles northeast of <a href="../cathen/10269a.htm">Mexico City</a>. Pilgrimages have been made to this shrine almost uninterruptedly since 1531-32. In the latter year there was a shrine at the foot of Tepeyac Hill which served for ninety years, and still, in part, forms the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>. In 1622 a rich shrine was erected; a newer one, much richer, in 1709. Other structures of the eighteenth century connected with it are a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and church for <a href="../cathen/03320a.htm">Capuchin nuns</a>, a well <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and a hill <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. About 1750 the shrine got the title of collegiate, a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> and choir service being established. It was aggregated to <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">St. John Lateran</a> in 1754; and finally, in 1904 it was created a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a>. The presiding ecclesiastic is called <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. The greatest recent change in the shrine itself has been its complete interior renovation in gorgeous <a href="../cathen/03094a.htm">Byzantine</a>, presenting a striking illustration of Guadalupan history.

<p>The picture really constitutes Guadalupe. It makes the shrine: it occasions the devotion. It is taken as representing the <a href="../cathen/07674d.htm">Immaculate Conception</a>, being the lone figure of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> with the sun, moon, and star accompaniments of the great apocalyptic sign, and in addition a supporting <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> under the crescent. Its tradition is, as the new <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> lessons declare, "long-standing and constant". Oral and written, Indian and Spanish, the account is unwavering. To a <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophyte</a>, fifty five years old, named Juan Diego, who was hurrying down Tepeyac hill to hear <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> in <a href="../cathen/10269a.htm">Mexico City</a>, on Saturday, 9 December, 1531, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> appeared and sent him to <a href="../cathen/15767a.htm">Bishop Zum&aacute;rraga</a> to have a temple built where she stood. She was at the same place that evening and Sunday evening to get the <a href="../cathen/15767a.htm">bishop's</a> answer. He had not immediately believed the messenger; having cross-questioned him and had him watched, he finally bade him ask a sign of the lady who said she was the mother of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">true God</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophyte</a> agreed so readily to ask any sign desired, that the <a href="../cathen/15767a.htm">bishop</a> was impressed and left the sign to the apparition. Juan was occupied all Monday with Bernardino, an uncle, who seemed dying of fever. Indian specifics failed; so at daybreak on Tuesday, 12 December, the grieved nephew was running to the St. James's <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> for a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. To avoid the apparition and untimely message to the <a href="../cathen/15767a.htm">bishop</a>, he slipped round where the well <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> now stands. But the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> crossed down to meet him and said: "What road is this thou takest son?" A tender dialogue ensued. Reassuring Juan about his uncle whom at that instant she cured, appearing to him also and calling herself Holy Mary of Guadalupe she bade him go again to the <a href="../cathen/15767a.htm">bishop</a>. Without hesitating he joyously asked the sign. She told him to go up to the rocks and gather roses. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it was neither the time nor the place for roses, but he went and found them. Gathering many into the lap of his <em>tilma</em> a long cloak or wrapper used by Mexican Indians he came back. The Holy Mother, rearranging the roses, bade him keep them untouched and unseen till he reached the <a href="../cathen/15767a.htm">bishop</a>. Having got to the presence of <a href="../cathen/15767a.htm">Zum&aacute;rraga</a>, Juan offered the sign. As he unfolded his cloak the roses fell out, and he was startled to see the <a href="../cathen/15767a.htm">bishop</a> and his attendants kneeling before him: the life size figure of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mother</a>, just as he had described her, was glowing on the poor <em>tilma</em>. A great mural decoration in the renovated basilica commemorates the scene. The picture was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>, guarded in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and soon after carried processionally to the preliminary shrine.

<p>The coarsely woven stuff which bears the picture is as thin and open as poor sacking. It is made of vegetable fibre, probably <em>maguey</em>. It consists of two strips, about seventy inches long by eighteen wide, held together by weak stitching. The seam is visible up the middle of the figure, turning aside from the face. Painters have not understood the laying on of the colours. They have deposed that the "canvas" was not only unfit but unprepared; and they have marvelled at apparent oil, water, distemper, etc. colouring in the same figure. They are left in equal admiration by the flower-like tints and the abundant gold. They and other artists find the proportions perfect for a maiden of fifteen. The figure and the attitude are of one advancing. There is flight and rest in the eager supporting <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. The chief colours are deep gold in the rays and stars, blue green in the mantle, and rose in the flowered tunic. Sworn evidence was given at various commissions of inquiry corroborating the traditional account of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> origin and influence of the picture. Some wills connected with Juan Diego and his contemporaries were accepted as documentary evidence. Vouchers were given for the existence of <a href="../cathen/15767a.htm">Bishop Zum&aacute;rraga's</a> letter to his <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> brethren in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> concerning the apparitions. His successor, Montufar, instituted a canonical inquiry, in 1556, on a sermon in which the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and people were abused for crowing to the new shrine. In 1568 the renowned historian <a href="../cathen/04776b.htm">Bernal D&iacute;az</a>, a companion of <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Cortez</a>, refers incidentally to Guadalupe and its daily <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. The lay viceroy, Enr&iacute;quez, while not opposing the devotion, wrote in 1575 to <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II</a> asking him to prevent the third <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> from erecting a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at the shrine; inaugural <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> were usually made to it by viceroys and other chief magistrates. Processes, national and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>, were laboriously formulated and attested for presentation at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in 1663, 1666, 1723, 1750.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a>, has been remarkably faithful to the devotion towards Our Lady of Guadalupe, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> especially fostering it, even to the extent of making a protestation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> a matter of occasional <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">present pontiff</a> [1910] is the nineteenth <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to favour the shrine and its tradition. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> and <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> were its two strongest supporters. The former <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> decreed that Our Lady of Guadalupe should be the national patron, and made 12 December a holiday of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> with an octave, and ordered a special <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> and <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a>; the latter approved a complete historical second <a href="../cathen/11087b.htm">Nocturne</a>, ordered the picture to be <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> in his name, and composed a poetical inscription for it. <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> has recently permitted Mexican <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to say the Mass of Holy Mary of Guadalupe on the twelfth day of every month and granted <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> which may be gained in any part of the world for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> before a copy of the picture. A <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> Roman copy for which <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> ordered a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> is annually celebrated among the "Prodigia" of 9 July.
