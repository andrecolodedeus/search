<h1>Shrines of Our Lady and the Saints in Great Britain and Ireland</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Sanctuaries of Our Lady</h2>
<h3 id="A">England</h3>

<p>(1) <a href="../cathen/01043c.htm">Abingdon</a> &#151; <a href="../cathen/05323a.htm">St. Edward the Martyr</a> and <a href="../cathen/05199a.htm">St. Dunstan</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, both encouraged <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> to <a href="../cathen/01043c.htm">Our Lady of Abingdon</a>, causing it to be resorted to by crowds of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p>(2) Canterbury &#151; At the east end of St. Augustine's <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was an oratory of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> built by King Ethelbert in which reposed the bodies of many <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. The old Chronicler informs us that "in it the Queen of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> did often appear; in it was the brightness of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> made manifest; in it the voices of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and the melodious strains of holy virgins were frequently heard".

<p>(3) Caversham, Berks &#151; A <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> in the church of the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Austin Canons</a> was a centre of great devotion, where rich offerings were made by Countess Isabel of Warwick, Elizabeth of York, queen-consort of Henry VII, and by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> in his youthful days. The entire image was plated with silver.

<p>(4) Coventry &#151; A celebrated image of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> was here greatly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>. With it are associated the glorious names of Leofric, Earl of Mercia, and his wife, the Countess Godgifu (Godiva). The splendid <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church founded by them in 1043 surpassed all others in the land in princely, even royal magnificence. It was spoken of as the glory of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and contained dazzling treasures. On her death Godgifu sent a rich chaplet of precious gems to be hung round <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady's</a> neck; no description of this image has reached us. The church was entirely demolished by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>.

<p>(5) Ely &#151; In the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> a magnificent image of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> seated on a throne with her Divine Child in her arms, the whole marvellously wrought in silver and gold. Hither came King Canute on the <a href="../cathen/03245b.htm">feast of Our Lady's Purification</a> (1020?).

<p>(6) <a href="../cathen/05648a.htm">Evesham</a> &#151; The name of this renowned sanctuary perpetuates the vision of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> to a poor herdsman named Eoves. An <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church was here built by Earl Leofric and the Countess Godgifu and enriched with a splendid image of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Child</a>, beautifully wrought of gold and silver. At once it became an object of popular devotion and attracted numerous <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>.

<p>(7) Glastonbury was the most ancient and venerable sanctuary of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (see Glastonbury Abbey). In 530 St. David of <a href="../cathen/10187d.htm">Menevia</a>, accompanied by seven of his suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, came to Glastonbury, invited thither by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of the place, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> a Chapel of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> on the east side of the church. As a mark of his devotion to the Queen of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, he adorned the golden superaltar with a sapphire of inestimable value, known as the Great Sapphire of Glastonbury. The Silver Chapel of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> was stored with costly gifts, the value of which, at our present standard, mounted to a prodigious sum. Among the Saxon kings who came hither on <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> may be mentioned Athelstan and Edgar the Peaceable, the latter laying his sceptre on the Blessed Virgin's altar and solemnly placing his kingdom under her patronage.

<p>(8) Ipswich &#151; There were four churches of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> in Ipswich, but the greatly renowned <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> image was in St. Mary's <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, known as Our Lady of Grace. The numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> wrought there were <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> genuine by <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">Blessed Thomas More</a> in one of his works. <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Cardinal Wolsey</a> ordered a yearly <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to be made to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady's</a> sanctuary by the students of the college he had founded at Ipswich. In the thirtieth year of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> this image was conveyed to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and burnt at Chelsea, the rich offerings and jewels going to the king's treasury.

<p>(9) Tewkesbury &#151; The church, founded in 715 by two Mercian dukes, Oddo and Doddo, enshrined within its walls a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> that was held in the greatest veneration. Isabella Beauchamp, Countess of Warwick, gave a <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and other valuable presents to this sanctuary in 1439. The <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> had the good fortune to escape destruction at the time of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, probably owing to the reluctance of the magistrates to arouse the indignation of the populace, who regarded it with extraordinary veneration. In the reign of James I a <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritan</a> inhabitant of the town got possession of this relic of the old religion, and to mark his contempt for it caused it to be hollowed out and used as a trough for swine. Terrible punishments overtook him and all the members of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>.

<p>(10) Walsingham was the most celebrated of all the English sanctuaries of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>. So great was the veneration in which it was held that it was called the "Holy Land of Walsingham". About 1061 a little <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, similar to that of the <a href="../cathen/13454b.htm">Holy House of Nazareth</a> (not yet translated to Loreto) and dedicated to the Annunciation, was built here by Rychold (Recholdis) de Faverches, a rich <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, in consequence, it is said, of an injunction received from <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>. Within the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was a wooden image of the Blessed Virgin and Child. Pilgrims flocked from all parts of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and from the Continent to this sanctuary, and its <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> became one of the richest in the world. Among the royal and noble <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> were: Henry III, who came in 1248; Edward I in 1272 (?) and 1296; Edward II in 1315; his consort, Isabella of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in 1332; <a href="../cathen/05321a.htm">Edward III</a> in 1361; Edward IV and his queen in 1469; Henry VII in 1487; <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> in 1511, walking barefoot from Barsham Hall, on which occasion he presented <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> with a necklace of great value; and finally Queen Catherine of Aragon in 1514. About 1538 the <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> image was brought to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> with that of Our Lady of Ipswich, and both were publicly burnt at Chelsea in presence of Cromwell. Fifteen of the canons of Walsingham were condemned for high treason; five were executed. All the jewels and treasures left by the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the faithful found their way into <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII's</a> coffers.



<p>(11) <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> &#151; St. Mary's Minster at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> is of ancient date, and pre-eminent amongst its benefactors were Leofric and Godgifu, Earl and Countess of Mercia. The celebrated image of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> and the Holy Child was carved of wood and of large size; it stood over the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> and could be seen from all parts of the church. The <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> Bishop Latimer, writing to Cromwell, refers to this statue in coarse terms, and expresses a hope that with its sisters of Walsingham and Ipswich it my be burnt in Smithfield.

<p>(12) Lincoln &#151; Our Lady of Lincoln is frequently mentioned among the sanctuaries which were regarded by the English with special veneration. In the inventory of the treasures of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> appropriated by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, there is mention of the image of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>, sitting in a chair, silver and gilt, having a crown on her head, silver and gilt, set with stones and pearls, and her Child sitting on her knee with one crown upon His head, with a diadem set with pearls and stones, having a ball with a cross, silver and gilt, in His left hand". Of <a href="../cathen/07519c.htm">St. Hugh of Lincoln</a> it is said that "for the glory of the ever Virgin Mother of the True Light, he <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> the lights which usually burned in her church with a host of others". Besides the above, there were many other remarkable sanctuaries of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> resorted before the unhappy days of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>.
<h3 id="B">Scotland</h3>

<p>(1) Aberdeen &#151; Our Lady at the Bridge of Dee, described as Our Lady at the Brig, is mentioned in 1459. Near to the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was a well dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, where <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> favours were obtained. In the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> were four <a href="../cathen/01355b.htm">altars of Our Lady</a>, each with her image, one being of silver.

<p>(2) Edinburgh: Our Lady of Holyrood &#151; In the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Church of the Sacred Heart, Lauriston Street there is an image of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Child</a>, carved in wood, which formerly was in Holyrood. For many years it was in the possession of the earls of Aberdeen and subsequently was purchased by Mr. Edmund Waterton, who presented it to the above church.

<p>(3) Haddington &#151; After defeating the Scots at Halidon Hill in 1333 <a href="../cathen/05321a.htm">Edward III</a> ravaged the Lowlands, and part of his navy (says the chronicler of 1355) "spoiled the Kirk of Our Lady of Haddington, and returned with the spoil thereof to their ships". But the sacrilege did not go unpunished, for a violent north wind rose and hurled the ships upon the sands and rocks.

<p>(4) Musselburgh &#151; The church, dedicated to Our Lady of Loreto, was most famous and resorted to by numerous <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> was rewarded with <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> favours. The fury of the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> reformers destroyed the sanctuary, and in 1590 the materials were used in building the Tolbooth.
<h3 id="C">Ireland</h3>

<p>(1) Dublin &#151; A <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the Virgin Mother was greatly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in St. Mary's Abbey and mention is made of it by Simmel in 1487. In 541 the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was destroyed, its <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> sequestrated, and the image partly burnt. Part of it, however, was saved and is now <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> church.

<p>(2) Muckross, formerly Irrelagh &#151; The image of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> was here greatly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>. When the English were devastating the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and had torn down and trampled on the crucifix, some of the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> carried off the image of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> and hid it at the foot of a dead tree. Soon the dead tree revived and leaves sprouted in abundance, forming a shelter to the concealed <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>.

<p>(3) Navan &#151; In the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church was an image of the Blessed Virgin held in great repute, to which people from all parts of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, princes and peasants, rich and poor, came on <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, and to which was attributed <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> power.

<p>(4) Trim, the most celebrated sanctuary of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, stood in the abbey of the canons regular of St. Augustine. Pilgrims flocked to it from all parts of the country and enriched it with their offerings. Many and great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are said to have been wrought here. The image of Our Lady of Trim shared the fate of Our Lady of Walsingham, being publicly burnt in 1539.
<h2 id="section2">Shrines of the saints</h2>

<p>(1) St. Thomas a Becket, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in Canterbury Cathedral in 1170. His sacred body, at first buried in the lower part of the church, was shortly after taken up and laid in a sumptuous shrine in the east end. Innumerable <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were wrought at his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> and <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> from all parts of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and the continent flocked thither to implore his aid. So great were the offerings made by them that the church abounded with more than princely riches. The shrine was covered with plates of gold and enriched with jewels, rubies, sapphires, diamonds, and great oriental pearls (Morris, "Life of St. Thomas", 391). It was an object of the unceasing veneration of all <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> until the well-known sacrilegious profanation under <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>.

<p>(2) <a href="../cathen/05322a.htm">St. Edward the Confessor</a>, d. 5 Jan., 1066. William the Conqueror, who ascended the throne in October of the same year, caused the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> coffin to be inclosed in a rich case of gold and silver. In 1102 the body was found to be incorrupt, the limbs flexible, and the cloths fresh and clean; several remarkable <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> took place at the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. Two years after <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> (1161) the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> body, still incorrupt, was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> translated to a shrine of surpassing magnificence, which was despoiled in the reign of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>.

<p>(3) <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, Apostle of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, d. 493 at Down in Ulster, where his body was found in a church of his name in 1185. It was then reverently translated to a shrine prepared in another part of the same church. On <a href="../cathen/12580a.htm">St. Patrick's Purgatory</a>, see <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">PILGRIMAGES</a>.

<p>(4) St. Wulstan, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, and one of the last of the Anglo-Saxon <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, d. in 1095, and was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1203. His venerable remains, clothed in pontifical vestments, were exposed in the church for three days to satisfy the devotion of the people, after which his friend, Robert, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a>, to whom he had appeared in a vision, came to celebrate his obsequies. His <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> in <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> was for centuries a centre of attraction to numerous <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> was rewarded with many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> favours. It was rifled of its treasures and despoiled by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> about the year 1539.

<p>(5) <a href="../cathen/06557b.htm">St. Gilbert of Sempringham</a> &#151; At the time of his death (4 Feb., 1189) many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> testified that they saw marvellous lights flashing from the sky, indicating that a great servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was quitting this world. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> at Sempringham and many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were reported to have occurred at his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>.

<p>(6) <a href="../cathen/08620a.htm">St. Kentigern of Scotland</a> (d. 600) spent the closing years of his life in <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>, where he was visited by St. Columba of <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a>. His <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of his titular church in Glasgow was long famous for <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, but is now despoiled of ornament and left without <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, except by the few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who chance to visit the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>.

<p>(7) St. Cuthbert of Lindisfarne (See <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">ST. CUTHBERT</a>).

<p>(8) <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban</a>, protomartyr of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, d. 304. In the time of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a> a magnificent church was erected on the place of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, where his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> became illustrious for <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> Saxons having destroyed this edifice, <a href="../cathen/11215c.htm">Offa, King of the Mercians</a>, erected another in 793 with a great <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, which became the head of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> communities in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.

<p>(9) St. Swithin (See <a href="../cathen/14357c.htm">ST. SWITHIN</a>).

In 1457 his remains were translated from Old Sarum to the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in modern Salisbury, and there deposited in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>.

<p>(11) St. Oswald, King of Northumbria, was slain by the King of Mercia in 642. His mutilated body found a resting place in Bardney Abbey, Lincolnshire, whence, during the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> invasion, it was removed to Gloucester Cathedral. See Oswald, Saint.

<p>(12) <a href="../cathen/01233d.htm">St. Aidan</a>, Bishop Of <a href="../cathen/09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a>, d. 651 within a tent set up for him by the wall of the church of the king's villa at Bamborough. It is related that <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a>, then a shepherd boy in the mountains, saw in vision his blessed spirit carried by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. He was first buried in the cemetery in <a href="../cathen/09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a>, but when the new Church of St. Peter was built there, his body was translated to it and deposited on the right hand of the altar. A portion of his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> was afterwards taken to <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a>.

<p>(13) <a href="../cathen/11084a.htm">St. Ninian</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06370a.htm">Galloway</a> &#151; His <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, where <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were wrought, was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> at <a href="../cathen/15614a.htm">Whithorn</a> till the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">change of religion</a>.

<p>(14) <a href="../cathen/14694c.htm">St. Thomas</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a>. &#151; The narrative of numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> obtained at his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> at <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a> filled whole volumes. A large <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> is preserved at <a href="../cathen/14309b.htm">Stonyhurst College</a>.

<p>(15) <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, d. 709 at Oundle in Northamptonshire.

<p>(16) <a href="../cathen/15656a.htm">St. Winefride</a>, virgin and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, d. 600. Her holy death took place at Gwytherin in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, hence her body was translated to Shrewsbury in 1138, and there deposited in the church of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey. At the dissolution of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> her shrine was plundered. Her <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> well at <a href="../cathen/07438a.htm">Holywell</a> is the only place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> in Great Britain that has survived the shock of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>.

<p>(17) <a href="../cathen/07515b.htm">St. Hugh</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lincoln, d. 1200, in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. His funeral was attended by John of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, William of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, who had dearly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, three <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, fourteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, above a hundred <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and a great number of earls and barons of the realm. Many and great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> took place at his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> in Lincoln Cathedral. Eighty years after his deposition the venerable body, found to be incorrupt, was translated to a richer shrine, which was plundered by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> some centuries later.

<p>(18) St. Edmund &#151; This holy king was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> by the Danes in 870. The saint's head, which had been struck off, was carried by the infidels into a wood and thrown into a brake of bushes, but <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> found by a pillar of light and deposited with the body at Haxon. The sacred treasure was conveyed to St. Edmundsbury, where the church of timber erected over it was replaced in 1020 by a stately edifice of stone. In 920, for fear of the Danes, the body was conveyed to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, but subsequently translated again to St. Edmundsbury. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church that enshrined his remains was one of the richest and stateliest in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.
