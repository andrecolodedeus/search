<h1>Shrovetide</h1>  

<p><em>Shrovetide</em> is the English equivalent of what is known in the greater part of Southern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> as the "Carnival", a word which, in spite of wild suggestions to the contrary, is undoubtedly to be derived from the "taking away of flesh" (<em>carne levare</em>) which marked the beginning of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>. The English term "shrovetide" (from "to shrive", or hear <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a>) is sufficiently explained by a sentence in the Anglo-Saxon "Ecclesiastical Institutes" translated from Theodulphus by <a href="../cathen/01171b.htm">Abbot Aelfric</a> about A.D. 1000: "In the week immediately before <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> everyone shall go to his confessor and confess his deeds and the confessor shall so shrive him as he then may hear by his deeds what he is to do [in the way of penance]". In this name shrovetide the religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is uppermost, and the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the German <em>Fastnacht</em> (the eve of the fast). It is intelligible enough that before a long period of deprivations <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> should allow itself some exceptional licence in the way of frolic and good cheer. No appeal to vague and often inconsistent traces of earlier <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> customs seems needed to explain the general observance of a carnival celebration. The only clear fact which does not seem to be adequately accounted for is the widespread tendency to include the preceding Thursday (called in French <em>Jeudi gras</em> and in German <em>fetter Donnerstag</em> &#151; just as Shrove Tuesday is respectively called <em>Mardi gras</em> and <em>fetter Dienstag</em>) with the Monday and Tuesday which follow <a href="../cathen/12614a.htm">Quinquagesima</a>. The English custom of eating pancakes was undoubtedly suggested by the need of using up the eggs and fat which were, originally at least, prohibited articles of diet during the forty days of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>. The same prohibition is, of course, mainly responsible for the association of eggs with the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter festival</a> at the other end of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>. Although the observance of Shrovetide in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> never ran to the wild excesses which often marked this period of licence in southern climes, still various sports and especially games of football were common in almost all parts of the country, and in the households of the great it was customary to celebrate the evening of Shrove Tuesday by the performance of plays and masques. One form of cruel sport peculiarly prevalent at this season was the throwing at cocks, neither does it seem to have been confined to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The festive observance of Shrovetide had become far too much a part of the life of the people to be summarily discarded at the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. In Dekker's "Seven Deadly Sins of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>", 1606, we read: "they presently, like prentices upon Shrove-Tuesday, take the game into their own hands and do what they list"; and we learn from contemporary writers that the day was almost everywhere kept as a holiday, while many kinds of horseplay seem to have been tolerated or winked at in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> and public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> repeatedly made efforts to check the excesses of the carnival, especially in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. During the sixteenth century in particular a special form of the Forty Hours <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> was instituted in many places on the Monday and Tuesday of Shrovetide, partly to draw the people away from these dangerous <a href="../cathen/11196a.htm">occasions of sin</a>, partly to make expiation for the excesses committed. By a special constitution addressed by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, and headed "Super Bacchanalibus", a plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> was granted in 1747 to those who took part in the Exposition of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> which was to be carried out daily for three days during the carnival season.
