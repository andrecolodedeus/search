<h1>Sichem</h1>  

<p>(A.V. <em>Shechem</em>).

<p>An <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelite</a> city in the tribe of Ephraim, the first capital of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Kingdom of Israel</a>. Its position is clearly indicated in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>: it lay north of Bethal and Silo, on the high road going from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to the northern districts (Judges xxi, 19), at a short distance from Machmethath (<a href="../bible/jos017.htm#vrs7">Joshua 17:7</a>) and of Dothain (<a href="../bible/gen037.htm#vrs12">Genesis 37:12-17</a>); it was in the hill-country of Ephraim (<a href="../bible/jos020.htm#vrs7">Joshua 20:7</a>; <a href="../bible/jos021.htm#vrs21">21:21</a>; <a href="../bible/1ki012.htm#vrs25">1 Kings 12:25</a>; <a href="../bible/1ch006.htm#vrs67">1 Chronicles 6:67</a>; <a href="../bible/1ch007.htm#vrs28">7:28</a>), immediately below Mount Garizim (<a href="../bible/jdg009.htm#vrs6">Judges 9:6-7</a>). These indications are completed by <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, who says that the city lay between Mt. Ebal and Mt. Garizim, and by the Medaba map, which places <em>Sychem</em>, also called <em>Sikima</em> between the Tour Gobel (Ebal) and the Tour Garizin (Garizim). We may therefore admit unhesitatingly that Sichem stood on (St. Jerome, <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>), or very close to (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, "Onomast.", <em>Euchem</em>; Medaba map), the site occupied by the town of Nablus, the Neapolis, or Flavia Neapolis of early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ages.

<p>That the city of Sichem, the name of which (<a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>sh&eacute;k&eacute;m</em> &mdash; shoulder, saddle) appears to have been suggested by the configuration of the place, existed in the time of Abraham is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> by a few who think it is referred to in <a href="../bible/gen012.htm#vrs6">Genesis 12:6</a>, by anticipation; but there can be no question touching its existence in Jacob's time (<a href="../bible/gen033.htm#vrs18">Genesis 33:18, 19</a>); it is certainly mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/14477d.htm">El-Amarna letters</a> (letter 289), and is probably the Sakama of the old <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> traveler Mohar (fourteenth century B.C.; Muller, "Asien u. Europ.", p. 394, Leipzig, 1893). Owing to its central position, no less than to the presence in the neighborhood of places hallowed by the memory of Abraham (<a href="../bible/gen012.htm#vrs6">Genesis 12:6, 7</a>; <a href="../bible/gen034.htm#vrs5">34:5</a>), Jacob (<a href="../bible/gen033.htm#vrs18">Genesis 33:18-19</a>; <a href="../bible/gen034.htm#vrs2">34:2</a>, etc.), and Joseph (<a href="../bible/jos024.htm#vrs32">Joshua 24:32</a>), the city was destined to play an important part in the history of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. There it was that, after Gedeon's death, Abimelech, his son by a Sichemite <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a>, was made king (<a href="../bible/jdg009.htm#vrs1">Judges 9:1-6</a>) but the city having, three years later, risen in rebellion, Abimelech took it, utterly destroyed it, and burnt the temple of Baal-berith where the people had fled for safety. When and by whom the city was rebuilt is not known; at any rate, Sichem was the place appointed, after Solomon's death, for the meeting of the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and the investiture of Roboam; the meeting ended in the secession of the ten northern tribes, and Sichem, fortified by Jeroboam, became for a while the capital of the new kingdom (<a href="../bible/1ki012.htm#vrs1">1 Kings 12:1</a>; <a href="../bible/1ki014.htm#vrs17">14:17</a>; <a href="../bible/2ch010.htm#vrs1">2 Chronicles 10:1</a>). When the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> moved first to Thersa, and later on to <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, Sichem lost its importance, and we do not hear of it until after the fall of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (587 B.C.; <a href="../bible/jer012.htm#vrs5">Jeremiah 12:5</a>). The events connected with the restoration were to bring it again into prominence. When, on his second visit to Jerusalem, Nehemias expelled the grandson of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> Eliashib (probably the Manasse of <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, "Antiq., XI, vii, viii), who refused to separate from his alien wife, Sanaballat's daughter, and with him the many <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, who sided with the rebel, these betook themselves to Sichem; a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> temple was then erected on Mount Garizim and thus Sichem became the "holy city" of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>. The latter, who were left unmolested while the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were chafing under the heavy hand of Antiochus IV (Antiq., XII, v, 5) and welcomed with open arms every renegade who came to them from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (Antiq., XI, viii, 7), fell about 128 B.C. before John Hyrcanus, and their temple was destroyed ("Antiq.", XIII, ix, 1).

<p>From that time on, Sichem shared in the fate of the other cities of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>: with these it was annexed, at the time of the deposition of Archelaus, in A.D. 6, to the Roman Province of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. Some, no doubt, of its inhabitants (whether Sichar of <a href="../bible/joh004.htm#vrs5">John 4:5</a>, is the same as Sichem or a place near the latter we shall leave here undecided) were of the number of the "Samaritans" who believed in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> when He tarried two days in the neighborhood (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm">John 4</a>), and the city must have been visited by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> on their way from <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> to Jerusalem (<a href="../bible/act008.htm#vrs25">Acts 8:25</a>). Of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> of Sichem not a few rose up in arms on Mt. Garizim at the time of the Galilean rebellion (A.D. 67); the city was very likely destroyed on that occasion by Cerealis ("Bell. Jud.", III, vii, 32), and a few years after a new city, Flavia Neapolis, was built by <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> a short distance to the west of the old one; some fifty years later Hadrian restored the temple on Mt. Garizim, and dedicated it to Jupiter (Dion Cass., xv, 12). Neapolis, like Sichem, had very early a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community and had the honor to give to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> her first <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a>, <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin Martyr</a>; we hear even of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Neapolis (Labbe, "Conc.", I, 1475, 1488; II, 325). On several occasions the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> suffered greatly from the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>, and in 474 the emperor, to avenge an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> attack of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, deprived the latter of Mt. Garizim and gave it to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who built on it a church dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> (Procop., "De edif", v, 7). Since the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> conquest (636) <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, except during the twelfth century, has practically disappeared from Nabl&uacute;s, which, however, remains the headquarters of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> (about 150 members) and of their <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>.
