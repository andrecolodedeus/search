<h1>Sidon</h1>  

<p>The seat of a <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> and a <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> see in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. Sidon is the oldest city of the <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicians</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of the great colonial empire established by this people (Strabo, XVI, i, 22). It is mentioned in the ethnological table of Genesis (x, 19); the territory of the tribe of <a href="../cathen/15739b.htm">Zabulon</a> reached even to the gates of this city (<a href="../bible/gen049.htm#vrs13">Genesis 49:13</a>), but the Hebrews never were its masters (<a href="../bible/jos011.htm#vrs8">Joshua 11:8</a>; <a href="../bible/jos013.htm#vrs3">13:3, 6</a>; <a href="../bible/jos019.htm#vrs28">19:28</a>; <a href="../bible/jdg001.htm#vrs31">Judges 1:31</a>; <a href="../bible/jdg003.htm#vrs3">3:3</a>; <a href="../bible/jdg010.htm#vrs12">10:12</a>; <a href="../bible/jdg018.htm#vrs7">18:7</a>). The supremacy of the Sidonians continued until about 1252 B.C., when the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, after partly destroying Sidon, built on the old foundations the city of Dor, above Jaffa. The Sidonians fled to <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, one of their colonies, which then became the leading city. Sidon, called the mother of the <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenician</a> cities, for <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, Hippo were settled by emigrants from there, was noted for its bronze, its commerce, navigation, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of mathematics and <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>; it is mentioned with great praise by Homer (Iliad, XXIII, 743; Odyssey, XV, 425; XIII, 285). After its downfall it is often mentioned in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, but nearly always in terms of censure and as a subject of reproach (<a href="../bible/joe003.htm#vrs4">Joel 3:4, 5</a>; <a href="../bible/jer025.htm#vrs22">Jeremiah 25:22</a>; <a href="../bible/eze032.htm#vrs30">Ezekiel 32:30</a>). <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Queen Jezabel</a>, wife of Achab, was the daughter of a king of <a href="../cathen/13777a.htm">Sidon</a> (<a href="../bible/1ki016.htm#vrs31">1 Kings 16:31</a>), for the city for a long time had its own rulers, although we find the inhabitants rendering service to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> for the building of the temple (<a href="../bible/1ch022.htm#vrs4">1 Chronicles 22:4</a>). Sidon was taken several times by the Assyrian kings, to whom its rulers paid tribute; finally in 676, when its name was changed to Ir-Asaraddon, and its inhabitants were killed, or carried captive into <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a>. When Babylon succeeded Nineveh in the sovereignty of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> (606 B.C.), Sidon allied itself with <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> to throw off this yoke and that of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (<a href="../bible/eze027.htm#vrs8">Ezekiel 27:8</a>); the conqueror, <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a>, turned his wrath on <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, and Sidon took advantage of this to recover some of its former glory. It was a willing subject of the Medes and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> from 538 to 351 B.C., but, having revolted in the latter year against Artaxerxes Ochus, it was burned by its inhabitants, 40,000 of whom perished in the flames (Diod. Sic., XVI, xli-xlvi). Finally it passed under the rule of the Greeks, sometimes of the <a href="../cathen/13690a.htm">Seleucides</a>, sometimes of the Lagides, thus becoming gradually hellenized; at this time it had a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Under the Romans Sidon assumed the name of Nauarchis, later that of <a href="../cathen/04125b.htm">Colonia</a> Augusta, or Metropolis, and had its own <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a>. This period begins about 110 B.C.

<p><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> visited the countries of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and Sidon (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm#vrs21">Matthew 15:21</a>; <a href="../bible/mar007.htm#vrs31">Mark 7:31</a>), passing through Sidon after healing the Syro-Phoenician <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, returning to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> from Caesarea, stopped with his friends at <a href="../cathen/13777a.htm">Sidon</a>, where there were some <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm#christian">Christian families</a> (<a href="../bible/act027.htm#vrs3">Acts 27:3</a>). At an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> Sidon became a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, subject to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and included in the Patriarchate of Antioch. Theodore (present at the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a>, 325) is the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of whom there is any record; the two most celebrated are Paul ar-R&acirc;heb, an Arabic writer of the thirteenth century, and Euthymius, founder of the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian Order</a> of St. Saviour, and one of the first organizers of the <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, about the latter part of the seventeenth century. For others see <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a>, "Oriens christ.", II, 811-14. Mention is also made of two native <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>: the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Zenobius, in the reign of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250108.htm"><em>Church History</em> VIII.13</a>) and Serapion (feast 21 March), a legendary personage. A great synod on the subject of <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a> was held at <a href="../cathen/13777a.htm">Sidon</a> in 512. The city was unsuccessfully attacked by the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> king, Baldwin I, in 1108, and was captured by the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a> in 1111 after a long siege by land and water. From that time it was a dependency of the <a href="../cathen/08361a.htm">Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem</a>. In 1187 Sidon surrendered to Saladin, who destroyed the ramparts, but it was retaken by the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> in 1197, and held by them, notwithstanding temporary occupations by the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> and Mongols, until 1291, when Sultan El-Ashraft threw down the walls. In 1253 Saint Louis resided there for several months, and the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> held possession the greater part of the time. During the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> occupancy it was called in Latin Sagitta, and in French Sagette, from its native name, Saida. The Latin <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, was administered by the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and not by that of Antioch, as formerly; it was already in existence in 1131, having probably been founded some years previously. Dating from 1291 it was only a titular <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, see <a href="../cathen/05181b.htm">Du Cange</a>, Les Familles d'Outre-Mer", 805; <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a>, "Oriens christ.", III, 1319-24; Eubel, "Hierarchia catholica medii aevi", I, 473;.II, 260, III, 318.

<p>After the departure of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, Sidon was a city of little importance, acting as a port for Damascus; under the Druse Ameer Fakhr-ed-D&iacute;n (1595-1634) many <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a>, especially French, being attracted thereto, it became very prosperous. Its downfall began, however, when Djezzar Pasha expelled (1791) all <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> from the pashalic, and settled at Saint Jean d'Acre; its ruin was completed by the commercial development of <a href="../cathen/02392a.htm">Beirut</a>. In 1837 it suffered from an earthquake, and in 1840 from a bombardment by <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> fleets; in 1860 nearly 1800 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were massacred in its district. In the <a href="../cathen/03504a.htm">necropolis</a> were found the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> sarcophagi, said to be of Alexander and the Weepers, now at the museum of Constantinople, and considered the most beautiful in the world. Saida numbers 12,000 inhabitants, of whom 1200 are <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 1000 <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a>, 250 Latins, 200 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and 800 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; the remainder are <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a>. The city, located in the midst of gardens and thus retaining its surname of "Flowery", forms a caza of the vilayet of <a href="../cathen/02392a.htm">Beirut</a>. Although the harbor is partly blocked by sand, its commerce is of importance. The <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> diocese numbers 40,000 <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, 200 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 100 churches. The <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> diocese numbers 18,550 <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, 42 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 50 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 36 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> order of St-Saviour have their mother-house at Deir-el-Moukhalles; they possess 4 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and number 28 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 65 scholastics and <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, and 9 1ay brothers. The <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> Sisters number 30, in one <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> have made considerable headway in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which the native <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> have not as yet been able to counteract. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, established there in 1827, conduct the Latin <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys; the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> have had a house there since 1855; the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> direct the dispensary and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls.
