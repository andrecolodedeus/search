<h1>Sidon</h1>  

<p>Titular <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of Pamphylia Prima. Sidon, situated on the coast of Pamphylia, was a colony of Cumae in &AElig;olia. Dating from the tenth century B.C., its <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a> bore the head of Athena (Minerva), the patroness of the city, with a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Pamphylian legend. Its people, a piratical horde, quickly forgot their own language to adopt that of the aborigines. For rendering tribute to Alexander they were accorded a <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonian</a> garrison. A commercial and warlike city, with a powerful navy, it was in continual rivalry with Aspendus. In its waters the fleet of Antiochus the Great, commanded by Hannibal with Sidonian vessels upon the right wing, was beaten by the Rhodians. From that time Sidon was a rendezvous of pirates, above all, a <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> slave market. After the destruction of piracy elsewhere Sidon continued to derive considerable wealth and profit from both these sources. It was the capital of Pamphylia, later of Pamphylia Prima. In the tenth century Constantine Porphyrogenitus called it still a nest of pirates. Its downfall was complete in the fourteenth century, its people having abandoned it by degrees, owing to the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> invasions, and lack of water. At present the deserted ruins are called Eski Adalia, Old Attalia, in the sanjak of Adalia and the vilayet of Koniah. They consist of a temple, basilica, gymnasium, aqueduct, public bath, theatre, ramparts, etc. and some inscriptions. Sidon is mentioned in <a href="../bible/1ma015.htm#vrs23">1 Maccabees 15:23</a>, among the cities and countries to which the Roman letter proclaiming their alliance with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> was sent. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was early introduced into Sidon. St. Nestor, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> in 251, was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Pergi, not of Sidon as <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> (Oriens Christ., I, 995) believed The first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Epidaurus, presiding at the Council of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a>, 314. Others are John, fourth century; Eustathius, 381; Amphilochius, 426-458, who played an important part in the history of the time; Conon, 536; Peter, 553; John, 680-692; Mark, 879; Theodore, 1027-1028; Anthimus, present at the Council of Constantinople where <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Michael Cerularius</a> completed the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1054; John, then counsellor to the Emperor Michael VII Ducas, presided at a council on the worship of images, 1082; Theodosius and his successor Nicetas, twelfth century. John, present at a Council of Constantinople 1156. The <a href="../cathen/11124b.htm">"Notitiae Episcopatuum"</a> continued to mention Sidon as a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of Pamphylia until the thirteenth century. It does not appear in the "Notitia" of Andronicus III. From other documents we learn that in 1315 and for some time previous to that, Sidon had <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of its own &mdash; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14014b.htm">Sinope</a> was called to the position, but was unable to leave his own diocese; this call was repeated in 1338 and 1345. In 1397 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was united with that of <a href="../cathen/02060b.htm">Attalia</a>; in 1400 the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/11667a.htm">Perge</a> and Attalia was at the same time the administrator of Sidon. Since then, the city has disappeared from history.

<p>Sidon was the home of Eustachius of Antioch (see <a href="../cathen/05627b.htm">EUSTATHIUS</a>), of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Troilus, the master of <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, himself a teacher; of the celebrated fifth-century <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer Philip; of the famous lawyer Tribonianus (sixth century).
