<h1>Siena</h1>  

<p>(SENENSIS)

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> (Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>). The city is situated on three gently swelling hills. The Public Library was donated by Archdeacon Bandini (1663). The Academy of Fine Arts, the Museum of the Cathedral, and the different churches of the city, illustrate almost completely the history of art in Siena; in no other city had art, especially <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, a more local character, and nowhere else did it remain so conservative. <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic architecture</a> produced here its most excellent monuments, both <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and in civic buildings; and the Sienese architects laboured beyond the confines of their state (e.g. the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>). Sculpture received its first impulse from Nicolo and Giovanni Pisani, whose Sienese disciples carved the decorations of the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The most renowned <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptors</a> of the fifteenth century were Jacopo della Quercia (1374-1438), one of the pioneers of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>; Lorenzo di Pietro; Antonio Federighi; Francesco di Giorgio (also an architect); Giacomo Cozzarelli; and Lorenzo Mariano. Sculpture in wood is represented by the brothers Antonio and Giovanni Barili, Bartolomeo Neroni, and others. In <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> Siena possessed in <a href="../cathen/05181c.htm">Duccio</a> an artist who greatly surpassed his contemporary <a href="../cathen/03771a.htm">Cimabue</a> of Florence, both for grace and in accuracy of design. Nevertheless, art developed and was perfected in Florence more rapidly than in Siena. <a href="../cathen/09730d.htm">Simone Martini</a> (1285-1344), immortalized by <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarca</a>, and a citizen of Siena, bears comparison with <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a>. Lippo Memmi (also a miniaturist), <a href="../cathen/09357c.htm">Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti</a>, imitated with facility the grandiose composition of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a>. But Bertolo di Fredi (1330-1410); Taddeo de Bartolo (1360-1422); and the fifteenth century <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>, Domenico di Bartolo, Sano di Pietro, <a href="../cathen/15317c.htm">Vecchietta</a>, Matteo, and Benvenuto di Giovanni, compared with the Florentines, seem almost <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a>. Siena therefore turned anew to Florentine, Lombard, or <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>, under whom the ancient fame of the city revived, especially in the works of Bernardino Fungai, Girolamo della Pacchia, and others. The most renowned representatives of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> in Siena are <a href="../cathen/11738a.htm">Baldassare Peruzzi</a>, better known as the architect of the Basilica of San Pietro, <a href="../cathen/14129a.htm">Giovanni Antonio Bazzi</a>, and Il Sodoma (1477-1549), a rival of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>. With Domenico Beccafumi (1486-1551) begins the decadence. In the nineteenth century Paolo Franchi founded a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> closely related to the "Nazarenes" (a group of German <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> of the early nineteenth century, who imitated the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> of the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries); the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Istituto di Santa Teresa gives a good <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of their art.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Siena is said to occupy the site of a <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of Minerva. The present building was begun in the early thirteenth century; the <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> was finished in 1464. But in 1339 it was decided to so enlarge the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> that the area then occupied by the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> should form the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a> of the new building. In fact the construction of the longitudinal <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, now in part incorporated in the Opera del Duomo, was actually commenced. Though the pestilence of 1348 compelled the citizens to desist from this plan, they determined to complete in a worthy manner the original design. As it stands the building is about 292 ft. long and 80 ft. wide &mdash; 168 ft. in the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> is decorated with bands of red, white, and black marble, tricuspidal, and richly adorned with <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> (restored in 1869) and with <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> (renewed in 1878). In the interior the pavement is of admirable marble <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> &mdash; the work of masters of the fifteenth century, which has been for the most part renewed. The <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a>, entirely in relief, is the work of <a href="../cathen/11047b.htm">Nicolo Pisano</a> and his pupils; the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> is by Petruzzi, the bronze tabernacle by <a href="../cathen/15317c.htm">Vecchietta</a>, and the carvings of the choir by the brothers Barili. The <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of San Giovanni contains a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> by <a href="../cathen/05115d.htm">Donatello</a>, besides <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> by other <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptors</a>, and frescoes by <a href="../cathen/12103b.htm">Pinturicchio</a>. Scattered through the interior of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> are <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of Sienese <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Siena. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> possesses ancient choir-books and other <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, and is adorned throughout with frescoes by <a href="../cathen/12103b.htm">Pinturicchio</a> representing scenes from the life of <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> &mdash; the gift of <a href="../cathen/12128a.htm">Pius III</a>. In the centre of the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> is the celebrated group of the Three Graces, presented by <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>. In the Opera dei Duomo are preserved the remains of the exterior <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> and of the pavement of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, as well as <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> and sacred tapestries. In the Hospital of Sta Maria della Scala (thirteenth century) the church and the pellegrinaro (a large sick room) with frescoes by Domenico di Bartolo are noteworthy; San Agostino possesses pictures and frescoes by <a href="../cathen/11737b.htm">Perugino</a>, <a href="../cathen/14129a.htm">Sodoma</a>, Matteo di Giovanni, and others. Beneath the choir of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is the ancient <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a>, now the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> Church of San Giovanni, with its remarkable font, ornamented with <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> by <a href="../cathen/12601a.htm">Quercia</a>, <a href="../cathen/05115d.htm">Donatello</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06544a.htm">Ghiberti</a>. In Santa Maria del Carmine the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> and the Chapel of the Sacrament are particularly interesting. The Oratory of San Bernardino contains works of the principal Sienese artists, especially of <a href="../cathen/14129a.htm">Sodoma</a> and Beccafumi. The house of <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a> (Benineasa) has been transformed into a number of <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, which centuries have vied in adorning. San Domenico (1293) possesses pictures by <a href="../cathen/14129a.htm">Sodoma</a>, Fungai, Vanni, and others, and a tabernacle by <a href="../cathen/09556a.htm">Benedetto da Maiano</a>. The little church of Fonteguista has frescoes by Fungai, Petruzzi, and Lorenzo di Mariano. Scattered throughout the other churches are works of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Outside of the city is the Convento dell' Osservanza, with majolicas by <a href="../cathen/13095a.htm">Andrea della Robbia</a> and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="../cathen/14129a.htm">Sodoma</a>, Sano di Pietro, Taddeo Bartolo, and others; here also are shown the cell of St Bernardino of Siena, and the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Pandolfo Petrucci. More distant from Siena are the Certosa di Pontignano, the Abbey of Sant' Eugenio (730), and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Galgano (1201).



<p>Of the civic buildings we mention the Palazzo Pubblico (1289), with the Torre del Mangia (102 metres), at the foot of which in the form of a graceful loggia is the Capella di Piazza (1376-1460), adorned with frescoes and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a>. In the interior of the Palazzo Pubblico, the halls of the ground and first stories (Sala della Pace, del Mappamondo, di Balia) are decorated with frescoes by <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> named above and by others; the frescoes of the Sala Vittorio Emanuele are modern (Maccari and others). In front of the Palazzo Pubblico extends the great <a href="../cathen/12072c.htm">Piazza</a> del Campo, where on the second of July and the fifteenth of August of each year are held the celebrated races &mdash; Corse del Palio &mdash; which by reason of the gay medley of the riders and their historic costumes attract a great number of strangers each year. (Heywood, "Our Lady of August and the Palio", Siena, 1889). The Fonte Gaia (Joyful Fountain) in the public square is the work of <a href="../cathen/12601a.htm">Jacopo della Quercia</a>. Among the private palaces the following are of note: Spannochi, Casino de' Nobili, Tolomei, Buonsignori, Piccolomini (the last named contains the public archives). The Monte dei Paschi is perhaps the oldest of all non-charitable houses of credit. It was founded in 1500, and was reorganized in 1654, when the pastures (<em>paschi</em>) of the Maremma, from which it derives its name, were assigned it in guise of securities.

<p>In ancient times Saena, an Etruscan city, was of no great importance, hence remains of the Etruscan and Roman epochs are rare. It became a Roman colony under <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>. Under the Lombards it was the seat of two <em>gastaldi</em> (magistrates), one a judge, the other a minister of finance. Under the Carlovingians it was made a country, which in 868 became hereditary in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Vinigiso Ranieri, which soon in its various branches divided the territory. The power of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> increased in consequence, so that in the eleventh and twelfth centuries he was the sole ruler of the city and the surrounding territory, though he recognized the over-lordship of the margraves of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. At the death of Matilda (the last Countess of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, 1115) a municipal government already existed, and in 1125 consuls are first mentioned. Thenceforth the form of government changed continuously. In the beginning there were three consuls, later there were twelve, the office being restricted to members of noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. At other times a dictator was named. Through donations, purchases, and conquests, particularly from various petty lords of the Maremma ever plotting against Siena, the territory of the republic increased. In its expansion Siena naturally conflicted with Florence. Thus in the struggle for Poggibonzi (1141) the Sienese won, but were conquered by the Florentines in 1445. The rivalry with Florence consequently determined the politics of Siena, which adhered to the imperial (Ghibelline) party. Nevertheless in 1194 the Sienese repulsed the army of Henry VI, who failed to recognize the privileges accorded the city by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. This victory increased the prestige of the republic, which now enlarged the circuit of its walls. In 1197 it joined the League of San Genesio. In 1199 the common people, wishing to participate in the government, secured the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of a <em>podest&agrave;</em> (chief magistrate) for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, although the administration remained in the hands of the consuls of the guilds. A new change occurred in 1212, in which the administration passed to the <em>Provveditori</em> (purveyors) <em>della Biccherna</em>, while the consuls were reduced in rank to simple councillors. In consequence the heads of government changed in rapid succession: the Twenty-seven, Twenty-four, Seventy, Thirty-seven. Meanwhile at the battle of Montaperto (1260) Siena, at the head of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibellines</a> of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, had humiliated the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> Florence. But in Siena itself the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a>, aided by Charles of Anjou, acquired the sovereignty in 1277.

<p>The offices were all bestowed upon <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a>, who for the most part were required to be merchants. Meanwhile the petty <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a> lords of the Maremma laid waste the territory of the republic, despite the mediation of <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Pope Nicholas III</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a> Government of the "Fifteen", instituted in 1282, lasted for seventy years. During this period occurred the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01702b.htm">Arezzo</a>, head of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibellines</a>, who was conquered at Pieve al Toppo. Internal discords among the principal <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, the recurrence in Siena of the conflicts between the <em>Bianchi</em> (whites) and <em>Neri</em> (blacks), for which the city was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, the seditions of the butchers, <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, and notaries, fomented by the nobles excluded from the government, failed to displace the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a> merchants. It required the Great Pestilence of 1348, with its 30,000 victims in the city, and the advent of Emperor Charles IV to effect a change in the government. In 1355 the nobles and the common people rose in revolt, and instituted a mixed government of twelve plebeians and twelve nobles with four hundred councillors. But this lasted only a short time; in 1368 three changes were effected, and the whole year of 1369 was saddened by revolts and slaughter. The arbitration of Florence was of little avail. To these tumults and constitutional conspiracies within the city was added (1387) the rebellion of <a href="../cathen/10531a.htm">Montepulciano</a>, fomented by Florence. A <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with Florence arose in consequence, in which the Sienese had as an ally Gian Galeazzo Visconti, proclaimed in 1399 lord of Siena. But in 1404 they deserted Visconti, made peace with Florence, to whom <a href="../cathen/10531a.htm">Montepulciano</a> was abandoned, and constituted a new government. From 1407-13 Siena was repeatedly assaulted by King Ladislaus of Naples, on account of its adhesion to the "Conciliabulum" of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>. In 1480, on the accession of new tumults over the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to participate in the government, Pandolfo Petrucci acquired the upper hand, and in 1487 instituted a new and absolute government. Caesar Borgia secured the expulsion of Petrucci from Siena; but in 1503 the latter returned, assumed the title of Magnifico (Maecenas of the Arts), and was more powerful than ever. His son Borghese Petrucci, who succeeded him in the <em>signoria</em>, was in 1516 expelled by order of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, who intended to subject Siena to the <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici</a>, hence the enmity that Cardinal Alfonso Petrucci bore him. <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> was on the point of proclaiming the <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici</a> as rulers when the victory of Pavia (1525) and succeeding events destroyed his hopes. The Spanish protectorate <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> even more severe. <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> wished to compel the Sienese (1550) to construct a fortress for the Spanish garrison, whereupon they sought the aid of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, which sent a garrison of its own, so that the Spanish and Florentine troops abandoned the city. But Cosimo de' Medici was unwilling to relinquish his prey. Indignant because the command of the garrison had been given to Pietro Strozzi, a Florentine rebel, he invaded the territory of the Republic in 1554, and after several successful encounters, laid siege to the city, which surrendered, 17 April, 1555. Montacino, Chiusi, and <a href="../cathen/07039a.htm">Grosseto</a> maintained themselves for a few years longer, but in 1559, under the terms of the Peace of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, the French troops departed. Thus the <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici</a> acquired finally the large territory now divided between the Provinces of Siena and <a href="../cathen/07039a.htm">Grosseto</a>. Orbetello alone was given to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The Sienese soon accommodated themselves to the new regime, which left them much autonomy.

<p>Among the renowned natives of Siena were <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>, <a href="../cathen/12128a.htm">Pius III</a>, <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>; the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> St. Galgano (1181) and St. Giacomo (eleventh century); St. Catarina Benincasa, St. Bernardino Albizzeschi, and St. Ambrogio Sansedoni. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinus</a> and Ochino were born at Siena. As first apostle of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a>, Siena venerates St. Ansanus who suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>. Bishop "Florianus a Sinna", present at the Council of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (313) is claimed by Siena as its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, also by other cities of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of certain date was Eusebius (465). The Lombard invasion interrupted the episcopal succession in Siena; it was restored in 635 with Bishop Maurus, when Rotharis rebuilt the city. In 713 commenced the controversy concerning <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over certain lands between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Siena and Arezzo, which lasted for three centuries (712-1029). The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Siena (Adeodatus in 713, Ausifredus (752), Cantius (853), Lupis (881), Leo (1029) claimed <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority over all territory within political limits of the republic. The struggle was decided in favour of <a href="../cathen/01702b.htm">Arezzo</a>.

In 1384 the canons exercised for the last time their right to elect the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the election not being confirmed. In 1407 <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> residing at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> named as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> his nephew Gabriele Condulmer, afterwards <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>. <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>, a former <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Siena (1449), made the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> in 1459. The first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was Cardinal Francesco Nanni Todeschini Piccolomini (afterwards <a href="../cathen/12128a.htm">Pius III</a>), succeeded in 1503 by his nephew Cardinal Giovanni Todeschini.

Alessandro Petrucci (1615), emulating <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>, was active in reforming the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Leonardo Marsili (1684) was much opposed by the <em>comune</em> and by the Grand Duke of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. Cardinal Felice Zondadari (1795-1823) suffered exile in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1809; Enrico Bindi (1871) was a man of letters.

<h2>Council of Siena (1423)</h2>

<p>It was decreed in the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> that five years later another council should be called. In fact <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> summoned it for Pavia, where it was inaugurated on 23 April, 1423. The general session had not yet begun when the pestilence broke out at <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, for which reason the transfer of the Council to Siena was decreed. The procedure of the Council was almost identical with that at <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a>. Certain formalities of safe conduct issued by the city for the members of the Council were the cause of friction with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. On the eighth of November four decrees were published: against the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclifites</a>; against those who continued the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>; on the postponement of the negotiation with the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Greek schismatics</a>, and on greater vigilance against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Gallican proposals of reform were productive of discord with the French. On 19 February, 1424, Basle was selected as the place of the next Council. On 20 February the dissolution of the Council was decreed, but the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> was not published until 7 March. The French would have preferred to continue the Council until the "reform" of the church <em>"in capite et in membris"</em> (in its head and its members) had been accomplished, but whether to avoid a new <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, or on account of fear of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (since Siena was too near the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>), they departed. The magistrates of Siena took care not to let anyone depart until he had paid his <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a>.
