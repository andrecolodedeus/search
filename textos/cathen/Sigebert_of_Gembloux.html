<h1>Sigebert of Gembloux</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> historian, b. near <a href="../cathen/06407c.htm">Gembloux</a> which is now in the Province of <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, about 1035; d. at the same place, 5 November, 1112. He was apparently not a German, but seems to have been of Latin descent. He received his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at the Abbey of Gembloux and at an early age became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in this <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>; after this he taught for a long time at the Abbey of St. Vincent at <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>. About 1070 he returned to <a href="../cathen/06407c.htm">Gembloux</a>, where he was universally admired and <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>, and had charge there of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> until his death. While at <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> he wrote the biographies of Bishop Theodoric I of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> (964-85), of King Sigebert III, founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Martin at <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, and also a long poem on the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of St. Lucia, whose <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> at the Abbey of St. Vincent. After his return to <a href="../cathen/06407c.htm">Gembloux</a> he also wrote similar works for this <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, namely: a long poem on the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the Theban Legion, as <a href="../cathen/06407c.htm">Gembloux</a> had <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of its reputed leader Exuperius; a biography of the founder of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, Wicbert (d. 962); a history of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of <a href="../cathen/06407c.htm">Gembloux</a>, and revisions of the biographies of St. Maclovius and the two early <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, Theodard and Lambert.

<p>Later he became a violent imperial partisan in the great struggle between the empire and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. Of the three treatises which he contributed to the contest, one is lost; this was an answer to the letter of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, written in 1081 to Bishop Hermann of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> asserted that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> kings and to release subjects from the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of loyalty. In the second treatise Sigebert defended the masses of married <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the hearing of which had been forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1074. When Paschal II in 1103 ordered the Count of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> to punish the citizens of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> for their adherence to the emperor and to take up arms against him, Sigebert attacked the proceeding of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as unchristian and contrary to the Scriptures. His most celebrated work, "Chronicon sive Chronographia", is a chronicle of the world; it must be confessed that in this work he has not written history; he desired probably merely to give a chronological survey, consequently there is only a bare list of events even for the era in which he lived, though the last years, including 1105-11, are treated more in detail. The chronicle gained a very high reputation, was circulated in numberless copies, and was the basis of many later works of history. Notwithstanding various oversights and mistakes the industry and wide reading of Sigebert deserve honorable mention. He also made a catalogue of one hundred and seventy-one <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers and their works from <a href="../cathen/06417a.htm">Gennadius</a> to his own time, "De scriptoribus ecclesiasticis". In this list he mentions his own work.
