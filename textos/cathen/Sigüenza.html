<h1>Sig&uuml;enza</h1>  

<p>(SEGUNTINA, SEGONTIAE).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, suffragan of Toledo; bounded on the north by Soria, on the east by Saragossa and Teruel, on the south by Cuenca, and on the west by <a href="../cathen/07042b.htm">Guadalajara</a> and <a href="../cathen/13684b.htm">Segovia</a>. It lies in the civil provinces of <a href="../cathen/07042b.htm">Guadalajara</a>, <a href="../cathen/13684b.htm">Segovia</a>, Soria, and Saragossa. Its episcopal city has a population of 5000. The site of the ancient Segoncia, now called Villavieja, is at half a league distant from the present Sig&uuml;enza; Livy speaks of the town in treating of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of Cato with the Celtiberians. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is very ancient: the fictitious chronicles pretended that St. Sacerdos of <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a> had been its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; but, apart from these fables, we find Protogenes as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sig&uuml;enza at the Third Council of Toledo, and again the same Protogenes at Gundemar's council in 610; Ilsidclus assisted at the fourth, fifth, and sixth councils; Wideric, at the seventh to the tenth; Egica, at the eleventh; Ela, at the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth; Gunderic, at the fifteenth and sixteenth. The succession of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> continued under the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> domination: after St. Eulogius, in 851, we find there Sisemund, a man of great sagacity. But later on Sig&uuml;enza was so completely depopulated that it does not appear among the cities conquered by Alfonso VI when he subdued all this region. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Sig&uuml;enza, after it had been repeopled, was Bernardo, a native of <a href="../cathen/01209b.htm">Agen</a>, who had been "capisol" (<em>caput schola</em> &mdash; schoolmaster) of Toledo; he rebuilt the church and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> it on the Feast of St. Stephen, 1123, and placed in it a chapter of canons regular. He died Bishop-elect of Santiago. On 14 March, 1140, Alfonso VII granted the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the lordship of Sig&uuml;enza, which his successors retained until the fourteenth century.

<p>After the long episcopate of Bernardo, Pedro succeeded, and was succeeded by Cerebruno, who began the building of the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Jocelin, an Englishman, was present with the king at the conquest of Cuenca; he was succeeded by Arderico, who was transferred to Palencia; Martin de Hinojosa, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Huerta, abdicated the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1192, and was succeeded by Rodrigo.

<p>Sig&uuml;enza took a large part in the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The fortress palace of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was captured in 1297 by the partisans of the Infantes de la Cerda, and in 1355 it was the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> of the unhappy Blanche of Bourbon, consort of Pedro the Cruel. In 1465 Diego L&oacute;pez of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, having usurped the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>, fortified himself there. Pedro Gonzalez de Mendoza, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, held this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> together with that of Toledo, and enriched his relations by providing establishments for them at Sig&uuml;enza. His successor, <a href="../cathen/03393a.htm">Cardinal Bernardino de Carvajal</a>, was dispossessed, as a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> by <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>, for his share in the Conciliabulum of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>. After that <a href="../cathen/09316c.htm">Garcia de Loaisa</a>, Fernando Vald&eacute;s, Pedro Paeheco, and others held this wealthy see. The castle-palace, modified in various ways, suffered much from the storms of civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and was restored by Joaquin Fernandez Cortina, who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from 1848, and the restoration was continued by Bishop Gomez Salazar (1876-79).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is a very massive Gothic edifice of ashlar stone. Its <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> has three doors, with a railed court in front. At the sides rise two square towers, 164 feet high, with merlons topped with large balls; these towers are connected by a balustrade which crowns the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>, the work of Bishop Herrera in the eighteenth century. The interior is divided into three Gothic <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a>. The main choir begins in the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> with a <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> altar built by order of Bishop Mateo de <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> is the Chapel of St. Librada, patroness of the city, with a splendid reredos and the relics of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, all constructed at the expense of Bishop Fadrique de <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, who is buried there. What is now the Chapel of St. Catherine was dedicated to <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas of Canterbury</a> by the English Bishop Jocelin, who came with Queen Leonora. Cardinal Mendoza is <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the main choir. Beyond the choir proper, which is situated in the centre, there is the sumptuous altar of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora la Mayor. Connected with the church is a beautiful Florid Gothic <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, the work of <a href="../cathen/03393a.htm">Bernardino de Carvajal</a>. The rich tabernacle, with its golden <a href="../cathen/11344a.htm">monstrance</a>, was given by Cardinal Mendoza. The <a href="../cathen/03584a.htm">chapter house</a> contains many excellent <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>. It is not known with any <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> at what period this church was begun, though it appears to date from the end of the twelfth century. The image of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora la Mayor, to whom the church is dedicated, dates from the end of the twelfth century; it was taken to the retro-choir in the fifteenth century, the Assumption being substituted for it on the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>.

<p>The Conciliar Seminary of San Bartolom&eacute; is due to Bishop Bartolom&eacute; Santos de Risoba (1651). There is a smaller <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, that of the Immaculate Conception, and a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>. The College of <a href="../cathen/13424b.htm">San Antonio</a> el Grande is a beautiful building. It was formerly a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, founded in 1476 by the wealthy; Juan L&oacute;pez de Medina, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of Alm&aacute;z&aacute;n, but its prosperity was hindered by the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">University of Alcal&aacute;</a>; in 1770 it was reduced to a few chairs of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and was suppressed in 1837. Worthy of mention are the ancient hermitage of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora, which, according to tradition, had been originally the pro-cathedral; the Humilladero, a small Gothic hermitage; the Churrigueresque <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>; the modern <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, which was formerly the home of the choir boys; the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of the military barracks; and the <a href="../cathen/07345a.htm">Hieronymite</a> college.
<h2>University of Siguenza</h2>

<p>The building of the College of <a href="../cathen/13424b.htm">San Antonio</a> Portaceli of Sig&uuml;enza, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, which was later transformed into a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, was begun in 1476. Its founder was Don Juan L&oacute;pez de Medina, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of Alm&aacute;z&aacute;n, canon of Toledo, and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of Sig&uuml;enza. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> ratifying the foundation, approving the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, etc., was granted by <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> in 1483, and courses were opened in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, canon law, and arts. By a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a> in 1489, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was created, with powers to confer the degrees of bachelor, licentiate, and doctor; the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was thus transformed into a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. A <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> issued by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> extended the course in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and, during the rectorate of Maestro Velosillo, the chairs of physics were created, while a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> established the faculties of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and of medicine. Among the professors were Pedro Ciruelo, who enhanced the prestige of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> as a centre of learning; Don Francisco Delgado, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09417b.htm">Lugo</a>, who was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, and under whom the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> reached its period of greatest splendour; Don Fernando Velosillo, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> and professor, was sent by Philip II to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. There were also present at that council, as <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, Don Antonio Torres, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03243a.htm">Canary Islands</a>, and Senor Torro, both professors of this <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>; Don Pedro Guerrero, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a>; the famous Cuesta; Tricio and Francisco Alvarez, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sig&uuml;enza. It is thus evident that the influence of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of Sig&uuml;enza in <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> was considerable in the last years of the fifteenth century and the first years of the sixteenth; thereafter it fell into decay. It was suppressed in 1837.
