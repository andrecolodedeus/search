<h1>Simon Islip</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, b. at Islip, near Oxford; d. at Mayfield, Sussex, 26 April, 1366. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, where he proceeded doctor in canon, and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, being elected Fellow of Merton in 1307. His talents and learning as <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> lawyer soon won for him many <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> and preferments. Having for a time been <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of Easton, near Stamford, he exchanged this place in 1332 for the archdeaconry of Stow, which he only held for one year. He also held the rectory of Horncastle. Bishop Burghersh of Lincoln, then treasurer and Chancellor of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, made him a <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebendary</a> of Lincoln Cathedral in 1327, and he held successively the <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a> of Welton Brinkhall, Aylesbury, and Welton Beckhall, while in 1337 he became <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> for the diocese. At this time he was much in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> where he entered the king's service as one of the royal <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>. <a href="../cathen/05321a.htm">Edward III</a> trusted him also in diplomatic and political affairs, appointed him a member of the council and in 1346 gave Islip extensive powers during his own absence in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In 1343 he had been made <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and subsequently he was made dean of arches. He also held the <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebend</a> of Mora in St. Paul's Cathedral and a stall at <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a>. John Stratford, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, died in 1348 while the Black Death was raging. His two successors, John Ufford and <a href="../cathen/14693b.htm">Thomas Bradwardine</a>, died of the plague within a few weeks of each other, the former before <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. On 20 Sept. 1349, Simon Islip was elected <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, but within three weeks the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> conferred the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> on him by provision. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> just before <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> and received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> at the following <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. The archdiocese had suffered from the pestilence and there was a dearth of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, so that the first work Islip was called on to undertake was a visitation, during which he laboured with energy to restore <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>.

<p>At this time, and after the renewed outbreak of the Black Death in 1362, he took particular pains to regulate the stipends of the unbeneficed <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, who were induced by the greatly diminished number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to exact higher remuneration for their services than formerly. He next succeeded in terminating the ancient dispute between the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and York, as to the right of the latter to bear his cross in the province of the former. The final arrangement, suggested by the king, agreed to by both <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, and confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, was that the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a> might carry his cross in the province of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> on condition that each <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> should within two months of his confirmation present to the shrine of St. Thomas a golden image of an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Though he was a favourite of the king, he did not hesitate to resist royal exactions, and he addressed a vigorous remonstrance on the subject to <a href="../cathen/05321a.htm">Edward III</a>. This being supported by the action of a synod over which the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> presided, and which refused the king's demand for a tenth of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> income for six years, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> effectual to check the corrupt system of purveyance. Copies of this remonstrance, the "Speculum Regis Edwardi", are in the Bodleian <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> (<a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> 624) and the British Museum (Harl. <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> 2399; Cotton <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, Cleopatra D. IX and Faustina B. i.). Islip was a munificent benefactor of <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">Oxford University</a>, and founded a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> which he intended should afford special facilities for <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to obtain the advantages of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> course, but the difficulties <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> insurmountable, and after his death his foundation continued as a dependence on Christ Church, <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, until it was absorbed by <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Cardinal Wolsey</a>, in his foundation of Christ Church, <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">Oxford</a>. During his lifetime he had the reputation of being a sparing and niggardly administrator of the temporalities of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, but this seems to be explained partly by the nature of the times, which called for economy and the wise husbandry of resources, and partly by his own temperament, which was frugal and averse to display. Both his <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthronement</a> and his funeral at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> were by his own desire marked by the utmost simplicity, but his generous bequests to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> show that this was not due to lack of interest in his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>. In 1363 the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> suffered a paralytic stroke which he survived for three years, although by depriving him of the power of speech, it practically closed his career.
