<h1>Simon Langham</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and Chancellor of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, b. at Langham in Rutland; d. at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon, France</a>, 22 July, 1376.

<p>Nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of his early life, but in 1346 he was already a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster Abbey</a>, representing his house in the triennial chapter. In April, 1349, he was made prior, and in May he became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. In this office he <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> very successful, ruling well and carrying out many works, including the completion of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a>. He became treasurer of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> on 21 Nov., 1360, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a> on 10 Jan., 1362. Before <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> he was also elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, but he refused this see, preferring Ely. On 19 Feb., 1363, he received the great seal as chancellor, and he was the first to speak in English when opening Parliament. He was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> on 24 July, 1366, and received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on 4 Nov., having previously resigned the chancellorship. As <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> he was vigilant against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a>, condemned certain propositions taught at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, removed one Wycliffe&mdash;not the <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">well-known heretic</a> of that name&mdash;from the headship of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> Hall, and censured the demagogue-priest, John Ball. Blessed <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban V</a> created him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of St. Sixtus, 27 Sept., 1368. His acceptance of this dignity without the king's leave offended <a href="../cathen/05321a.htm">Edward III</a>, who seized the Canterbury revenues on the plea that Langham had by his act forfeited the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Langham resigned the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> on 27 Nov., and early in 1369 joined the Pope at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, being succeeded at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> by Whittlesey. Subsequently he regained the king's favor, but did not return to his native country, though he held several English preferments in succession, such as the archdeaconries of Wells and Taunton. <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> made him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11421a.htm">Palestrina</a> in July, 1373, and in the following year the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> again elected him as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> refused to confirm this, alleging that he could not spare the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> from <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> was about to return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1376, Langham obtained permission to go back to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but he died before he could carry out this intention. Three years after his death, his remains were translated from <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> to <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster Abbey</a> to which he had bequeathed his residuary estate. He was an upright man, and an able, if stern, ruler.
