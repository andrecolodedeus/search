<h1>Simon Le Moyne</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary, b. at <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Beauvais</a>, 1604; d. in 1665 at Cap de la Madeleine, near <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a>. He joined the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> in 1622, and reached <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> in 1638. He worked on the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> mission with <a href="../cathen/03645a.htm">Chaumonot</a>, <a href="../cathen/02766a.htm">Bressani</a>, and the future <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Second to <a href="../cathen/03645a.htm">Chaumonot</a> alone in his mastery of the Huron-<a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> language, he was unequalled in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the character of the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indians</a> their customs and traditions, even the artifices of their savage eloquence and diplomacy. The ascendancy he thereby enjoyed made him a desirable ambassador on all delicate and arduous occasions. He was the first <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> to penetrate among the Onondagas, where his eloquence and acquaintance with their traditions won their admiration. They begged for a missionary to teach them about the Great Spirit (1654). His second mission was to the fierce Mohawks, the murderers of <a href="../cathen/08420b.htm">Father Jogues</a>, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">jealous</a> of the favour shown to the Onondagas. They received him well, and he journeyed to Manhattan or <a href="../cathen/11020a.htm">New Amsterdam</a>, where the governor, Peter Stuyvesant, treated him courteously. When a fresh outburst of Mohawk jealousy threatened to disturb the peace, Le Moyne again volunteered to pacify them, visiting <a href="../cathen/02111b.htm">Ossernenon</a> a second and third time, and, though outwardly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a>, he frequently faced death. When after two years of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> against the French and their allies the Cayuga <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> sued for peace in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, and craved for a "black gown", Le Moyne went to test their sincerity (1661). This was his fifth embassy and during it he was seized, tortured, and even condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>. He was always ready for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. He owed his preservation to the chief Garakonti&eacute;, whom <a href="../cathen/09045a.htm">Bishop Laval</a> had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. He consoled the Indians and French captives, many of whom owed him their release. When the regular missions were established he longed to return to the Onondagas, but death overtook him at Cap de la Madeleine. Garakonti&eacute; eloquently eulogized his undaunted <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and eminent <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.
