<h1>Simon Starowolski</h1>  

<p>Born at Stara Wola, near <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, 1585; died at <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, 1656; studied at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, but took his degrees in the <a href="../cathen/04465a.htm">University of Cracow</a>, after which he travelled in various countries of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Returning, he taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04465a.htm">University of Cracow</a>, and then became secretary to Chodkiewicz, whom he accompanied on his expedition to Chocim. For years he was a tutor to young noblemen, and again went over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in this capacity with the Hetman Koniecpolski's son. In 1639 he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and subsequently became a canon in <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> siege (1655) he administered the diocese for Bishop Gebicki, and it became his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to show the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> king. When he pointed to the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Lokietek who, he said, thrice an exile, had returned thrice, Charles Gustavus remarked that "John Casimir would never return". "Serenissime Rex", he replied, "fortuna variabilis, Deus immutabilis." He died some months later, before John Casimir's triumphant return.

<p>Starowolski wrote most abundantly and on every possible subject &mdash; history, geography, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, strategy, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and politics. His province also embraced literature, for his "Scriptorum Polonicorum Hecatontas" is a short biography of Polish authors, with the titles of their works. This he wrote during his travels abroad, where he published it in Latin, to instruct foreigners in Polish matters. At the same time he wrote books in Polish, chiefly of a moral character, and many <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> treatises; also two collections of sermons entitled: "The Lord's Sanctuary" and "The Ark of the Testament". His chief political works are: an exhortation to put down the Tatars; "The True Knight"; and three works intended to reform Polish <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, with different titles, and in different degrees of elaboration. Last, and shortly before his death, appeared his famous though short "Lament of the dying Mother, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, over her undutiful sons"; from <a href="../cathen/14034a.htm">Skarga's</a> days to those of <a href="../cathen/10283a.htm">Mickiewicz</a>, no equally lofty expression of patriotism appeared. Starowolski wrote more than sixty books; but those mentioned suffice to give an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the extent of his learning, intelligence, assiduity, and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for his country's welfare. In the commonwealth, tottering to its fall, he was one of the most public-spirited men; possibly there was not a single <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> which he did not denounce. And thus, though no genius, he is most worthy of respect, and is the principal literary figure of those times. As a writer, perhaps on account of his numerous works, he is neither very correct nor very brilliant; yet at times (as in the Lament), under the influence of his indignation, he rises to heights of thrilling eloquence. As a political writer, he possesses the quality of sound common sense, and not unfrequently succeeds in pointing out the right means of saving the State. On the whole, he is somewhat more of a moralist than of a politician; at all events, in his writings, the reform of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> takes up a larger place than the regeneration of the commonwealth.
