<h1>Simon Vigor</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and controversialist, b. at <a href="../cathen/05671a.htm">Evreux</a>, <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, about 1515; d. at <a href="../cathen/03331b.htm">Carcassonne</a>, 1 Nov., 1575. Son of Raynaud Vigor, a court physician, he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> about 1520, where his studies included Greek, Hebrew, and Latin; later he devoted himself to <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. Admitted to the College of Navarre in 1540, in the same year he became <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>. In 1545 he became a doctor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and was appointed penitentiary of Evereux. Thenceforth he devoted himself to pastoral and controversial preaching with great success. He was called upon to speak at <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, Paris, <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, and elsewhere. When conferences took place at Saint-Germain near <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1562) between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> defended by Theodore Beza and others, Vigor was one of those chosen to defend the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause in the name of the Sorbonne. In 1563 he was among the twelve <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> representing the Sorbonne at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, where he took part in the discussions on <a href="../cathen/04001a.htm">clandestine marriages</a> and <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, and distinguished himself by his vast erudition. He was instrumental in cementing amicable relations between <a href="../cathen/07473a.htm">Cardinal Hosius</a> of <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to the council, and Francisco Torres (Turrianus), and won the confidence of <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm#iv">Cardinal de Lorraine</a> whom he accompanied on his visit (Feb., 1563) to Ferdinand I at <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a>.

<p>On his return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> Vigor became <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the Church of St. Paul-de-Paris, the royal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of the chapter of Notre-Dame, and court preacher. He persevered in his combat against the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> with an ardour which drew on him for some of his propositions (March, 1564) if not the censure, at least the displeasure, of the Sorbonne. He converted several of them, among others the learned Pierre Pithou, the Varo of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. After preaching a <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> at <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, he stated that at his arrival he had found there more than 800 <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and at his departure there remained only forty. In 1566 he held, together with Claude de Sainctes, against the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> Jean de l'Epine and Sureau de Rosier, a conference of which the acts were printed (Paris, 1582). According to G&eacute;n&eacute;brard the defeat of the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> was so overwhelming that the subsequent <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> synod forbade conferences to be held thenceforth with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. These successes had made Vigor famous when in 1572 <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> raised him to the See of Narbonne. After his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> he went to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and began at once to eradicate the evils his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> had suffered, in being long without a resident <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He never returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> or to his home, being wholly engaged in converting the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of his own and the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, in which work death overtook him. After his death the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Rennes</a> in a letter to <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> called him the <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> or Hilary of his time, and Duval praised him as a model of learning and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, a pillar of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. There were edited after his death five volumes of his "Sermons ou pr&eacute;dications chr&eacute;tiennes et catholiques" (Paris, 1577-88); several times reprinted.
