<h1>Simon William Gabriel Brut&eacute; de R&eacute;mur</h1>  

<p>First <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vincennes, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, U.S.A. (now Indianapolis), b. at <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Rennes</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 20 March 1779; d. at Vincennes, 26 June, 1839. His father was Simon-Guillaume-Gabriel Brut&eacute; de Remur, of an ancient and respectable <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and Superintendent of the Royal Domains in Brittany; and his mother, Jeanne-Renee Le Saulnier de Vauhelle Vater, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Francis Vater, printer to the King and Parliament at <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Rennes</a>. Young Brut&eacute; had attended the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of his native city several years when the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> interrupted his studies. He then learned and practised the business of a compositor in the printing establishment of his mother, where she placed him to avoid his enrolment in a regiment of children who took part in the fusillades of the Reign of Terror. This did not prevent his witnessing many horrible and exciting scenes, and in his diary he mentions having been present at the trial and precipitate execution of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and nobles in the cause of their religion. He frequented the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a> and made friends of the guards, who admitted him to the cells, where he received and delivered letters for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> incarcerated there. More than once he bore in his bosom to these suffering heroes the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>.

<p>In 1796 Brut&eacute; began the study of <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a>, and in spite of the avowed infidelity then prevalent in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, he remained <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> against sophistry and ridicule. He was graduated in 1803, but did not practice medicine, as he immediately entered upon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies, which he pursued for four years at the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on the 11th of June, 1808, he joined the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Society of Saint-Sulpice</a> and, after teaching <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> for two years, he sailed for the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> with Bishop-elect Flaget (1810). At St. Mary's Seminary, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, he taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> for two years and then was sent for a short time to the Eastern Shore of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. He was transferred thence to Mt. St. Mary's Emmitsburg, where he taught and at the same time performed the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of that vicinity with such devotion that he became known as the "Angel of the Mount". During this period he became the <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a> of Mother Seton, foundress of the Sisters of Charity in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> with whom he maintained a lifelong friendship.

<p>In 1815 he was appointed President of St. Mary's College, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, but after three years (1818) he returned to Emmitsburg. In 1826, Mt. St. Mary's College being no longer dependent upon the Fathers of Saint-Sulpice, its founders, Father Brut&eacute; ceased to belong to that <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, but continued his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> at the "Mountain" until 1834, when he was appointed to the newly created See of Vincennes. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in St. Louis, October the 28th, 1834, by the Right Rev. Benedict J. Flaget, Bishops Rosati and <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">Purcell</a> assisting. After travelling over his vast diocese, comprising the whole <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">State of Indiana</a> and eastern Illinois, Bishop Brut&eacute; visited <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where he secured <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and funds for the erection of churches and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in his needy diocese.

<p>Bishop Brut&eacute; left no published work except some ephemeral contributions, which, over the pseudonym "Vincennes", appeared in various journals, notably the Cincinnati "Catholic Telegraph". It is to be regretted that he did not write an autobiography, for which his Memoranda, notes, and Diary seem a preparation. They teem with interest, and show him to have been the friend of famous men in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Conspicuous among the number was <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">de Lamennais</a>, whom he tried to reconcile with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> both by his letters from this country, as well as by conferring with him personally during one of his visits to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but without success.
