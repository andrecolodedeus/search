<h1>Simon de Montfort</h1>  

<p>An Earl of Leicester, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown, died at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, 25 June, 1218. Simon (IV) de Montfort was descended from the lords of Montfort l'Amaury in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, being the second son of Simon (III), and Amicia, daughter of Robert de Beaumont, third Earl of Leicester. Having succeeded his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> as Baron de Montfort in 1181, in 1190 he married Alice de Montmorency, the daughter of Bouchard (III) de Montmorency. In 1199 while taking part in a tournament at Ecry-sur-Aisne in the province of Champagne he heard Fulk de Neuilly preaching the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, and in company with <a href="../cathen/14634c.htm">Count Thibaud de Champagne</a> and many other nobles and <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> he took the cross. Unfortunately, the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> got out of control, and the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, instead of co-operating with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, decided on a campaign in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and on their arrival at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> entered on a contract for transport across the Mediterranean. Being unable to fulfil the terms of the contract, they compounded by assisting the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> to capture <a href="../cathen/15752a.htm">Zara</a> in <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>. In vain the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> urged them to set out for the Holy Land. They preferred to march on Constantinople, though Simon de Montfort offered energetic opposition to this proposal. Notwithstanding his efforts, the expedition was undertaken and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> plans were defeated.

<p>In 1204 or 1205 Simon succeeded to the Earldom of Leicester and large estates in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, for on the death of the fourth Earl of Leicester in that year, his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Leicester devolved on his sister Alicia, Simon's mother; and as her husband, Simon (III), and her eldest son were already dead, the earldom devolved on Simon himself. But though he was recognized by King John as Earl of Leicester, he was never formally invested with the earldom, and in February, 1207, the king seized all his English estates on pretext of a <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> due from him. Shortly afterwards they were restored, only to be confiscated again before the end of the year. Simon, content with the Norman estates he had inherited from the de Montforts and the de Beaumonts, remained in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where in 1208 he was made captain-general of the French forces in the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>. At first he declined this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, Arnold, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, ordered him in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> name to accept it, and he obeyed.

<p>Simon thus received control over the territory conquered from Raymond (VI) of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> and by his military skill, fierce <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and ruthlessness he swept the country. His success won for him the admiration of the English barons, and in 1210 King John received information that they were plotting to elect Simon King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in his stead. Simon, however, concentrated his fierce energies on his task in <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, and in 1213 he defeated Peter of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> at the battle of Muret. The <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a> were now crushed, but Simon carried on the campaign as a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of conquest, being appointed by the Council of <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a> lord over all the newly-acquired territory, as Count of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> and Duke of Narbonne (1215). The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> confirmed this appointment, understanding that it would effectually complete the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. It is ever to be deplored that Simon stained his many great qualities by treachery, harshness, and bad <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. His severity became cruelty, and he delivered over many towns to fire and pillage, thus involving many innocent people in the common ruin. This is the more to be regretted, as his intrepid <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the severe virtue of his private life, and his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and skill in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> marked him out as a great man.

<p>Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had been making efforts to secure for him the restitution of his English estates. The surrender of his lands by John was one of the conditions for reconciliation laid down by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1213; but it was not till July, 1215, that John reluctantly yielded the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Leicester into the hands of Simon's nephew, Ralph, Earl of <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>, "for the benefit of the said Simon". Simon's interest in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was shown by his efforts to dissuade Louis of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> from invading <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in July, 1216, in which matter he was seconded, though fruitlessly, by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> Gualo. Having at this time raised more troops in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Simon returned to the south of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where he occupied himself in waging <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> at <a href="../cathen/11083a.htm">N&icirc;mes</a>, until in 1217 a rebellion broke out in Provence, where Count Raymond's son re-entered <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. Simon hastened to besiege the city, but was hampered by lack of troops. On 25 June, 1218, while he was at Mass he learned that the besieged had made a sortie. Refusing to leave the church before Mass was over, he arrived late at the scene of action only to be wounded mortally. He expired, commending his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and was buried in the Monastery of Haute-Bruy&egrave;re. He left three sons, of whom Almeric the eldest ultimately inherited his French estates; the youngest was Simon de Montfort, who succeeded him as Earl of Leicester, and who was to play so great a part in English history.
