<h1>Simon of Sudbury</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, b. at Sudbury, Suffolk, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, of middle-class <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; d. at <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 14 June, 1381. After taking a degree in law at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, he proceeded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, became <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to <a href="../cathen/08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a>, and was sent to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> as <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> to <a href="../cathen/05321a.htm">Edward III</a> in 1356. In 1361 Sudbury was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, after being chancellor at <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>. He was busy with John of Gaunt over negotiations with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1372-73, and while complaints were made that his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> was neglected, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> enriched his native town by building and endowing a collegiate church on the site of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> old house. Sudbury succeeded <a href="../cathen/08788b.htm">Langham</a> as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> in 1375, and his friendship with John of Gaunt and the Lancastrian party at once brought him into opposition with Courtenay, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15641a.htm">William of Wykeham</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>. Sudbury was an amiable but not a strong man and John of Gaunt's support of <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a> made the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> reluctant to proceed against the latter. Courtenay's pressure forced <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a> to be summoned before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in 1377, but <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a>, who had not yet incurred a formal charge of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, had Lancaster and the influence of the court at his back, and escaped condemnation. Archbishop Sudbury became lord chancellor in 1380, on the resignation of Scrope, and this acceptance of office cost him his life a year later at the great uprising of the peasants.

<p>On 11 June, 1381, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was with Richard II and his <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> in the Tower of London, when the peasants marched on the capital. On 14 June, while Richard was holding conference with Wat Tyler at Mile End, and agreeing to the demands of the peasants, a crowd invaded the Tower crying "Where is the traitor to the kingdom? Where is the spoiler of the commons?" "Neither a traitor, nor despoiler am I, but thy archbishop", came the reply. In vain the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> warned the mob that heavy punishment would follow his death; the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the people against all whom they judged responsible for the poll-tax left no room in their hearts for mercy. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was dragged from his chamber to Tower Hill, and there with many blows his head was struck off &#151; to be placed on <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Bridge, according to the savage custom of the time. A few days later, when the rising was over, the head was taken down, and with the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> body, removed to <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> for burial. It was said that Sudbury, when <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, had discouraged <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> to the shrine of St. Thomas at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>; he was known to be the friend of John of Lancaster, and he had <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> John Ball, the peasant leader, as his predecessors had done, at Maidstone. But the fact that he was chancellor was the real cause of Sudbury's violent death. Nevertheless, there were many who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> the mild and gentle <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, and who counted him a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>.
