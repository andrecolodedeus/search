<h1>Simone Martini</h1>  

<p>(Also known as SIMONE DI MARTINO, and as SIMONE MEMMI).

<p>Sienese <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, born in <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, 1283; died either in the same place or at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> in 1344 or 1349. This artist is now declared to have been a direct pupil of <a href="../cathen/05181c.htm">Duccio</a>, whom he surpassed in the decorative quality of his work <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> states that he was a pupil of <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a>, but this statement is refuted by an examination of Simone's works, and also by all the evidence that has been gathered regarding the <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienese</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The earliest of Simone's authentic works is his great fresco in <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> Virgin and Child, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> originally in 1315, and restored by the master himself in 1321, after it had suffered damage from damp. In 1320 he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> an <a href="../cathen/01356a.htm">altar-piece</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Catherine at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, which has now been taken to pieces, and although the greater part is in the Academy at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, two other portions are in other buildings in the same city. In the following year he was at <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> an <a href="../cathen/01356a.htm">altar-piece</a> for the church of San Dominico which is now preserved in a museum of that city, and then he returned to <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, where he was busily engaged in 1328 on his splendid portrait of Fogliano, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of that general's capture of Montemassi. A little later on we hear of him at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, where he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> a wonderful series of works relating to the life of St. Martin, adorning the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Martin in the church of San Francesco. The latter part of his life was passed at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> in the service of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court then resident in that place, and there he decorated various portions of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and several <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> and rooms in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> palace. It was in <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> that he met <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a>, and there <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> the portrait, so famous in later years, of Madonna Laura.

<p>He is said to have <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> a portrait at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> of <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a> himself, commissioned by Pandolfo Malatesta, but if he did this, it was during an earlier visit to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and respecting it we have not much information. We are only certain concerning his second visit to the place after having been called by <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Pope Clement VI</a>. The exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his funeral is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by certain <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienese</a> records as 4 August, 1344, but the record is not sufficiently clear as to whether his body was transported from <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> to <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> for burial, or whether he actually died in <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>. There are several of his works in the city of his birth, one at the Louvre, one in <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, an exceedingly fine one at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, and a remarkable signed and dated picture at <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>. In the museum at Altenburg there is one of his works, and there are at least three in private collections in America. The portrait of <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a> attributed to him was sold in 1867 at the Poniatowski sale, and at the same sale there was sold a portrait of Laura, which was undoubtedly his work.
