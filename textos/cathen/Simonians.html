<h1>Simonians</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, <a href="../cathen/01564b.htm">Antinomian</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the second century which regarded <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> as its founder and which traced its doctrines back to him. The Simonians are mentioned by Hegesippus (in Eusebius, <a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.22</a>); their doctrines are quoted and opposed in connection with <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> by <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103123.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> I.23</a>), by the "Philosophumena" (VI, ix-xx; X, xii), and later by Epiphanius ("Haer.", xxii). In the "Philosophumena" Simon's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is described according to his reputed work, "The Great Declaration"; it is evident that we have here the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> opinions of the Simonians as they had developed in the second century. According to these there was a perfect, eternal ungenerated being (fire), that contained an invisible, hidden element and a visible, manifest element; the hidden is concealed in the manifest; the action of both is similar to that of the intelligible and the sensible in <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. From that which remains concealed of the ungenerated being six roots (powers) emanated in pairs and these pairs correspond at the same time to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, sun and moon, air and water. In their potentiality is contained the entire power. This unlimited power is the "Standing One" (<em>estos</em>), the seventh root (power) corresponding to the seventh day after the six days of creation. This seventh power existed before the world, it is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> that moved upon the face of the waters (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#vrs2">Genesis 1:2</a>). When it does not remain in the six roots (in potentiality), but is actually developed in the world, it is then in substance, magnitude, and perfection the same as the unlimited power of the ungenerated being (<a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> emanation). As the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> side of the original being appears the "thought" or "conception" (<em>ennoia</em>), which is the mother of the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">aeons</a>. The "Standing One" is regarded as containing both sexes. The first six "powers" are followed by other less important emanations: archangels, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">demiurge</a> who fashions the world, who is also the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The jealousy of the inferior spirits seems to have forced the "Ennoia" to take <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> forms and to migrate from one body into another, until <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>, the great power sent forth by the original being, discovered her in <a href="../cathen/07203a.htm">Helena</a> and released her. The deliverance was wrought by his being recognized as the highest power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the "Standing One". Men are also saved by accepting Simon's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, by recognizing him as the great power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> and its law, by which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> was only brought into bondage, was opposed (<a href="../cathen/01564b.htm">antinomianism</a>) as the work of the inferior god of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>). The Simonians used magic and theurgy, incantations, and love-potions; they declared <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> a matter of indifference that was neither good nor bad, proclaimed fornication to be perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and led very disorderly, immoral lives. In general, they regarded nothing in itself as good or bad by nature. It was not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> that made men blessed, in the next world, but the grace bestowed by Simon and Helena on those who united with them. The Simonians <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> and worshiped Simon under the image of Zeus, and Helena under that of Athene. The <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> flourished in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, in various districts of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> and at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In the third century remnants of it still existed (<a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="../fathers/04161.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> I.57</a> and <a href="../fathers/04166.htm">VI.11</a>), which survived until the fourth century. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250102.htm"><em>Church History</em> II.13</a>) calls the Simonians the most immoral and depraved of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. Closely connected with them were the <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheans</a> and Menandrians, who should be regarded probably as branches of the Simonians. Their names came from <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheus</a> and Meander, of whom the first, a <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>, was originally the teacher and then the pupil of <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>, while Menander was a pupil and, after Simon's death, his most important successor. <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheus</a> is said to have opposed <a href="../cathen/01564b.htm">antinomianism</a>, that is, the rejection of <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> law. As late as the beginning of the seventh century <a href="../cathen/05603c.htm">Eulogius of Alexandria</a> (in Photius, "Bibliotheca cod.", 230) opposed <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheans</a> who regarded <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheus</a> as the great <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> foretold by Moses. <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheus</a> died a tragic death from starvation ("Pseudo-Clemen. Recognitions," I, 57, 72; II, 11; <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="../fathers/04161.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> I.57</a> and <a href="../fathers/04166.htm">VI.11</a>; <a href="../fathers/04124.htm"><em>De Principiis</em> IV.17</a>; "In Matth. Comm.", XXXII, P.L., XIII, 1643; "In Luc. Hom.", XXV, ibid., 1866; Epiphanius, "Haer.", XX). Like Simon, Menander also proclaimed himself to be the one sent of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>. In the same way he taught the creation of the world by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who were sent by the Ennoia. He asserted that men received <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> by his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and practiced magical arts. The <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> named after him, the Menandrians, continued to exist for a considerable length of time.
