<h1>Simplicius, Faustinus, and Beatrice</h1>  

<p>Martyrs at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> during the <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> (302 or 303). The brothers Simplicius and Faustinus were cruelly tortured on account of their <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a>, beaten with clubs, and finally beheaded; their bodies were thrown into the Tiber. According to another version of the legend a stone was tied to them and they were drowned. Their sister Beatrice had the bodies drawn out of the water and buried. Then for seven months she lived with a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> matron named Lucina, and with her aid Beatrice succoured the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> by day and night. Finally she was discovered and arrested. Her accuser was her neighbor Lucretius who desired to obtain possession of her lands. She <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageously</a> asserted before the judge that she would never sacrifice to demons, because she was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. As punishment, she was strangled in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. Her friend Lucina buried her by her brothers in the cemetery <em>ad Ursum Pileatum</em> on the road to Porto. Soon after this Divine punishment overtook the accuser Lucretius. When Lucretius at a feast was making merry over the folly of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, an infant who had been brought to the entertainment by his mother, cried out, "Thou hast committed <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and hast taken <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> possession of land. Thou art a slave of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>". And the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> at once took possession of him and tortured him three hours and drew him down into the bottomless pit. The terror of those present was so great that they became <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. This is the story of the legend. Trustworthy Acts concerning the history of the two brothers and sister are no longer in existence. <a href="../cathen/09157a.htm">Pope Leo II</a> (682-683) translated their <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> to a church which he had built at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. Later the greater part of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were taken to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Maggiore.

<p>St. Simplicius is represented with a pennant, on the shield of which are three lilies called the crest of Simplicius; the lilies are a symbol of purity of heart. St. Beatrice has a cord in her hand, because she was strangled. The <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the three <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is on 29 July.
