<p>DIOCESE OF SINALOA (SINALOENSIS)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10250b.htm">Republic of Mexico</a>, suffragan of the <a href="../cathen/05208c.htm">Archdiocese of Durango</a>. Its area is that of the State of Sinaloa, 27,552 sq. miles, and its population (1910) 323,499. Culiacan, the capital of the state and residence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and governor, counts a population (1910) of 13,578. The present territory of Sinaloa was discovered in 1530 by the ill-reputed D. Nu&ntilde;o de Guzman who founded the city of San Miguel de Culiacan. A few <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> established a colony there. The province of Culiacan was soon obliged to face the terrors of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> brought upon it by the barbarous cruelties of Nu&ntilde;o and his favourite, Diego Hernandez de Proa&ntilde;o. So frightened was Nu&ntilde;o by the terrible insurrection that he removed Proa&ntilde;o, placing in his stead Crist&oacute;bal de Tapia, whose humanitarian measures slowly restored confidence. Although colonized from the beginning of the sixteenth century, most of the territory, excepting a few strong places, was inhabited by fierce <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> tribes, for whose <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> laboured early in the seventeenth century. After having subdued and evangelized the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indians</a> of the mission of Piaxtla in a comparatively short time, and after having turned over to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05208c.htm">Durango</a> the settlements under their control, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> extended their domination over the Indians living in the northern part of the actual state and at the time of their expulsion (by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of Charles III) they fruitfully administered the missions of Chinipas and Sinaloa. In Chinipas they had residences at Guasarapes, Santa Ana, Secora, Moris, Barbaroco, Santa Ines, Serocagui, Tubares, Sateb&oacute;, Baborigame, Nabogame, and San Andres; in Sinaloa (misi&oacute;n del Fuerte) they had residences at Mocorito, Nio, Guazave, Chicorato, Mochicave, Batacosa, Conicari, Tehueco, Ocoroni, and Bacubirito. It is notable that the towns of the misi&oacute;n del Rio Yaqui, which now belong to the <a href="../cathen/14145a.htm">Diocese of Sonora</a>, were then included in the mission of Sinaloa. When the See of <a href="../cathen/05208c.htm">Durango</a> was founded in 1620, Sinaloa, which until then had belonged to the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/07042b.htm">Guadalajara</a>, became part of it; on the foundation (1780) of the <a href="../cathen/14145a.htm">Diocese of Sonora</a>, it became a part of the latter. However, the residence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, after having been successively at Arispe and Alamo, passed to Culiacan, capital of Sinaloa until 1883, when <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> founded the Diocese of Sinaloa, which had formed part of the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of <a href="../cathen/07042b.htm">Guadalajara</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14145a.htm">Sonora</a> removed to Hermosillo. In 1891, when the new archiepiscopal See of <a href="../cathen/05208c.htm">Durango</a> was created, Sinaloa became one of its suffragans.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has 1 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> with 18 students; 10 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; 3 <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a> with 677 students.
