<h1>Sion</h1>  

<p>(Sedunensis)</p>

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, depending directly on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>The Diocese of Sion is the oldest in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> and one of the oldest north of the Alps. At first its see was at Octodurum, now called Martinach, or Martigny. According to tradition there was a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Octodurum, named Oggerius, as early as <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 300. However, the first authenticated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is St. Theodore (d. 391), who was present at the Council of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> in 381. On the spot where the Abbey of Saint-Maurice now stands he built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Mauritius, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> here about 300. He also induced the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> of the vicinity to unite in a common life, thus beginning the Abbey of Saint-Maurice, the oldest north of the Alps. Theodore rebuilt the church at <a href="../cathen/14014c.htm">Sion</a>, which had been destroyed by <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Emperor Maximinianus</a> at the beginning of the fourth century. At first the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was a suffragan of Vienne; later it became suffragan of <a href="../cathen/14454a.htm">Tarentaise</a>. In 589 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, St. Heliodorus, transferred the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to <a href="../cathen/14014c.htm">Sion</a>, as Octodurum was frequently endangered by the inundations of the Rhone and the Drance. There were frequent disputes with the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the Abbey of Saint-Maurice, who were jealously watchful that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should not extend their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. Several of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> united both offices, as: Wilcharius (764-80), previously <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Vienne, from which he had been driven by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>; St. Alteus, who received from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of exemption in favour of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (780); Aimo II, son of Count Hubert of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, who entertained <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> at Saint-Maurice in 1049.

<p>The last king of Upper <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, Rudolph III, granted the Countship of Valais to Bishop Hugo (998- 1017); this union of the spiritual and <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular powers</a> made the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the most powerful ruler in the valley of the Upper Rhone. Taking this donation as a basis, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Sion extended their <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>, and the religious <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of the valley became also the political centre. However, the union of the two powers was the cause of violent disputes in the following centuries. For, while the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> extended over the whole valley of the Rhone above Lake Geneva, the Countship of Valais included only the upper part of the valley, reaching to the confluence of the Trient and the Rhone. The attempts of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Sion to carry their <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> farther down the Rhone were bitterly and successfully opposed by the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of Saint-Maurice, who had obtained large possessions in Lower Valais. The <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Sion belonged generally to noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> and Valais and were often drawn into the feuds of these <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. Moreover the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were vigorously opposed by the petty <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> nobles of Valais, who, trusting to their fortified castles on rocky heights, sought to evade the supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who was at the same time count and prefect of the Holy Roman Empire. Other opponents of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were the flourishing peasant communities of Upper Valais, which were called later the <em>sieben Zehnten</em> (seven-tenths). Their struggles with <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> forced the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to grant continually increasing political <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to the peasant communities. Thus Bishop William IV of Raron (1437-57) was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to relinquish civil and criminal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the <em>sieben Zehnten</em> by the Treaty of Naters in 1446, while a revolt of his subjects compelled Bishop Jost of Silinen (1482-96) to flee from the diocese. Walter II of Supersax (1457-82) took part in the battles of the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> against Charles the Bold of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> and his confederate, the Duke of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, and in 1475 drove the House of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> from Lower Valais. The most important <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of this era was Matthew Schinner (1499-1522), a highly cultivated Humanist. Bishop Schinner, fearing that French supremacy would endanger the freedom of the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a>, placed the military force of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> at the disposal of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and in 1510 brought about an alliance for five years between the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Confederacy and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. In return for this <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> made the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. In 1513 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had succeeded in having his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> separated from the Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/14454a.htm">Tarentaise</a> and placed directly under the control of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The defeat of the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> in 1515 at the battle of Marignano, at which Schinner himself fought, weakened his position in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and the arbitrary rule of his brothers led to a revolt of his subjects; in 1518 he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave the diocese.

<p>The new doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> found little acceptance in Valais, although preachers were sent into the canton from <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a>, <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a>, and Basle. In 1529 Bishop Adrian I of Riedmatten (1529-48), the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, and the <em>sieben Zehnten</em> formed an alliance with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cantons of the Confederation, the purpose of which was to maintain and protect the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> in all the territories of the allied cantons against the efforts of the Reformed cantons. On account of this alliance Valais aided in gaining the victory of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> over the followers of <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> at Cappel in 1531; this victory saved the possessions of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of Saint-Maurice opposed all religious innovations as energetically as did Bishops Adrian I of Riedmatten, Hildebrand of Riedmatten (1565-1604), and Adrian II of Riedmatten (1604-13), so that the whole of Valais remained <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Both Adrian II and his successor Hildebrand Jost (1613-38) were again involved in disputes with the <em>sieben Zehnten</em> in regard to the exercise of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of secular supremacy. In order to put an end to these quarrels and not to endanger the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> he relinquished in 1630 the greater part of his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> as secular suzerain, and the power of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was thereafter limited almost entirely to the spiritual sphere.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was brought to an end by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. In 1798 Valais, after an heroic struggle against the supremacy of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, was incorporated into the Helvetian Republic, and Bishop John Anthony Blatter (1790-1817) retired to <a href="../cathen/11134b.htm">Novara</a>. During the sway of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> Valais was separated from <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> in 1802 as the Rhodanic Republic, and in 1810 was united with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Most of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were suppressed. In 1814 Valais threw off French supremacy, when the Allies entered the territory; in 1815 it joined <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> as one of the cantons. As partial compensation for the loss of his <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> received a post of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in the Diet of the canton and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to four votes. Disputes often arose as the Constitution of 1815 of the canton gave Upper Valais political predominance in the cantonal government, notwithstanding the fact that its population was smaller than that of Lower Valais. This led in 1840 to a civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with Lower Valais, where the "Young <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a>" party, hostile to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, were in control. The party friendly to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> conquered, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and the influence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> over teaching was, at first, preserved, but on account of the defeat of the <em>Sonderband,</em> with which Valais had united, a radical Government gained control in 1847. The new administration at once showed itself unfriendly to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, secularized many church landed properties, and wrung large sums of money from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. When in 1856 the moderate party gained the cantonal election, negotiations were begun with Bishop Peter Joseph von Preux (1843-75), and friendly relations were restored between the diocese and the canton. In 1880 the two powers came to an agreement as to the lands taken from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in 1848; these, so far as they had not been sold, were given back for their original uses. Since then the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the Government have been on friendly terms. The new Constitution of 1907 declares the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion to be the religion of the canton, and forbids any union of spiritual and secular functions. The ordinances regulating the election of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> which have been in existence from early times, at least, contradict this (see below). The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Julius Mauritius Abbet, b. 12 Sept., 1845, appointed <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> <em>cum jure successionis</em> 1 Oct., 1895, succeeded to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> 26 Feb., 1901.
<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>The boundaries of the Diocese of Valais have hardly been changed since it was founded; the diocese includes the Upper Rhone Valley, that is, the Canton of Valais, with exception of the exempt Abbey of Saint-Maurice, and of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> inhabitants of Saint-Gingolph, who belong to the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/01540a.htm">Diocese of Annecy</a>; it also includes the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of Bex and Aigle that belong to the Canton of Vaud. In 1911 the diocese had 11 deaneries, 125 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 70 chaplaincies, 208 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 135 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and professed, about 120,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Nearly 30 per cent of the population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> speak German, and nearly 65 percent French; the language of the rest of the population is Italian. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is elected by the denominationally mixed Great Council from a list of four candidates presented by the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, and the election is laid before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for confirmation. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter consists of ten canons; in addition five rectors are included among the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are trained at a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at Sion that has six <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> professors and twelve resident students; there are also six <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students studying at the <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">University of Innsbruck</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of men in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a>, with houses on the Great St. Bernard, the Simplon, and at Martigny, containing altogether 45 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 6 professed and 7 lay-brothers; <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, at Sion and Saint-Maurice, numbering 22 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 6 students of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and 9 lay-brothers. The exempt abbey of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a> at Saint-Maurice contains 46 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 9 professed and lay- brothers. The orders and congregations of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: <a href="../cathen/02507a.htm">Bernardines</a> at Colombay; Hospital Sisters at <a href="../cathen/14014c.htm">Sion</a>; Sisters of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> at Saint-Maurice; <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Nuns, at the same place; Sisters of Charity of the Holy Cross at <a href="../cathen/14014c.htm">Sion</a>, Leuk, and Leukerbad; <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> Nuns at Sion and Brieg.
