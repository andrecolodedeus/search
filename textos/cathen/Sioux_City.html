<h1>Sioux City</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF SIOUX CITY (SIOPOLITAN).

<p>Erected 15 Jan., 1902, by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>. The establishment of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was provided for in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> appointing Most Rev. John J. Keane, D.D., to the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a> on 24 July, 1900. This provision was made on the occasion of that appointment for the reason that the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was taken entirely from <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Archdiocese of Dubuque</a>. It comprises twenty-four counties in north-western <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>, including a territory of 14,518 square miles. Sioux City is on the extreme limit of the western boundary of <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>, situated on the east bank of the Missouri River, about one hundred miles north of <a href="../cathen/11249b.htm">Omaha</a>. With the exception of Des Moines, the capital, it is the largest and most enterprising municipality in the <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">State of Iowa</a>, containing a population of between fifty and sixty thousand. It is in the midst of a large and rich agricultural country, and relies chiefly on the products of the soil, of which the staple article is corn; consequently grain-packing is the chief industry of Sioux City. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is almost sixty thousand. It has 138 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, including missions, 122 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, of whom 6 are religious (4 <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> and 2 Fathers of the Sacred Heart); 53 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with 4 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>; 4 academies; 2 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of domestic <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>; an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>, a Good Shepherd home, an <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">infant asylum</a>, a home for the aged, and a working girls' home. There are 7327 children in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and nearly 8000 under <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> care. The composition of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is English-speaking and German. These form the principal elements of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> membership here, and are almost equally divided in numbers. A characteristic feature of western <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> is manifest here as in other western <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, that is the ardent desire of the people for <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> wherever it is possible. Out of the 10,000 children of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> age (i.e. under seventeen years) in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, three-fourths are in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The following orders conduct <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> in the diocese: Sisters of Charity B.V.M., <a href="../cathen/03711a.htm">Sisters of Christian Charity</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Sisters of St. Dominic</a>, Sister of St. Francis (Dubuque, <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>), <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters (Clinton, <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>), <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters of Perpetual Adoration, School Sisters of St. Francis, Presentation Nuns, <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servants of Mary</a>, Sister of St. Benedict, <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, Sisters of the Good Shepherd.

<p>Since its establishment nine years ago, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is thoroughly organized and has been constantly expanding by the erection of churches, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and expanding by the erection of churches, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and other institutions. The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the Right Reverend Philip J. Garrigan, D.D., first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, was born in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in the early forties, came to this country with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and received his elementary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Lowell, Mass. He pursued his classical course at St. Charles's College, Ellicott City, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, and courses of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the Provincial Seminary of New York at Troy, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> on 11 June, 1870. After a short term as <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> of St. John's Church, <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, he was appointed director of the Troy <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for three years; and was for fourteen years afterwards <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Bernard's Church, Fitchburg, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>. In the fall of 1888 he was appointed first vice-rector of the Catholic University at Washington, D. C., which position he also held for fourteen years. He was named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sioux City on 21 March, 1902, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of his home diocese, <a href="../cathen/14236c.htm">Springfield</a>, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, on 25 May of the same year, by the Right Rev. T.D. Beaven, and on 18 June following took possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>.
