<h1>Sioux Falls</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF SIOUX FALLS (SIOUXORMENSIS).

<p>Suffragan of <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, comprises all that part of the <a href="../cathen/14160a.htm">State of South Dakota</a> east of the Missouri River, an area of 34,861 square miles. The western portion of the state, forming the present <a href="../cathen/09098a.htm">Diocese of Lead</a>, was detached from the Diocese of Sioux Falls, 8 August, 1902. The early history of religion in <a href="../cathen/14160a.htm">South Dakota</a> (until 1879) must be sought for in the histories respectively of St. Paul, <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, and Nebraska. The first Mass celebrated in <a href="../cathen/14160a.htm">South Dakota</a> was in 1842, in Brown County, by the late Monsignor Ravoux of St. Paul on his first visit to the <a href="../cathen/14017a.htm">Sioux Indians</a>; and the first church erected was in 1867, by the late Father Pierre Boucher, who was sent by Bishop Grace of St. Paul to Jefferson, Union County, to attend the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> scattered about that centre. In August, 1879, the Vicariate Apostolic of Dakota, whose boundaries corresponded with the ten existing civil boundaries of the newly formed Territory of Dakota, was established, and the Right Reverend Martin Marty, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Meinrad's <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, nominated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14716a.htm">Tiberias</a> and <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of the new district. Bishop Marty was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the Church of St. Ferdinand, Ferdinand, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, 1 February, 1880, by the Right Reverend Francis Silas Chatard, the present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07744a.htm">Indianapolis</a>. The vicariate was an immense district to govern (149,112 square miles) with scarcely any mode of travelling, except by the primitive ox or mule teams. A few miles of railroad existed from <a href="../cathen/14016a.htm">Sioux City</a> to Yankton. The new <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> went directly to Yankton, where he took up his residence. He found 12 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> administering to a scattered <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of less than 14,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and 20 churches. Many and heroic were the hardships endured by both <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. At the close of 1881 the number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> increased to 37, the number of churches to 43 with 35 stations. There were 3 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, 2 academies for young ladies, 4 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for the white and 4 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for the Indian children, while the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, including 700 Indians, numbered 15,800 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. The decade beginning with 1880, witnessed a wonderful development and the population increased from 135,180 to 250,000. The statistics at the end of 1883 show 45 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 82 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 67 stations, 4 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, 4 academies, 12 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 6 Indian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, including 1,600 Indians, of 25,600 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. The Territory of Dakota was divided by Act of Congress, 22 February, 1889, and the two states, <a href="../cathen/11111b.htm">North</a> and <a href="../cathen/14160a.htm">South Dakota</a>, were admitted to the Union, 2 November, 1889. The same month witnessed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> division of the vicariate, and two new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were formed, Sioux Falls (<a href="../cathen/14160a.htm">South Dakota</a>) with Bishop Marty its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; and Jamestown (<a href="../cathen/11111b.htm">North Dakota</a>), now Fargo, with Bishop Shanley (d. July, 1909) its first incumbent. In 1894 Bishop Marty was transferred to the Diocese of St. Cloud, <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>, where he died 19 September, 1896.

<p>The efforts of Bishop Marty were <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with marvellous success. He devoted himself especially to the Indian race. He spoke their language and translated <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> into their tongue. The second and present (1911) <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sioux Falls, the Right Rev. Thomas O'Gorman, was born at <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston, Massachusetts</a>, 1 May, 1843, he moved with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to St. Paul, and was one of the first two students selected for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> by Bishop Cretin, the other was Archbishop Ireland. Having pursued his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, he returned to St. Paul, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 5 November, 1865. He was <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> in turn of Rochester and Faribault, Minn., and first president and professor of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> at St. Thomas' College, St. Paul. In 1890 he was appointed Professor of Church History in the Catholic University, Washington, D. C., was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in St. Patrick's Church, Washington, D. C. (19 April, 1896) by <a href="../cathen/13486a.htm">Cardinal Satolli</a>, then <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a> to this country, and on 1 May, 1896, was installed in the pro-cathedral of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. The statistics of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> then showed 51 secular and 14 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 50 churches with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 61 missions with churches, 100 stations, 10 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 14 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 61 Indian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 2 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, and l <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. There were 3 communities of men and 6 of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, white and Indian, was estimated at 30,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Bishop O'Gorman infused new life into the diocese. The population increased so rapidly that in 1902 the <a href="../cathen/09098a.htm">Diocese of Lead</a> was erected. The statistics of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (1911) are in <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, secular 102, regular 13; students 10; churches with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 91; missions with churches, 70; stations, 23; <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 13; <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 23 with 2,500 children in attendance; <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 4. There are 3 communities of men: <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/05596b.htm">Eudists</a>, and the Clerics of St. Viateur. The communities of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are: <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Sisters; Presentation Sisters; <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Sisters; Sisters of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis; School Sisters of St. Francis, and the Sisters of Charity of St. Louis. Columbus College at Chamberlain, in charge of the Clerics of St. Viateur is an institution of great promise. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, including 500 Indians, is 50,000. In the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> of thirty-one years ago, where there were only 1 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and 12 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, there are now (1911) 4 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and 284 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.
