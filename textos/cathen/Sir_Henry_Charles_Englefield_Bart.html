<h1>Sir Henry Charles Englefield, Bart.</h1>  

<p>Antiquary and scientist, b. 1752; d. 21 March, 1822. He was the eldest son of Sir Henry Englefield, sixth baronet, by his second wife, Catherine, daughter of Sir Charles Bucke, Bart. His father, who was the son of Henry Englefield, of White Knights near Reading, had in 1728 succeeded to the title and the Engelfield estates at Wooton Basset, Wilts; so that Henry Charles inherited both White Knights and Wooton Basset on the death of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, 25 May, 1780. He was never married and devoted his entire life to study. In 1778 at the early age of twenty-six he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in the following year Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. For many years he was vice-president of the latter, and succeeded the Marquess Townshend as president. Owing, however, to his being a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, objection was taken to his re-election, and he was replaced by the Earl of Aberdeen. Under his direction the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> produced between 1797 and 1813 the series of engravings of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>, to which series he contributed the dissertations on Durham, Gloucester, and <a href="../cathen/05708a.htm">Exeter</a>. In 1781 Englefield joined the Dilettanti Society and acted as its secretary for fourteen years. Besides his antiquarian studies, which resulted in many contributions to "Archaeologia", he carried on research in chemistry, mathematics, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, and geology. His "Discovery of a Lake from Madder" won for him the gold medal of the Society of Arts. He took no part in public life, owing to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> disabilities, but was intimate with Charles James Fox, and his cheerful temperament and vivacious conversation won him many friends. His portrait was <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> by Sir Thomas Lawrence, and two bronze medals were struck bearing his likeness.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> affairs Englefield took a prominent part, being elected in 1782 a member of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Committee, formed by the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> for the promotion of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests, a body which subsequently found itself in conflict with the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>. In the early stages of this dispute he was one of the moving spirits and contributed the pamphlet, mentioned below, in answer to Dr. Horsley, the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>. The latter afterwards became the friend of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and it was through his influence that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Relief Bill of 1791 was modified to suit the requirements of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Throughout the dispute Englefield took an independent line, and at times went rather far in his opposition to the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, as in 1792, when he was prepared to move a strong resolution at the general meeting of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. He was dissuaded at the last moment by the three who undertook to act as "Gentlemen Mediators" between the two parties. During his latter years his eyesight failed; he died at his house, Tilney St., London, the baronetcy thereupon becoming extinct. His works are: "tables of the Apparent Places of the Comet of 1661" (London, 1788); "Letter to the Author of 'The Review of the Case of the Protestant Dissenters'" (London, 1790); "On the Determination of the Orbits of Comets" (London, 1793); "A Walk Through Southampton" (Southampton, 1801); "Description of a New Transit Instrument, Improved by Sir H. Englefield" (London, 1814); "The Andrian, a Verse Translation from Terrence" (London, 1814); Description of the Principal Beauties, Antiquities and Geological Phenomena of the Isle of Wight", with engravings from his own drawings, and a portrait (London, 1816); "Observations on the Probable Consequences of the Demolition of London Bridge" (London, 1821). Gillow has printed (op. cit. inf.) a list of papers contributed to the transactions of the Society of Antiquaries, Royal Society, Royal Institution, Society of Arts, and the Linnaean Society, as well as to "Nicholson's Journal" and "Tillock's Philosophical Magazine".
