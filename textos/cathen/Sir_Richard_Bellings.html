<h1>Sir Richard Bellings</h1>  

<p>(Or Belling)

<p><a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> historian, b. near Dublin early in the seventeenth century; d. in 1677. He was the son of Sir Henry Bellings, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> landowner in Leinster. He was trained to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and entered Lincoln's Inn, London, and while there wrote a supplementary book (the sixth) to Sir Philip Sydney's "Arcadia", which has been generally printed with that work. He returned to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, became a member of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Parliament, and married a daughter of Viscount Mountgarret. In 1642, when the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Confederation was formed, Bellings joined, his father-in-law being president, and became secretary to the Supreme Council. He was sent to the continent in 1644 as a representative of this body. In the following year he returned to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and was active as a royalist till 1649, when he withdrew to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, most of his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> having been confiscated by the Cromwellians. His estate was restored to him after the accession of Charles II, who, with Ormonde, held him in high regard. He died in 1677 and was buried near Dublin. Perhaps his chief work is his defence of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, "Vindiciarum Catholicorum Hiberniae libri duo", which, under the pseudonym of "Philopater Irenaeus", was published at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1650. During his later years he also wrote an account of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> affairs (1641-48), an imperfect copy of which was printed in 1772. The complete work was, however, recovered, and was published under the editorship of John T. Gilbert, with the following title: "History of the Irish Confederation and the War in Ireland, 1641-48". This edition (Dublin, 1882-85) is enriched with many valuable documents and many illustrative notes, and was published form the original <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> The above-mentioned "Vindication" is regarded as one of the most trustworthy of the many works written on that period. However, the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, <a href="../cathen/12227b.htm">Father John Ponce</a>, controverted many of its statements in his "Richardi Bellingi Vindiciae Eversae" (Paris, 1653). A "Letter from Richard Bellings to M. Callaghan" on <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> affairs (Paris, c. 1652) is to be found in a French translation of the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> in the Gilbert Library, Dublin.
