<h1>Sir Richard Bulstrode</h1>  

<p>A soldier, diplomatist, and author, born 1610; died 1711, was the second son of Edward Bulstrode by Margaret, daughter of Richard Ashtey, chamberlain of the queen's household and member of the Inner Temple. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/11611a.htm">Pembroke</a> College, Cambridge, and while at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was the author of a poem on the birth of the Duke of York. At twenty-three years of age he entered the Inner Temple and in 1649, at his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> request and through his interest, was made a bencher. During the Civil War he was loyal to the king, serving in the Prince of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales's</a> regiment and holding at times the post of adjutant. He was later promoted to the rank of Adjutant-General of Horse, and still later to be Quartermaster-General. He was appointed to take charge of the funeral of Lord Strafford and became responsible for the expenses attending it; on being pressed by his creditors he fled to <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>. He subsequently underwent a short term of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, which was terminated by the payment of the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> by Charles II. On his return he was appointed auditor of a Scotch regiment then serving in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> and in 1673 was appointed agent at the court of <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>. He was temporarily recalled two years later, and on 1675 was knighted and again sent to <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, this time as resident, where he remained until the accession of James II when he was made envoy. When the <a href="../cathen/13007b.htm">revolution of 1688</a> compelled James to leave <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, Bulstrode accompanied him to the court of Saint-Germain, where he remained until his death. Among his writings are: "Original Letters written to Earl of Arlinton, with an account of the Author's Life and Family", "Life of James II", "Memoirs and Reflections on the Reign and Government of Charles I and Charles II" and a large number of elegies and epigrams.
