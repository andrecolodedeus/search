<h1>Sir Thomas Metham</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a>, <a href="../cathen/04215a.htm">confessor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>; died in York Castle, 1573. He was eldest son of Thomas Metham, of Metham, Yorkshire, and Grace, daughter of Thomas Pudsey, of Barford, and was twice married; first, to Dorothy, daughter of George, Lord Darcy and Meinill, and then to Edith, daughter of Nicholas Palmes of Naburn. He was dubbed a <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a> of the carpet, 2 Oct., 1553, the day after <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary's</a> <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a>. Through his second son by his first wife, George, he was grandfather of Father Thomas Metham, S.J., one of the <em>Dilati</em>. By 16 August, 1565, he and his second wife had been sent to gaol "for contempt of Her Majesty's ordinances concerning the administration of divine service and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>". On 6 Feb. 1569-70 an unknown correspondent writes to Sir William Cecil from York &mdash; "We have here Sir Thomas Metham, a most wilful papist, who utterly refuses to come to service, receive the Communion or read any books except approved by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, or to be conferred with at all. He refuses to be tried before the Commissioners for causes <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>; he uses the corrupt Louvaine books, and maintains at Louvaine two of his sons, with whom he corresponds. It is four years since he and Dame Edith, his wife, were first committed to ward, since which he has daily grown more <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a>, and wilful, and now seems utterly incorrigible. He does much hurt here, and is reverenced by the papists as a pillar of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. I caused him to be committed to the Castle, where he remains and does harm, yet would have done more if he had lived at large. If you would be a means of his removal, you would take away a great occasion of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in these parts." In 1587 Lady Metham was still a <a href="../cathen/12677a.htm">recusant</a>.
