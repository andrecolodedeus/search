<h1>Sir Tobie Matthew</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>, 3 October, 1577, died at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, 13 October, 1655. He was the son of Dr. Tobie Matthew, then Dean of Christ Church, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, and finally <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, and Frances, daughter of William Barlow, <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03657a.htm">Chichester</a>. Tobie Matthew matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, 13 March, 1589-90, and became M.A. 5 July, 1597. He seems to have been harshly treated by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, who were angered at his youthful extravagance. On 15 May, 1599, he was admitted at Gray's Inn, where he began his close intimacy with <a href="../cathen/02192a.htm">Sir Francis Bacon</a>, and two years later became M.P. for Newport, Cornwall. During this period of his life he frequented the dissolute court of Elizabeth. On the accession of James I he sat in Parliament for <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban's</a>, and joined the new court, receiving a large grant from the Crown which amply provided for his future. Having always desired to travel, he left <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in November, 1604, visiting <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> on his way to <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, though he had promised his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> he would not go to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. At Florence he came into the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of several <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and ended by being received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. A new <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was raging in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but he determined to return. He was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the Fleet for six months, and every effort was made to shake his resolution. Finally he was allowed to leave <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and he travelled in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In 1614 he studied for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by Cardinal <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> (20 May). The king allowed him to return to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1617, and he stayed for a time with <a href="../cathen/02192a.htm">Bacon</a> whose essays he translated into Italian. From 1619 to 1622 he was again exiled, but on his return was favourably received by the king, and acted as an agent at court to promote the marriage of Prince Charles with the Spanish Infanta. In the same cause James sent him to <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> and on his return knighted him, 20 Oct., 1623. During the reign of Charles I he remained in high favour at court where he laboured indefatigably for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause. When the Civil War broke out in 1640 he, now an old man, took refuge with the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at their house at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, where he died. He was always an ardent supporter of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. and. though it has long been denied that he was ever himself a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, papers recently discovered at Oulton Abbey show strong reason for supposing that he was in fact a member of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. Besides the Italian version of <a href="../cathen/02192a.htm">Bacon's</a> "Essays", he translated St. Augustine's "Confessions" (1620), the Life of St. Teresa written by herself (1623), and Father Arias's "Treatise of Patience" (1650). His original works were: "A Relation of the death of Troilo Severe, Baron of Rome" (1620); "A Missive of Consolation sent from Flanders to the Catholics of England" (1647): "A True Historical Relation of the Conversion of Sir Tobie Matthew to the Holie Catholic Faith" (first published in 1904), some <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> works (see Gillow, "Bibl. Dict. Eng. Cath.", IV, 541-42). His letters were edited by Dr. John Donne in 1660.
