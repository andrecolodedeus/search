<h1>Sisters Marianites of Holy Cross</h1>  

<p>The congregation of the Sisters Marianites of Holy Cross was founded in 1841, in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Holy Cross near <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a>, Sarthe, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the same city, Basile-Antoine Moreau, b. at Laign&eacute;-en-Belin, Sarthe, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 11 February 1799; d. at <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a>, 20 January, 1873. He was aided in this work by L&eacute;ocadie Gascoin, who was born at Montenay, Mayenne, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 1 March, 1818; and died at <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a>, 29 January, 1900. The Rev. B. A. Moreau sent her with three other young ladies to the superioress of the Good Shepherd house in <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a> to prepare for the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. After a year's instruction he had them assist in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational establishment</a> founded at Holy Cross, and permitted them to engage themselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the triple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of poverty, chastity, and obedience, pronounced August 4, 1841. Thus was formed the nucleus of a religious <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of which Miss Gascoin became the first superior, under the name of Sister Mary of Seven Dolours, in honor of the august patroness of the congregation, 15 September, 1844. Mgr. Formari, <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, being informed of the projects of Rev. B. A. Moreau, approved them. The congregation, of which the rules were approved for ten years on trial, 19 February, 1867, by the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a>, received its final <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> on 28 October, 1885. It comprises two provinces: that of <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, numbering 13 houses, and that of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 10 houses; the missions of New York are attached to the French Province. There are two novitiates, one in <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, and the other in Tottenville, Staten Island. This congregation, the members of which take only simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, is governed by a general superioress and six councillors, elected every six years by the general chapter. The mother house is in <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The founder in grouping these <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of goodwill listened to their desire to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> themselves to the care of the sick, the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth, and the charge of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>. Mgr. De la Hailandi&egrave;re, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vincennes, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a> begged Rev. B. A. Moreau to send him Sisters. This request was granted, and the mission known as Notre Dame du Lac was founded in 1843. Mgr. Bourget, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, in 1846 asked B.A. Moreau, whom he had visited at Holy Cross, to send him Sisters whom he might establish in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Four religious were sent in 1847 and founded their first house in the village of <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>, near <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. These two foundations, with their numerous affiliations, declared themselves independent: <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a> in 1867, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> in 1883. The third foundation was established in <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> in 1851. In the same year, by direction of the cardinal prefect the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, a foundation was made at <a href="../cathen/04601b.htm">Dacca</a>, Bengal, <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>; owing to the climate, however, this mission was abandoned. In 1861 the Sisters opened in New York City an establishment, now known as the Asylum of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, where 221 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> are cared for. At present (1909) in the same city the Sisters are in charge of an academy, a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, a day nursery; they serve in the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, and have also the care of an academy at Tottenville, Staten Island.
