<h1>Sisters of Charity of Nazareth</h1>  

<p>Founded Dec., 1812, by the Rev. B.J.M. David (see <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">D<font size=-2>IOCESE OF</font> L<font size=-2>OUISVILLE</font></a>). Father David, while establishing his <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> on the farm of St. Thomas, near Bardstown, Nelson County, <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, took charge of the missions among the surrounding <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population. Here he found children without instructors, sick, aged, and poor without care. The need of devoted religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> was felt. He found a few young girls willing to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> their lives to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and their neighbour. The first to offer herself was Teresa Carrico; Catherine Spalding, her assistant, Harriet Gardiner, and others followed. Very soon six were assembled, and the number continued to increase. All were daughters of pioneer settlers (see <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">K<font size=-2>ENTUCKY</font></a>, <em>Religion</em>); their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and capacity for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> formed their only dower. They taught the children, spun wool or flax, and wove it into cloth out of which they fashioned garments for themselves and for Father David's seminarians, who, on the side, found time in the intervals of study to fell trees, hew logs, and build the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. The first log house occupied by the sisters received from Father David the name of <em>Nazareth</em>. This name the mother-house has preserved, and thence the sisters are popularly called "Sisters of Nazareth", being thus distinguished from other Sisters of Charity.

<p>Mother Seton could not spare sisters from Emmisttsburg to train the new community, as Bishop Flaget had requested, but she sent him the same copy of the Rule of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> which he himself had brought her from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and Father David carefully attended to the training of the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>. In February, 1816, he found the first sisters sufficiently prepared to take the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. The little body was fairly organized, and its work was fast extending. Miss Eleanor O'Connell (Sister Ellen), a scholarly <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and experienced teacher, came to them from <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and to her the early success of the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work of Nazareth is largely due. The reputation of Nazareth Academy was soon established, and students, even from a distance, crowded the classrooms, although it was not until 1829 that the Legislature of Kentucky granted its charter to the "Nazareth Literary and Benevolent Institution". Sister Ellen prepared others to assist her, establishing what was virtually a normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the sisters, which has been <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> maintained ever since. In 1822 the mother-house was removed to a farm purchased for the purpose near Bardstown. Both the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> church and the academy building were completed in 1825. The sisters, at the same time, never lost sight of their primary work of succouring the sick and the poor. In each of their houses destitute children were cared for. St. Vincent's Orphan Asylum was opened in <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, after the cholera epidemic, in 1834. Thenceforth <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and asylums grew apace.

<p>Besides the mother-house, the congregation now has sixteen branch academies and high schools modelled upon it. The sisters teach about 15,000 children in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and care for more than 5000 sick in their <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and infirmaries. On petition of the present superior, Mother Eutropia McMahon, the congregation received the formal <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, 5 September, 1910, nearly 98 years after its first foundation.
