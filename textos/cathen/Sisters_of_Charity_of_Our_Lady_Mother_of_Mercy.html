<h1>Sisters of Charity of Our Lady Mother of Mercy</h1>  

<p>A congregation founded in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> in 1832 by the Rev. John Zwijsen, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Tilburg, aided by Mary M. Leijsen, for the instruction of children and the betterment of a people deprived of spiritual aid by the disastrous effects of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The See of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a> had been vacant for about three hundred years when, on the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> in 1853, Bishop John Zwijsen, of Gerra, was made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a> and <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. He found no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutions for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of girls in this vast diocese, neither were there any teaching orders, with the exception of his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> congregation. The founder's accession to the See gave fresh impetus to his cherished work, and from this time the congregation spread rapidly throughout <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. There is now hardly a city of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> that has not one or more of its communities. Among these institutions are homes for the aged and infirm, the blind, the mutes and also <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. The Rules were approved by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> in 1843, and <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> approved the congregation in 1848. About the middle of the eighteenth century, when the cholera was raging in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, the heroic charity of the sisters won the recognition of King William III who conferred decorations of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> on the congregation. It has three houses in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> devoted to <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> work. In 1874 the first house in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was founded at Baltic, <a href="../cathen/04253b.htm">Connecticut</a>, where there is a Parochial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and an academy for young ladies. The congregation has other houses at Willimantic and Taftville where the same work is carried on. In 1907 St. Joseph's community of Willimantic donated, one of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> buildings for a city <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, which from the outset <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a success. In 1894 the congregation took charge of the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> settlement, city and military <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> of Paramaribo, South America; and in East <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, the sisters are doing missionary work among the natives. In December, 1907, this congregation had 2621 professed members, 488 aspirants and <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> and 102 houses. The number of school children enrolled was estimated at 54,300; the sick, aged and infirm cared for 3446.
