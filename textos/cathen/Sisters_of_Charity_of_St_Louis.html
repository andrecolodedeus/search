<h1>Sisters of Charity of St. Louis</h1>  

<p>This congregation was founded at <a href="../cathen/15271b.htm">Vannes</a> in Brittany, in 1803, by Madame Mol&eacute;, <em>n&eacute;e</em> de Lamoignan, for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> girls, at the suggestion of Bishop de Pancemont, of <a href="../cathen/15271b.htm">Vannes</a>, who was her director. In 1805 <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> blessed the undertaking, but the final <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was not obtained till 1840. The founder was elected superior for life as M&egrave;re St. Louis. There were at first no <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay</a> sisters, but finding this plan did not answer, Oblates of St. Louis were selected to act in this capacity, but they are not allowed to take <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> until they have been ten years in the community; they then, like the choir-sisters, take a fourth <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of stability, when they have reached the age of forty. The interior spirit of the congregation is one of penitence and <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>. Its work is the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of poor girls who live in <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> attached to their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and to support these <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> the sisters have pay <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The congregation is under the government of a mother-general and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or a superior appointed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The sisters had twenty houses in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, most of which were in Brittany, but all their <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were closed by the Government; the greater number of the sisters in consequence went to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, where they met with a hospitable reception, and established fourteen houses. In 1898 they went to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and opened a house at Minehead in Dorsetshire; they have since made a foundation at <a href="../cathen/06579a.htm">Glastonbury</a> and another at Frome. The <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> lasts two years.
