<h1>Sisters of Charity of St. Paul</h1>  

<p>These sisters who now add "<font size=-2>OF</font> C<font size=-2>HARTRES</font>" to their title to distinguish them from another congregation of the same name, were founded at <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a> in 1704 by Monsignor Mar&eacute;chaut, a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, assisted by Mlle de Tilly and Mlle de Tronche. Their first house formerly belonged to a sabot-maker, and this gave them the name of "Les Soeurs Sabotiers", by which they were originally known. They devote themselves to teaching, nursing, visiting the poor and taking care of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, the old and infirm, and the insane. There are no lay-sisters, but every sister must be prepared to undertake any kind of work. The interior spirit is a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of sacrifice and labor for the spiritual and temporal good of others. The postulancy lasts from six to nine months, the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> a year, after which the sisters take <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> annually for three years, and then perpetual simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. The congregation was dispersed under the Commune at the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, but it was restored by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a>, who gave the sisters a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, which originally belonged to the Jacobins, from which they became known as "Les Soeurs de St. Jacques". They settled in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1847 at the invitation of <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a>. In 1907 they had fifty-six houses in various towns. Their work in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> is mainly <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a>, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> being attached to all their houses; the English branch is under the government of a mother general. Until 1902 they had over two hundred and fifty houses in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> where, besides various kinds of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, they undertook asylums for the blind, the aged, and the insane, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, dispensaries, and cr&egrave;ches. Since that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> more than one hundred and sixty of these <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> have been closed, also thirty of the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, military and civil, in the French colonies, three <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> at <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a> and a hospice at Brie. On the other hand they have in the meanwhile opened five or six <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> in the French colonies, two <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and three elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, and three <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> houses in Siam.
