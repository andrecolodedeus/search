<h1>Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word</h1>  

<p>This congregation, with simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, was founded by Rt. Rev. C.M. Dubuis, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06372a.htm">Galveston</a>. In 1866, this <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> travelled as far as <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in search of religious, who would devote themselves to works of mercy in his large diocese. He addressed himself to Mother Angelique, Superioress of the Convent of the Incarnate Word, at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, and requested her to train some worthy subjects for the missions of <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>. Mother Angelique complied with his demand, received into her community two or three <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a>, and prepared them in a special manner for their future work; thus was formed the nucleus of the new congregation, which was to be known as the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word. The three sisters embarked for <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a> soon after, and landed at <a href="../cathen/06372a.htm">Galveston</a> in December, 1866. Arrived at their mission, they devoted themselves to the care of the sick. In 1867 and 1868 other bands of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> sisters, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> and professed in the same <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, came to their assistance; their arrival opened for the congregation a new era: the existing works were perfected, and others established. On 31 March, 1869, Bishop C.M. Dubuis sent from <a href="../cathen/06372a.htm">Galveston</a> a colony of these sisters to found a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/13424b.htm">San Antonio</a>; in 1870, he erected this new community into an independent centre, on the occasion of vesting the first <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a> admitted into the San Antonio <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. Previous to 1874, the sisters had been solely occupied in caring for the sick, the aged, and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, but following the counsel of Rt. Rev. A.D. Pellicer, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13424b.htm">San Antonio</a>, they then engaged in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work. The community of <a href="../cathen/13424b.htm">San Antonio</a>, with its dependent houses, was organized into a generalate in August, 1897, with the sanction of Bishop John A. Forest.

<p>At present, the congregation is governed by a superioress general and her council composed of six members. The mother-house, <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, and normal department are situated in <a href="../cathen/13424b.htm">San Antonio</a>, <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>. The probation as <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulant</a> and <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> lasts two years. Perpetual profession is preceded by give years of annual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. The constitutions, based upon the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>, were approved by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in 1905. The congregation, as its name indicates, is especially <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the Incarnate Word. The sisters foster the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and constant <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> to learn and to teach how to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and serve more and more <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made Man; they endeavour to reproduce in their daily conduct His two favourite virtues, charity and obedience. The sisters also cultivate a particular devotion to the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> and to Mary Immaculate. The congregation has developed considerably during the past forty years. From a small colony of three sisters in 1869, it has grown to a flourishing community of five hundred and forty-two members, and has under its direction five colleges, thirteen academies, twenty-eight <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, four <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, nine <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and two homes for the aged. These establishments are distributed throughout the States of <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, and Oklahoma, and the <a href="../cathen/10250b.htm">Republic of Mexico</a>.
