<h1>Sisters of Divine Providence</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Sisters of the Divine Providence of St. Vincent de Paul</h2>

<p>Founded at Molsheim, in <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Diocese of Strasburg</a>, by Vicar Ludwig Kremp (1783). After the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> the community reassembled at Bindernheim and, in 1807, received both <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and civil <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>, the former from <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, the latter from <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a>. In 1819, the mother-house was definitely located at Rappoltsweiler, and in 1869 the institute received <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation. The congregation has (1908) 1800 members, over 1200 of them teachers in 357 primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Alsace. The sisters have over 44,000 children under instruction; they conduct boarding and day <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>, reformatories, a housekeeping <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, a high school for girls, and a deaf and dumb institution. Attached to the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> are a teacher's <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and practice <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>.
<h2 id="section2">The Society of Divine Providence</h2>

<p>Founded, in 1842, at St. Mauritz near M&uuml;nster by <a href="../cathen/10279b.htm">Eduard Michelis</a>, <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> and private secretary to <a href="../cathen/05161b.htm">Archbishop Droste zu Vischering</a> of Cologne. He shared the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of his <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> and on his return went to St. Mauritz, where, with the help of two other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, he founded an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>. He selected several teachers whom he sent to the Sisters of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> at Rappoltsweiler to be trained in the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. The rule followed there was adopted with a few alterations by the new community and received episcopal <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>. The congregation took as its special work the care of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, neglected, and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphaned</a> children, as well as teaching in general. In 1878 the work of the sisters was interrupted by the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em>, and they were forced to take refuge at Steyl, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. In 1887, when they resumed their work in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the mother-house was removed to Friedrichsburg near <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, where a boarding and a trade <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> were opened. In the city of M&uuml;nster the sisters have charge of the domestic management of five episcopal institution, and in the city and diocese they conduct boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>, protectories, trade <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, Sunday <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, a working <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women's</a> home (Rheine) and a Magdelan asylum (at Marienburg). In Bremen they direct an elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, Sunday <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>. The congregation has 50 branch houses in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and 14 in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, among the latter the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Joseph at Steyl, that of Maria-Roepaan at Ottersum, and of St. Aloysius at Kessel. In 1895 a colony of sisters went to <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, where they now have six institutions. The congregation numbers (1908) 1115 members.
<h2 id="section3">Sisters of Divine Providence</h2>

<p>Founded at Finthen near <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> (whence they are sometimes called the Finthen Sisters) in 1851 by <a href="../cathen/08629c.htm">Bishop Wilhelm Emmanuel Freiherr von Ketteler</a>. The first superior was sent to the Sisters of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> at Ribeauvillee, Alsace, to be formed in the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, and the rule followed there was made the basis of the new institute, which later received the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>. The congregation was founded primarily for the work of teaching and for the care of the sick so far as consonant with their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as teachers. The right of corporation was not obtained until 1858, but as early as 1856 the Finthen Sisters had charge of the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> of Neustadt. At the time of the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> they had 21 foundations in the Grand Duchy of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>. When they were allowed to resume their activities they devoted themselves less to purely <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work and took charge of <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, children's asylums, homes for girls, industrial and housekeeping <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>, servant's homes, endowed infirmaries, and almshouses. Connected with the mother-house at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> are 76 branch houses with 730 members, 70 in the <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Diocese of Mainz</a>, and 6 in that of <a href="../cathen/09260a.htm">Limburg</a>. In <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> the sisters conduct a boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> with housekeeping and trade courses. At Oberursel they direct the <em>Johannesstift</em> for abandoned children founded by <a href="../cathen/08284c.htm">Joannes Janssen</a>. Wherever these sisters have houses they care for the sick in their homes.
<h2 id="section4">Sisters of Divine Providence</h2>

<p>Mother-house at <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburgh</a>, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> founded in 1876 by six sisters from <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> (see III), who were later joined by other sisters from <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. The congregation now numbers about 200, in charge of 20 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Diocese of Pittsburgh</a>, one in <a href="../cathen/15608a.htm">Wheeling</a> and 2 in the <a href="../cathen/04149a.htm">Columbus Diocese</a>.
<h2 id="section5">Congregation of the Sisters of Divine Providence</h2>

<p>Founded in <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, 1762, by the <a href="../cathen/10609a.htm">Venerable Jean-Martin Moye</a> (b. 1730; d, 1793), <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Diocese of Metz</a>, afterwards missionary to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, for "the propagation of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the ensuring of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> to children, especially those of the rural population, for the care of the sick, and other works of mercy". Approved by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> in 1762, and recommended by the solicitude of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, within six years the congregation had exceeded the limits of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and planted itself on the banks of the Vosges. Marie Morel was the first superior. Suppreseed in 1792, the congregation was re-established after the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>; in 1816 the Rules and Constitution were formally approved by Louis XVIII. The mother-house general is at St.-Jean-de-Bassel, in the <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Diocese of Metz</a>, <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, with establishments in <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, Alsace, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. There are about 500 sisters in the <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Diocese of Metz</a>, and 300 in the <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Diocese of Strasburg</a>, who direct <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, domestic economy institutes, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, etc. At St-Jean-de-Bassel there is a normal institute devoted exclusively to the training of the young teachers of the congregation, generally 185 in number, and connected with this institute is a model <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, all under the supervision of the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> boards of the German Imperial Government. In <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> there are about 100 sisters. At Pecq, near <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, they direct a normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and a boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Elsewhere they have charge of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and kindergartens.
<h3>Sisters of Divine Providence</h3>

<p>Of Kentucky; incorporated American provincial house at Mt. St. Martin's <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, Newport, Kentucky. Mother Anna Houlne, superior general (d. 1903) of the congregation succeeded in placing the Sisters of St-Jean-de-Bassel in the foremost ranks of teachers in Alsace-Lorraine, and then, Moye, long to see them labour for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth in America, where she rightly judged the labourers to be few. In 1888 Bishop Maes of <a href="../cathen/04462b.htm">Covington</a>, <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, visited the mother-house general at St-Jean-de-Bassel, and arranged to have the sisters introduced into his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Accordingly, in August, 1889, three sisters arrived in <a href="../cathen/04462b.htm">Covington</a> and took up residence in one of the historical mansions of northern Kentucky, now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> as Mt. St. Martin's <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. The growth of the American branch has necessitated the building of a new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. In October, 1908, a considerable estate was acquired at <a href="../cathen/10155a.htm">Melbourne</a>, <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, the site of a new St. Ann's Convent, where it is designed to erect the new provincial house. Mother Anna visited the American Province in 1892. There are 215 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; until 1903 occasional small colonies were added from the mother-house general; about one third of the subjects are American. At Mt. St. Martin's <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> are the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the province. Teaching is primary object of the sisters. They conduct an academy and many <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, an <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">infant asylum</a>, a home for French emigrant and working girls, and a home for the aged. The sisters are working in the <a href="../cathen/04462b.htm">Diocese of Covington</a>, <a href="../cathen/12509a.htm">Providence</a>, and Cleveland, and the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdioceses</a> of New York, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>.
<h2 id="section6">Sisters of Divine Providence</h2>

<p>Founded at Castroville, <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> 1868, by Sister St. Andrew from the mother-house at St-Jean-de-Bassel, <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, at the instance of Bishop Dubuis of <a href="../cathen/06372a.htm">Galveston</a>. In 1896 the mother-house was transferred to San Antonio. The Constitutions were approved by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Pope Leo X</a>, 28 May, 1907 (?) The sisters have charge (1908) of 67 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and academies in <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>, <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, and Oklahoma.
<h2 id="section7">Sisters of Divine Providence of St. Andrew</h2>

<p>Founded at Hambourg-la-Forteresse, in 1806, by Father Anton Gapp, "for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> instruction of children in the primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and higher <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls". The congregation received the authorization of the French Government in 1826, and the mother-house was established at Forbach, <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, but in 1839 was removed to Peltre. Destroyed in 1870 by the flames which swept the whole district, it was rebuilt after the close of the Franco-Prussian War. The congregation has now in Lorraine 138 institutions, among them 7 higher <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls, 20 trade and several housekeeping <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and 9 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. In <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> they have 35 foundations. There are altogether 900 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, who teach 17,000 children in <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a> and 4000 in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>.
