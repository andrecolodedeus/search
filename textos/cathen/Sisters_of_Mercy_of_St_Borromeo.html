<h1>Sisters of Mercy of St. Borromeo</h1>  

<p>Originally a pious association of ladies formed in 1626 for the care of the sick in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of St. Charles at <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a>, but constituted a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community in 1652 after being generously endowed by the father of Emmanuel Chauvenel, a young advocate who had given his life in the service of the sick. The members placed themselves under the patronage of <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>, the Apostle of Charity, and adapted the rules and constitutions drawn up by P&egrave;re Epiphane Louys, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Estival and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the Reformed <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>. By the middle of the eighteenth century the congregation was in charge of numerous <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and shortly afterwards took up as an additional task the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of children. During the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolutionary</a> period the members, although dispersed and deprived of their garb, continued their work so heroically as to win the encomiums of their <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a>. On 22 July, 1804, they reassumed their religious habit, obtained the approval of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, and were soon in a flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>. Their rule, based on that of St. Augustine, received <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> in 1859, and additional constitutions were confirmed by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in 1892. Their work includes the direction of all manner of <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>, such as domestic and trade <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, homes for first communicants, protectories, poor-houses, homes for defectives, and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> reformatories, as well as the care of the sick in their homes. They also have charge of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, including a number of normal institutes in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Candidates must spend one year as <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a> and from three to four and a half years as <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> before being admitted to the congregation. The auxiliary sisters for the care of the sick renew their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> annually.

<p>There are several entirely independent branches of Borromean Sisters. In 1838 one was established by Aloysius Joseph Freiherr von Schrenk, Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a> (died 1849), which was confirmed as a separate congregation in 1841, and now numbers 900 members in 102 houses, chiefly in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a>, and Upper and Lower <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. In 1848 <a href="../cathen/04786b.htm">Melchior Freiherr von Diepenbrock</a>, Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, invited the Prague Borromeans to found a house at Neisse, which, in 1857, was raised to the rank of the mother-house of a separate congregation. Later the mother-house was transferred to Trebnitz, and temporarily, during the <a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a>, to Teschen, where a provincial house for <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> was later established (1889). A house of this congregation founded at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> in 1884 was, in 1894, made a provincial mother-house and a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> for the Orient, with the direction of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, an asylum for the aged, and a hospice for German <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. Affiliated foundations have been made at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (1886), Haifa (1888), Cairo (1904), and <a href="../cathen/05405a.htm">Emmaus</a>. The members of the Trebnitz congregation number 1900, in 211 houses. In 1811 a foundation was made from <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a> at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> whence the congregation spread to other cities of Western <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. In 1849 a provincial house was erected at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> which by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> (18 September, 1872), was made the mother-house of an independent congregation. A famous Borromean institution is St. Hedwig's Hospital at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, founded in 1846 by Angelika Eschweiler. The <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> branch comprises over 1200 sisters in 70 houses. A foundation was also made at Maastricht in 1837 by Peter Anton van Baer.
