<h1>Sisters of Notre Dame (of Cleveland, Ohio)</h1>  

<p>A branch of the congregation founded by <a href="../cathen/08559a.htm">Blessed Julie Billiart</a>. In 1850, Father Elting of Coesfeld, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, aided by the Misses Hildegonda Wollbring and Lisette Kuehling, who became the first members of this community, introduced the Order of Notre dame into <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> were trained by three sisters from the community of Amersfoort, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. Soon they were enabled to open a normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and to take charge of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government objecting to teachers dependent on foreign authority, the sisters were compelled to sever their relations with the mother-house in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and to erect their own at Coesfeld. When in 1871, the <a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a> broke out in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the Sisters of Coesfeld, though they had repeatedly received at the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> state examinations, the highest testimonials as most efficient teachers, were at once expelled. Thereupon, Father Westerholt, of St. Peter's Church, <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>, had Bishop Gilmour invite them to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. On 5 July, 1874, the superioress-general accompanied by eight sisters arrived in New York, and the following day in <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>. Their first home was a small frame house near St. Peter's Church. Two months later they took charge of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls. Presently Bishop Toebbe of <a href="../cathen/04462b.htm">Covington</a>, Ky., invited them to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, where they were first employed as teachers of the Mother of God <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in <a href="../cathen/04462b.htm">Covington</a>. In the autumn of 1874, the sisters began to conduct the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of St. Stephen's, <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>, and of St. Joseph's, Fremont. Within four years of their first arrival on the North American continent, two hundred sisters had been transferred to the missions in <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> and Kentucky. The centre of the community was temporarily at <a href="../cathen/04462b.htm">Covington</a>, where in 1875 a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> with an academy was erected. The same year the superioress-general came to <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>, where the mother-house was built and an academy founded in 1878. In 1883 a girls' boarding-school on Woodland Hills was opened. An academy was founded in <a href="../cathen/14759a.htm">Toledo, Ohio</a>, and opened September, 1904. Since 1877 the Sisters of Notre Dame have been in charge of two <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, one at Cold Springs, Ky., and the other at Bond Hill in the archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>. In May, 1887, the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government allowed the sisters to return and their mother-house was established at Muhlhausen, <a href="../cathen/11415b.htm">Rhenish Prussia</a>. The American branch is under the immediate direction of a provincial superioress, residing in <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>, and numbers 430 sisters. The sisters conduct also upwards of forty <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, mostly in <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> and Kentucky, containing about 14,000 pupils.
