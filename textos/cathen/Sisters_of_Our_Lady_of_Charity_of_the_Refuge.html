<h1>Sisters of Our Lady of Charity of the Refuge</h1>  

<p>The Institute of Our Lady of Charity was founded (1641) by [St. Jean] Eudes, at <a href="../cathen/03132a.htm">Caen</a>, <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, under the title of Our Lady of Refuge. Moved by pity for abandoned <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> living a life of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, P&egrave;re Eudes at first attempted to unite the penitent among them and place them under the care of good and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, but he soon became convinced that the only way of dealing with them was to found a congregation of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who would bind themselves by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to work for the reformation of these unfortunate ones. Three Visitation <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> came to his aid temporarily, and, in 1644, a house was opened at <a href="../cathen/03132a.htm">Caen</a> under the title of Our Lady of Charity. Other ladies joined them, and, in 1651, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02358b.htm">Bayeux</a> gave the institute his <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>. In 1664 a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> was obtained from <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>. That same year a house was opened at <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Rennes</a>, and the institute began to spread. When the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> broke out there were seven communities of the order in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. From this parent-tree of Our Lady of Charity sprang the <a href="../cathen/06647c.htm">Order of the Good Shepherd</a>.

<p>The Sisters of Our Lady of Charity do no limit their work to reclaiming the fallen; they also receive girls who are in danger of being lost or who are being brought up immorally. These form what is called the class of preservation. Government reformatories are attached to some of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. All the houses of this order are independent of each other, and each has its own <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, but the mother-house is still at <a href="../cathen/03132a.htm">Caen</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> wear a white habit and a large silver cross on the breast. To the three ordinary religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> they add a fourth, viz., to devote themselves to the reformation of the fallen. The <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> lasts two years. These sisters came to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1863 and now have houses at Bartestree, Waterlooville, Monmouth, Southampton, Northfield (near Birmingham), and Mold; in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> they have two houses at <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>; in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> they have seventeen: one at <a href="../cathen/03132a.htm">Caen</a>, St-Brieux, <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Rennes</a>, <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a>, Paris, <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a>, <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a>, <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a>, <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a>, <a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">Montauban</a>, <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>, Valognes, and two at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>; in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> they have two houses at both Buffalo and Pittsburg, and one at <a href="../cathen/06777a.htm">Green Bay</a> (Wisconsin), Wheeling (W. Virginia), Hot Springs (Arkansas), <a href="../cathen/13424b.htm">San Antonio</a> and Dallas (Texas); in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> they have houses at <a href="../cathen/11352a.htm">Ottawa</a>, <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a>, and Vancouver; in Mexico, two; in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, one at Loretto; in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, one at Bilboa, and in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, one at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>.

<p>[<em>Note:</em> Jean, or John Eudes, "the Venerable Pere Eudes," was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">St. Pius X</a> in 1909, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Pope Pius XI in 1925. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a> is 19 August.]
