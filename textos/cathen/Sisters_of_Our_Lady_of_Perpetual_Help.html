<h1>Sisters of Our Lady of Perpetual Help</h1>  

<p>A congregation founded in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St. Damien, Bellechasse, P.Q., <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, 28 August, 1892, by Abb&eacute; J.O. Brousseau. The institute devotes itself to the following works: the instruction of children, particularly in country and city <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> and the maintenance of agricultural <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> in which, together with religious instruction and a good <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, children may be given a taste for farming; the care of the aged and infirm of both sexes.

<p>Abb&eacute; J.O. Brousseau laboured earnestly to secure funds for the new foundation and to overcome the obstacles to its progress. The <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> of a number of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the Diocese of Quebec authorized him to seek pecuniary aid, on condition that he would admit some of their aged poor and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> to his institutions. Among those who co&ouml;perated with him was Mlle Virginie Fournier, born at St. Joseph de L&eacute;vis but a resident of <a href="../cathen/05771a.htm">Fall River</a>, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of experience and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>. She became the first superior of the little community which as M&egrave;re St. Bernard she governed for six years, with great success. From the first year of the community's existence, the sisters have conducted the principal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St. Damien. The demand for these religious educators increased and, in 1907, having no more disengaged subjects, they were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to refuse the direction of seventeen municipal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The first profession occurred on 27 March, 1897, when fifteen sisters pronounced the three <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of religion for a year, renewing them annually until the taking of their perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> on 10 July, 1908. The congregation recruits its members from all classes of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, poverty being no obstacle. None are received save those of upright intention, sound judgment, a well-disposed will, and sufficiently robust health. To accept subjects under fifteen years of age and over thirty, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> having already taken either temporary or perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> in another <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have the permission of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The dower is fixed at a hundred dollars; in default of this the aspirant must promise to give instead what will later revert to her by right of inheritance, bequest, or in any other legitimate way. The period of <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulantship</a> lasts six months, that of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">noviceship</a> eighteen months, and after six years, permanent <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are taken.

<p>The institute has so far confined its activities to the Diocese of Quebec. In 1907-08, the constitutions were recast and made conformable to the observations in the "Guide canonique" by Mgr Battandier, the superior-general and her councilors being directed in this work by the Rev. Charles Gonthier, S.J., of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. At present the congregation conducts 21 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>, with 2532 pupils, 1 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> with 44 inmates, and 35 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, and has charge of 50 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>. The order numbers (1911) 112 professed sisters, 8 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, and 12 <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a>.
