<h1>Sisters of Providence</h1>  

<p>(St. Mary-of-the-Woods)

<p>Among the teaching <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders that originated in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> at the close of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> was the Congregation of the Sisters of Providence of Ruill&eacute;sur-Loir, founded in 1806 by M. Jacques-Fran&ccedil;ois Dujari&eacute;, Cur&eacute; of Ruill&eacute; (Sarthe). The <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> had a struggling existence for several years, but was finally established with the collaboration of Jos&eacute;phine Zo&eacute; du Rosco&auml;t, the first superior general. Mother du Rosco&auml;t was of an ancient noble Breton <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and was renowned for her <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, charity, and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. Many followed her to Ruill&eacute; and the community prospered. Though the sisters devoted themselves to various works of mercy and charity, the instruction of youth was their primary object. They soon had <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> not only throughout the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but in distant countries also. In 1839 Rt. Rev. Simon-Gabriel Brut&eacute;, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vincennes, commissioned his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, Mgr de la Hailandi&egrave;re, to return to his native country to procure <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and religious teachers for his immense diocese. Scarcely had he arrived in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> when the death of Bishop Brut&eacute; was announced, followed by the appointment of Mgr de la Hailandi&egrave;re as his successor. The newly-consecrated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> obtained from Mother Mary a colony of religious for <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>. Six sisters, under the leadership of Mother Theodore Gu&eacute;rin, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of exceptional qualifications and high spiritual attainments, reached their home in the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>, 22 Oct., 1840. Instead of being established in the episcopal city, as they had been led to expect, they were taken to a densely wooded country, where only the foundation of a building for them was completed; and they were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to find shelter in a neighbouring farmhouse, one room and a corn loft being at their disposal. After a few weeks the community obtained sole possession of this house, which then became the mother-house, called St. Mary-of-the-Woods. In the summer of 1841 the new building being completed, a boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was opened with seven pupils. In 1841 another member from the French mother-house arrived at St. Mary's, Irma Le Fer de la Motte, Sister <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, who became mistress of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>.

<p>The foundress showed her foresight and capacity for organization and administration, in an <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> plan providing for the advanced studies and culture of the time. As early as 1846, a charter was granted by the State empowering the institution to confer academic honours and collegiate degrees. While the new foundation prospered, many sufferings and hardships were endured, arising from the rigours of the climate, poverty, isolation, a foreign language, troublesome subjects, and the like. The keenest trial of all was misunderstanding with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. It lasted seven years. At the Seventh Council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> placed his difficulties before the assembly and offered his resignation, at the same time strongly denouncing the Sisters of Providence. In 1847, just as he had informed Mother Theodore that he deposed her from her office as superior-general (in which she had, with his consent, been confirmed for life), released her from her <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and dismissed her from her congregation, the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Papal Brief</a> appointing <a href="../cathen/02361b.htm">Bishop Bazin</a> to the See of Vincennes was received from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The death of Mother Theodore occurred 14 May, 1856, and so eminent was her <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> that preliminaries have been undertaken for introducing the cause of her <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>The sisters take simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulantship</a>, two months, is followed by a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of two years, at the end of which <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are taken for three years, renewed then for five years, if the subject is satisfactory and desires to persevere. A year of second <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> precedes the final and perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. This year, during which the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> devote themselves entirely to the spiritual life, is passed at the mother-house. A course of normal training is carried on in connexion with the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> properly so called, and summer sessions are held during the vacation for all teachers who return to the mother-house for the annual retreat, The administrative faculty is an elective body comprising a superior-general and three assistants, a secretary, procuratrix, treasurer, and a general chapter. The rules and constitutions received final approval from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in 1887. Among prominent members of the order were: Sister <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> (Irma Le Fer de la Motte), born at St. Servan, Brittany, 16 April, 1818; died at St. Mary-of-the-Woods, 30 January, 1856, whose life has been published under the title "An Apostolic Woman", and Sister M. Joseph (Elvire le Fer de la Motte), born at St. Servan, 16 February, 1825; died at St. Mary-of-the-Woods, 12 December, 1881, a sketch of whose life has been published in French. The sisters conduct <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and academies in the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>; in the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/07744a.htm">Indianapolis</a>, Ft. Wayne, <a href="../cathen/11661b.htm">Peoria</a>, and Grand Rapids; <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> at Vincennes and Terre Haute; an industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/07744a.htm">Indianapolis</a>; a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> four miles west of Terre Haute. Statistics for 1910 are: 937 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; 68 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; 15 academies; 2 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>; 1 industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; 20,000 children.
