<h1>Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament</h1>  

<p>One of the most recent congregations of religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and one of entirely American origin, founded by Miss Katharine Drexel at Philadelphia, Pa., in 1889, for missionary work among the Indians and coloured people of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The formal <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> was given to the congregation in July, 1907.

<p>The Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> gave a new impetus to missionary work among the coloured and Indian races and as one of the results of its recommendations, Right Reverend James O'Connor, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11249b.htm">Omaha</a>, acting in conjunction with Miss Katherine Drexel, daughter of the late <a href="../cathen/05159a.htm">Francis A. Drexel</a> of Philadelphia, decided with the approval of the Most Reverend P. J. Ryan, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Philadelphia, to form a new congregation of two races. For some years previous to this step, Miss Drexel had been very active in re-establishing and supporting <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in many of the Indian reservations. The survey of the field of work revealed about 250,000 Indians neglected, if not practically abandoned, and over nine million of <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> still struggling through the aftermath of slavery.

<p>The piteous condition of these two races decided Miss Drexel to devote both her fortune and her life to them. With the approval of high church authorities in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> she gathered around her young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> imbued with the same <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, and thus founded, towards the close of 1899, the nucleus of the new community. In order to be well grounded in the principles of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, the first members made a two years' noviiate with the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>. After this, they continued their period of preparation in the old Drexel homestead, Torresdale, near Philadelphia. Early in 1892 a mother-house and <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> were opened at Maud, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, adjoining which was erected a manual training and boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for coloured boys and girls.

<p>The distinctive spirit of this institute is the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of its members, body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to the service to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> ever present in the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>. His Eucharistic life is to be the inspiration of the entire varied activity of the sisters. Besides the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> usual in all <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, the sisters pledge themselves to work exclusively for the spiritual and temporal welfare of the Indian and coloured races. By their rule, the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament may

<ul> <li>undertake all kinds of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> works; <li>they may care for <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> or spiritually or corporally destitute children; <li>they may attend the sick by visiting them in their homes or by conducting <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>;' <li>they may shelter destitute and deserving <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; <li>they may visit and instruct inmates of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a> and reformatories; <li>they may establish and conduct homes for the aged; <li>they may establish <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and classes outside their own houses, visit the poor in order to look after their religious welfare and also to teach them habits of good living, neatness, and thrift-in short, to make them self-sustaining men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. </ul>

<p>The sisterhood now numbers one hundred and twelve members. In 1894, St. Catharine's boarding and industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for Pueblo Indians was opened at <a href="../cathen/13457a.htm">Santa Fe</a>, <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a>; in 1899, the Institute of St. Francis de Sales, Rock Castle, Va., a boarding academy and industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, was opened for the training of Southern coloured girls; in 1902, St. Michael's Mission, <a href="../cathen/01719a.htm">Arizona</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/10720a.htm">Navajo Indians</a>, a boarding and industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, was completed and opened. The Academy of the Immaculate Mother, <a href="../cathen/10704c.htm">Nashville</a>, Tenn., was opened in 1905. In this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> girls are also trained to become teachers, while others not desiring to teach may take a full course of domestic <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and dressmaking. In 1906, the sisters commenced work at <a href="../cathen/03349b.htm">Carlisle</a>, Pa., by instructing the Indian pupils of the Government School, and conducting a day <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for coloured children.
