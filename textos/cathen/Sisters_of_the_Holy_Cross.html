<h1>Sisters of the Holy Cross</h1>  

<p>(Mother House, St. Mary's of the Immaculate Conception, Notre Dame, Indiana)

<p>As an offset to the ravages of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> in the fields of religion and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, the Very Rev. Basil Moreau, professor of divinity in the Grand S&eacute;minaire and canon of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, formed a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of auxiliary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in 1834. The following year his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/02723c.htm">Mgr. Bouvier</a>, named him superior of the Brothers of St. Joseph, who had been founded for <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> work in 1820 by the Rev. Jacques-Fran&ccedil;ois Dujari&eacute;. "The Association of the Holy Cross" was the outgrowth of these two distinct communities banded together under Abb&eacute; Moreau for <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> purposes in the Commune of the Holy Cross near <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a>, where they started Holy Cross College in 1836. Several young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> offering their assistance a little later, Father Moreau founded a sisterhood "to co-operate with the other branches in their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> labours, and to labour themselves in a particular manner for the benefit of the youth of their own sex". The first candidates received the habit of the Congregation of the Seven Dolours (as it was then called) from Father Moreau on 29 September, 1841, in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Good Shepherd. Under the direction of its saintly superior, Mother Dorothea, they made their <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, and, at the end of a year, were admitted to the <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> with the title, "Sisters of the Holy Cross". They were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by their founder "to the heart of Mary pierced with the sword of grief". This has ever been the especial devotion of the sisters, and the image of Our Lady of Sorrows is a distinctive mark of their dress. They wear also in her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> a blue <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a> and the chaplet of the Seven Dolours, which is recited in common every day.

<p>In 1842 the sisters with Mother Seven Dolours took possession of their new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Holy Cross. About this time, the <a href="../cathen/14150a.htm">Rev. Edward Sorin</a> and five brothers left the mother-house for the <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a> Missions at the request of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vincennes. It is evident from <a href="../cathen/14150a.htm">Father Sorin's</a> letters that he expected the sisters to join him later in his work. He writes that they should come prepared for teaching, establishing an academy, and for the Indian missions. Four sisters left <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> with Father Cointet on 6 June, 1843. A second story had been added to the log <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> at Notre Dame for their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. Upon their arrival, they took charge of the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>, infirmary, clothes room, etc. Before long the need of an American <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> was apparent as it was out of the question to send candidates to <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a> from <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>. <a href="../cathen/14150a.htm">Father Sorin</a> asked the ordinary's permission to establish one, but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> refused because he thought his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> could not support two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a>, and the Sisters of Providence were already there by his invitation. Finally, in 1844 the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> was opened with the sanction of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a> at Bertrand, <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, six miles from Notre Dame. This mission was attended by the Holy Cross <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The first American <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a> received the habit from <a href="../cathen/14150a.htm">Father Sorin</a> on 8 September, 1844. The sisters taught the children of the neighbourhood, and cared for several <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>. In 1845 the inhabitants gave them a large tract of land; and this with five thousand francs from the <a href="../cathen/12461a.htm">Society of the Propagation of the Faith</a> made it possible for the sisters to extend their work. The French sisters had already mastered the English tongue, while their American companions were studying the dialect of the Pottawattomies. Those destined for music and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> attended Loretta Convent, Kentucky; others went to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to specialize in the instruction of deaf-mutes.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for Indians was opened at Pokagon, <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, in 1845. This was followed by other foundations at St. John's, Mackinac, <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, Lowell (Indiana), Laporte, Michigan City, and Mishawaka. In 1847 four sisters with some companions from the mother-house in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> opened a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at St. Laurent, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, which formed the nucleus of the subsequently erected province. In 1849 four sisters took charge of the boys' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> in <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, and from there a house was opened in New York with the sanction of Father Moreau (1854). Sisters were sent to this establishment from Notre Dame, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>. Misunderstandings due to orders issued from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and Notre Dame led to the withdrawal of the American sisters from the new foundations, the houses of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> and New York remaining subject to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The year 1856 saw the sisters well-established in <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> and Philadelphia. They had charge of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, St. Joseph's German <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and an industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, and were installed in St. Paul's and St. Augustine's <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in Philadelphia. Later they opened a select <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boarders and day-pupils in West Philadelphia. These foundations all promised success, but the strained relations between the mother-house at <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a> under Father Moreau and the Provincial House at Notre Dame under <a href="../cathen/14150a.htm">Father Sorin</a> led to the recall of the sisters. Meanwhile the work at St. Mary's, Bertrand, was recognized by the state authorities who granted its charter in 1851. New buildings were added to accommodate their fifty boarders. In 1853, <a href="../cathen/06560a.htm">Eliza Gillespie</a> received the habit from <a href="../cathen/14150a.htm">Father Sorin</a>, and sailed for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to make her <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> as Sister Angela. After profession, she returned to Bertrand and took charge of the academy, 1854. From that time until her death (1887), Mother Angela laboured indefatigably to develop the highest <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and religious qualities in both teachers and students, and must be regarded as the virtual foundress of the order in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.

<p>On 15 August, 1855, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and academy were moved from Bertrand to the present site on the banks of the St. Joseph. This institution, "St. Mary's of the Immaculate Conception", was incorporated under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>. In the early days of the community, <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was held in common by the three branches of the Holy Cross. When Father Moreau visited the provinces of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, and Notre Dame in 1857, he <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of Separation of the sisters from the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and brothers. In 1862 the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was divided. Difficulties again arising with the mother-house, Bishop Luers of <a href="../cathen/06150a.htm">Fort Wayne</a> sent a petition to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> asking the approval of the American province, and in 1869 the Sisters of the Holy Cross in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> were recognized as a distinct Congregation. <a href="../cathen/14150a.htm">Father Sorin</a>, who had on the resignation of Father Moreau become superior general, was named their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior, which office he held until the community was placed directly under the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>. The new constitutions were approved, and <a href="../cathen/14150a.htm">Father Sorin</a> was appointed to write the rules. Twenty years later, the apostolic <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the rules was given for seven years, at the end of which time the final <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> was received (1896).

<p>While the work of the Holy Cross Sisters is principally <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a>, they also devote themselves to the care of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> for the sick. During the Civil War Mother Angela with seventy sisters took charge of <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> in Mound City and Cairo; the military <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> at Paducah and Louisville; the naval <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and "The Overton" at <a href="../cathen/10176a.htm">Memphis</a>; and St. Aloysius at Washington.

<p>The community is governed by the mother general and her four assistants who form the council at the mother-house. All the missions are dependent upon the mother-house for their subjects, as there is only one <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> return there from all parts of the country to make their final <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> after five years' probation. There are one thousand sisters working in the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, New York, and San Francisco, and in the various <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. They conduct over 60 institutions, including 1 college, 2 normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 16 boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 40 academies and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 6 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and 4 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>.
