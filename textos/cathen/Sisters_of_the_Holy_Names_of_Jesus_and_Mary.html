<h1>Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary</h1>  

<p>A religious congregation founded at Longueuil, Quebec, 8 December, 1844, under the patronage of Bishop Bourget, of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of young girls. The mother-house is at Hochelaga, <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. The institute was incorporated by Act of the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> Parliament 17 March, 1845. A <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> <em>cum laude</em> was issued by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, 27 February, 1863, and a further <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 4 September, 187, approved the institute; the constitutions received definite approval 26 June, 1901, and the institute was divided into seven provinces, 11 May, 1894, later increased to nine, 25 August, 1910. Under the direction of Rev. J. Allard three <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> aspirants &#151; Miss Eulalie Durocher, Miss Henriette C&eacute;r&eacute;, and Miss M&eacute;lodie Dufresne &#151; were trained according to the institute of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary established by <a href="../cathen/10094a.htm">Mgr. Eugene de Mazenod</a> of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>. The took simple religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> at Longueuil, 8 December, 1844, as Sisters Marie-Rose, Marie-Madeline, and Marie-Agnes. Bishop Bourget gave the institute <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> approval and appointed Mother Marie-Rose, general superior for life. The community at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> supplied the title of the congregation and, with modifications, the habit and the rule. Under Mother Marie-Rose, the congregation developed rapidly, and a course of study providing equally for English pupils and French was sketched on lines sufficiently broad to cover subsequent requirements. The teaching of boys was not at first contemplated, but missionary conditions rendering it imperative in certain provinces, permission from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> has been temporarily obtained. The postulate lasts six months. At the end of the canonical year <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> are sent for six additional months to the different houses, where they become practically acquainted with the life of the community. After five years, the young religious reconsiders her vocation during a retreat of thirty days. Final <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are perpetual. Young girls desiring of leading a hidden life in the apostolate of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, or possessing little aptitude for instruction, may enter as auxiliary sisters. Their spiritual preparation is similar to that of the choir sisters, and save for minor details in dress, no outward distinctions exist between the two classes. A general superior elected for five years, who may not be chosen for more than two consecutive terms, governs the entire congregation, assisted by four councillors. A general chapter assembles periodically to deliberate upon the major concerns of the institute.

<p>In 1859 <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Archbishop Blanchet</a> of <a href="../cathen/11293a.htm">Oregon City</a>, <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, secured twelve sisters for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Several years later, they were invited to <a href="../cathen/13665a.htm">Seattle</a>, Washington. Today these two States form one province, with a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> (1871) and provincial headquarters at St. Mary's Academy and College, Portland. This <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was empowered to confer degrees (July, 1893), also to grant a Teachers' State Certificate good for five years, and a Teachers' State Diploma qualifying the holder for life. In 1907, an Act of the Washington State Legislature, afterwards ratified by the State Board of Education, accredited the Holy Names' Academics at <a href="../cathen/13665a.htm">Seattle</a> and Spokane, as State Normal Schools. Two other provinces are located in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. that of <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, established at Oakland (1868) by <a href="../cathen/01282a.htm">Bishop Alemany</a>, possesses a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> since 1871; the New York province includes Florida. Quebec has four provinces; <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a>, one; Manitoba, one. Attached to <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a> are <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a> and <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>. St. Mary's Portland, opened (1860) a refuge for destitute and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphaned</a> children and still conducts a Home for Orphan Girls. The congregation numbers (1910) professed sisters, 1257; <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, 110; <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a>, 81. It conducts 99 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, residential, select, and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a>, attended by 24, 208 pupils. Of these establishments, 48 are in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.
