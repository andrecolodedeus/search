<h1>Sisters of the Perpetual Adoration</h1>  

<p>(Quimper, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>).

<p>An institute of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> devoted to perpetual adoration of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> children; founded at <a href="../cathen/12611a.htm">Quimper</a> (Brittany), by Abb&eacute; Fran&ccedil;ois-Marie Langrez (b. at Saint Servan, 20 July, 1787; d. at <a href="../cathen/12611a.htm">Quimper</a>, 10 August, 1862). In early youth Francois-Marie had been an apprentice rope-maker, but he began to study the classics at sixteen, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> 19 December, 1812. In December, 1821, he conceived the first <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the work he subsequently founded. Two poor homeless little girls crossed his path. He confided them to Marguerite Le Ma&icirc;tre, a domestic servant. Other <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> were found and sheltered. In 1826 Marguerite's home contained an oratory and was provided with a dormitory holding thirty beds. Three years later she received her first two co-labourers, and on 21 November, 1829, the first <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the institute was opened. In 1832, Mlle Olympe de Moelien, in whose <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> Marguerite Le Maitre had been a servant when she began her charitable work, entered the little <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, being made superioress, 10 March, 1833. On 20 January, 1835, M&egrave;re Olympe and her companions first put on the religious habit. In September, 1835 a tentative rule of life was drawn up by Abb&eacute; Langrez. In March, 1836, the first sisters made their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. On 27 March, 1837, Sister Marguerite Le Ma&icirc;tre died. Adoration of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> which was begun in March, 1836, did not become perpetual, day and night, till 1843, eight days after the death of M&egrave;re Olympe, who left after her a great <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. At that time the community numbered 11 choir sisters, 4 <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a>, and had charge of 70 children. In 1845 their rule was approved by Mgr Graveran, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12611a.htm">Quimper</a>. A little later they were recognized by the Government under the title of Sisters of the Perpetual Adoration. On 10 May, 1851, a house was founded at Recouvrance, transferred, 28 October, 1856, to Coat-ar-Gu&eacute;ven, near Brest. This and the house at <a href="../cathen/12611a.htm">Quimper</a> are the only ones that practise perpetual adoration. In 1882, the institute contained 400 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> girls and 128 religious. Since its foundation, it has received 1754 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> girls, of whom 1000 have embraced the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> in different congregations.
