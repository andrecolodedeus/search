<h1>Slavery and Christianity</h1>  

<p>How numerous the slaves were in Roman <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> when <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> made its appearance, how hard was their lot, and how the competition of slave labour crushed free labour is <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a>. It is the scope of this article to show what <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> has done for slaves and against slavery, first in the Roman world, next in that <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> which was the result of the barbarian invasions, and lastly in the modern world.
<h2 id="section1">The Church and Roman slavery</h2>

<p>The first missionaries of the Gospel, men of Jewish origin, came from a country where slavery existed. But it existed in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> under a form very different from the Roman form. The <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a> was merciful to the slave (<a href="../bible/exo021.htm">Exodus 21</a>; <a href="../bible/lev025.htm">Leviticus 25</a>; <a href="../bible/deu015.htm#vrs21">Deuteronomy 15:21</a>) and carefully secured his fair wage to the labourer (<a href="../bible/deu024.htm#vrs15">Deuteronomy 24:15</a>). In Jewish <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> the slave was not an object of contempt, because labour was not despised as it was elsewhere. No man thought it beneath him to ply a manual trade. These <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and habits of life the Apostles brought into the new <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> which so rapidly grew up as the effect of their preaching. As this <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> included, from the first, faithful of all conditions &#151; rich and poor, slaves and freemen &#151; the Apostles were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to utter their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> as to the social inequalities which so profoundly divided the Roman world. "For as many of you as have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in Christ, have put on Christ. There is neither <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> nor Greek: there is neither bond nor free: there is neither male nor <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a>. For you are all one in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>" (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#vrs27">Galatians 3:27-28</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#vrs13">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>). From this principle <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> draws no political conclusions. It was not his wish, as it was not in his power, to realize <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> equality either by force or by revolt. Such revolutions are not effected of a sudden. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> accepts <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> as it is, influencing it for its transformation through, and only through, individual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. What it demands in the first place from masters and from slaves is, to live as brethren &#151; commanding with equity, without threatening, remembering that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the master of all - obeying with fear, but without servile flattery, in simplicity of heart, as they would obey Christ (cf. <a href="../bible/eph006.htm#vrs9">Ephesians 6:9</a>; <a href="../bible/col003.htm#vrs22">Colossians 3:22-4</a>; <a href="../bible/col004.htm#vrs1">4:1</a>).

<p>This language was understood by masters and by slaves who became converts to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. But many slaves who were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> had <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> masters to whom this sentiment of fraternity was unknown, and who sometimes exhibited that cruelty of which <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moralists</a> and poets so often speak. To such slaves St. Peter points out their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>: to be submissive "not only to the good and gentle, but also to the forward", not with a mere inert resignation, but to give a good example and to imitate Christ, Who also suffered <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> (<a href="../bible/1pe002.htm">1 Peter 2:18, 23-4</a>). In the eyes of the Apostles, a slave's condition, peculiarly wretched, peculiarly exposed to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, bears all the more efficacious testimony to the new religion. St. Paul recommends slaves to seek in all things to please their masters, not to contradict them, to do them no wrong, to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> them, to be loyal to them, so as to make the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">God Our Saviour</a> shine forth before the eyes of all, and to prevent that name and teaching from being blasphemed (cf. <a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#vrs1">1 Timothy 6:1</a>; <a href="../bible/tit002.htm#vrs9">Titus 2:9, 10</a>). The apostolic writings show how large a place slaves occupied in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Nearly all the names of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> whom St. Paul salutes in his Epistles to the Romans are servile <em>cognomina</em>: the two groups whom he calls "those of the household of Aristobulus" and "those of the household of Narcissus" indicate <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> servitors of those two contemporaries of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>. His Epistle, written from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to the Philippians (iv, 22) bears them greeting from the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of Caesar's household, i.e. converted slaves of the imperial palace.

<p>One fact which, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, relieved the condition of the slave was the absence among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the ancient scorn of labour (Cicero, "De off.", I, xlii; "Pro Flacco", xviii; "pro domo", xxxiii; Suetonius, "Claudius, xxii; Seneca, "De beneficiis", xviii; Valerius Maximus, V, ii, 10). Converts to the new religion <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had been a carpenter; they saw St. Paul exercise the occupation of a tentmaker (<a href="../bible/act018.htm#vrs3">Acts 18:3</a>; <a href="../bible/1co004.htm#vrs12">1 Corinthians 4:12</a>). "Neither did we eat any man's bread", said the Apostle, "for nothing, but in labour and in toil we worked night and day, lest we should be chargeable to any of you" (<a href="../bible/2th003.htm#vrs8">2 Thessalonians 3:8</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/act020.htm#vrs33">Acts 20:33, 34</a>). Such an example, given at a time when those who laboured were accounted "the dregs of the city", and those who did not labour lived on the public bounty, constituted a very efficacious form of preaching. A new sentiment was thereby introduced into the Roman world, while at the same time a formal discipline was being established in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It would have none of those who made a parade of their leisurely curiosity in the Greek and Roman cities (<a href="../bible/2th003.htm#vrs11">2 Thessalonians 3:11</a>). It declared that those who do not labour do not deserve to be fed (ibid., 10). A <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> was not permitted to live without an occupation (Didache, xii).



<p>Religious equality was the negation of slavery as it was practiced by <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. It must have been an exaggeration, no doubt, to say, as one author of the first century said, that "slaves had no religion, or had only foreign <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>" (Tacitus, "Annals", XIV, xliv): many were members of funerary <em>collegia</em> under the invocation of Roman divinities (Statutes of the College of Lanuvium, "Corp. Inscr. lat.", XIV, 2112). But in many circumstances this haughty and formalist religion excluded slaves from its functions, which, it was held, their presence would have defiled. (Cicero, "Octavius", xxiv). Absolute religious equality, as proclaimed by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, was therefore a novelty. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> made no account of the social condition of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Bond and free received the same <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Clerics of servile origin were numerous (St. Jerome, Ep. lxxxii). The very Chair of St. Peter was occupied by men who had been slaves &#151; <a href="../cathen/12126b.htm">Pius</a> in the second century, Callistus in the third. So complete &#151; one might almost say, so levelling &#151; was this <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> equality that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#vrs2">1 Timothy 6:2</a>), and, later, St. Ignatius (Polyc., iv), are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to admonish the slave and the handmaid not to contemn their masters, "believers like them and sharing in the same benefits". In giving them a place in religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> restored to slaves the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and marriage. In Roman law, neither legitimate marriage, nor regular paternity, nor even impediment to the most unnatural unions had existed for the slave (Digest, XXXVIII, viii, i, (<a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>) 2; X, 10, (<a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>) 5). That slaves often endeavoured to override this abominable position is touchingly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by innumerable mortuary inscriptions; but the name of <em>uxor</em>, which the slave <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> takes in these inscriptions, is very precarious, for no law protects her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and with her there is no <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> (Digest, XLVIII, v, 6; Cod. Justin., IX, ix, 23). In the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the marriage of slaves is a sacrament; it possesses "the solidity" of one (<a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, Ep. cxcix, 42). The Apostolic Constitutions impose upon the master the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of making his slave contract "a legitimate marriage" (III, iv; VIII, xxxii). <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> declares that slaves have the marital power over their wives and the paternal over their children ("In Ep. ad Ephes.", Hom. xxii, 2). He says that "he who has immoral relations with the wife of a slave is as culpable as he who has the like relations with the wife of the prince: both are adulterers, for it is not the condition of the parties that makes the crime" ("In I Thess.", Hom. v, 2; "In II Thess.", Hom. iii, 2).

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> cemeteries there is no difference between the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of slaves and those of the free. The inscriptions on <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> sepulchres &#151; whether the <em>columbarium</em> common to all the servants of one household, or the burial plot of a funerary <em>collegium</em> of slaves or freedmen, or isolated <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> &#151; always indicate the servile condition. In <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> epitaphs it is hardly ever to be seen ("Bull. di archeol. christiana", 1866, p. 24), though slaves formed a considerable part of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> population. Sometimes we find a slave <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> with a more pretentious sepulchre than others of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, like that of Ampliatus in the cemetery of <a href="../cathen/06098b.htm">Domitilla</a> ("Bull. di archeol. christ.", 1881, pp. 57-54, and pl. III, IV). This is particularly so in the case of slaves who were <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>: the ashes of two slaves, Protus and Hyacinthus, burned alive in the <a href="../cathen/15256b.htm">Valerian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, had been wrapped in a winding-sheet of gold tissue (ibid., 1894, p. 28). Martyrdom eloquently manifests the religious equality of the slave: he displays as much firmness before the menaces of the persecutor as does the free man. Sometimes it is not for the Faith alone that a slave <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> dies, but for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and chastity equally threatened &#151; "pro fide et castitate occisa est" ("Acta S. Dulae" in Acta SS., III March, p. 552). Beautiful assertions of this moral freedom are found in the accounts of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> of the slaves Ariadne, Blandina, Evelpistus, Potamienna, Felicitas, Sabina, Vitalis, Porphyrus, and many others (see Allard, "Dix le&ccedil;ons sur le martyre", 4th ed., pp. 155-- 64). The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> made the enfranchisement of the slave an act of disinterested charity. <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Pagan</a> masters usually sold him his liberty for his market value, on receipt of his painfully amassed savings (Cicero, "Philipp. VIII", xi; Seneca "Ep. lxxx"); <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> gave it to him as an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Sometimes the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> redeemed slaves out of its common resources (St. Ignatius, "Polyc.", 4; Apos. Const., IV, iii). Heroic <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are known to have sold themselves into slavery to deliver slaves (St. Clement, "Cor.", 4; "Vita S. Joannis Eleemosynarii" in Acts SS., Jan., II, p. 506). Many enfranchised all the slaves they had. In <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> antiquity wholesale enfranchisements are frequent, but they never include all the owner's slaves, end they are always by testamentary disposition &#151; that is when the owner cannot be impoverished by his own bounty, (Justinian, "Inst.", I, vii; "Cod. Just.", VII, iii, 1). Only <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> enfranchised all their slaves in the owner's lifetime, thus effectually despoiling themselves a considerable part of their fortune (see Allard, "Les esclaves chr&eacute;tiens", 4th ed., p. 338). At the beginning of the fifth century, a Roman millionaire, St. Melania, gratuitously granted liberty to so many thousand of slaves that her biographer declares himself unable to give their exact number (Vita S. Melaniae, xxxiv). <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a> mentions eight thousand slaves freed (Hist. Lausiaca, cxix), which, taking the average price of a slave as about $100, would represent a value of $800,000 [1913 dollars]. But <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a> wrote before 406, which was long before Melania had completely exhausted her immense fortune in acts of liberality of all kinds (Rampolla, "S. Melania Giuniore", 1905, p. 221).

<p>Primitive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> did not attack slavery directly; but it acted as though slavery did not exist. By inspiring the best of its children with this heroic charity, examples of which have been given above, it remotely prepared the way for the abolition of slavery. To reproach the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the first ages with not having condemned slavery in principle, and with having tolerated it in fact, is to blame it for not having let loose a frightful revolution, in which, perhaps, all civilization would have perished with Roman <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. But to say, with Ciccotti (Il tramonto della schiavit&ugrave;, Fr. tr., 1910, pp. 18, 20), that primitive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had not even "an embryonic vision" of a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> in which there should be no slavery, to say that the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> did not feel "the horror of slavery", is to display either strange <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or singular unfairness. In <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a> (In Ecclesiastem, hom. iv) the most energetic and absolute reprobation of slavery may be found; and again in numerous passages of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom's</a> discourse we have the picture of a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> without slaves - a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> composed only of free workers, an ideal portrait of which he traces with the most eloquent insistence (see the texts cited in Allard, ''Les esclaves chr&eacute;tiens", p. 416-23).
<h2 id="section2">The Church and slavery after the barbarian invasions</h2>

<p>It is beyond the scope of this article to discuss the legislative movement which took place during the same period in regard to slaves. From <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> to Constantine <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> tended to afford them greater protection against ill-treatment and to facilitate enfranchisement. Under the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperors this tendency, in spite of relapses at certain points, became daily more marked, and ended, in the sixth century, in Justinian's very liberal legislation (see <a href="../cathen/15539a.htm">Wallon</a>, "Hist. de l'esclavage dans l'antiquit&eacute;", III, ii and x). Although the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> on slavery still lagged behind the demands of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> ("The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of Caesar are one thing, the laws of Christ another", <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> writes in "Ep. lxxvii"), nevertheless very great progress had been made. It continued in the Eastern Empire (laws of Basil the Macedonian, of Leo the Wise, of Constantine Porphyrogenitus), but in the West it was abruptly checked by the barbarian invasions. Those invasions were calamitous for the slaves, increasing their numbers which had began to diminish, and subjecting them to legislation and to customs much harder than those which obtained under the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> of the period (see Allard, "Les origines du servage" in "Rev. des questions historiques", April, 1911). Here again the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> intervened. It did so in three ways: redeeming slaves; legislating for their benefit in its councils; setting an example of kind treatment. Documents of the fifth to the seventh century are full of instances of captives carried off from conquered cities by the barbarians and doomed to slavery, whom <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> redeemed. Redeemed captives were sometimes sent back in thousands to their own country (ibid., p. 393-7, and Lesne, "Hist de la propri&eacute;t&eacute; eccl&eacute;siastique en France", 1910, pp. 357-69).

<p>The Churches of Gaul, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, Britain, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> were incessantly busy, in numerous councils, with the affairs of slaves; protection of the maltreated slave who has taken refuge in a church (Councils of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, 511, 538, 549; Council of Epone, 517); those manumitted in ecclesiis, but also those freed by any other process (Council of Arles, 452; of <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Agde</a>, 506; of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, 549; of <a href="../cathen/09507a.htm">M&acirc;con</a>, 585; of Toledo, 589, 633; of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 615); validity of marriage contracted with full <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the circumstances between free <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and slaves (Councils of Verberie, 752, of Compi&egrave;gne, 759); rest for slaves on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feast days (Council of Auxerre, 578 or 585; of Ch&acirc;lon-sur-Sa&ocirc;ne, middle of the seventh century; of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, 650; of Wessex, 691; of Berghamsted, 697); prohibition of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to possess <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> slaves (Council of Orl&eacute;ans, 541; of <a href="../cathen/09507a.htm">M&acirc;con</a>, 581; of Clichy, 625; of Toledo, 589, 633, 656); suppression of traffic in slaves by forbidding their sale outside the kingdom (Council of Ch&acirc;lon-sur-Sa&ocirc;ne, between 644 and 650); prohibition against reducing a free man to slavery (Council of Clichy, 625). Less liberal in this respect than Justinian (Novella cxxiii, 17), who made tacit consent a sufficient condition, the Western discipline does not permit a slave to be raised to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> without the formal consent of his master; nevertheless the councils held at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> in 511, 538, 549, while imposing canonical penalties upon the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who exceeded his authority in this matter, declare such an <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to be valid. A council held at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 595 under the presidency of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> permits the slave to become a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> without any consent, express or tacit, of his master.

<p>At this period the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> found itself becoming a great proprietor. Barbarian converts endowed it largely with real <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. As these estates were furnished with serfs attached to the cultivation of the soil, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> became by force of circumstances a proprietor of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human beings</a>, for whom, in these troublous times, the relation was a great blessing. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the barbarians, amended through <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> influence, gave <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> serfs a privileged position: their rents were fixed; ordinarily, they were bound to give the proprietor half of their labour or half of its products, the remainder being left to them (Lex Alemannorum, xxii; Lex Bajuvariorum, I, xiv, 6). A council of the sixth century (Eauze, 551) enjoins upon <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> that they must exact of their serfs a lighter service than that performed by the serfs of lay proprietors, and must remit to them one-fourth of their rents.

<p>Another advantage of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> serfs was the permanency of their position. A <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> of the middle of the fourth century (Cod. Just., XI, xlvii, 2) had forbidden rural slaves to be removed from the lands to which they belonged; this was the origin of serfdom, a much better condition than slavery properly so called. But the barbarians virtually suppressed this beneficent law (<a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a>, "Hist. Franc.", VI, 45); it was even formally abrogated among the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> by the edict of <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> (<a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. 142). Nevertheless, as an exceptional privilege, it remained in force for the serfs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who, like the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself remained under <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> (Lex Burgondionum, LVIII, i; Louis I, "Add. ad legem Langobard.", III, i). They shared besides, the inalienability of all <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> which had been established by councils (Rome, 50; Orl&eacute;ans, 511, 538; Epone, 517; Clichy, 625; Toledo, 589); they were sheltered from the exactions of the royal officers by the immunity granted to almost all church lands (Kroell, "L'immunit&eacute; franque", 19110); thus their position was generally <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envied</a> (<a href="../cathen/06105a.htm">Flodoard</a>, "Hist eccl. Remensis", I, xiv), and when the royal liberality assigned to a church a portion of land out of the state <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, the serfs who cultivated were loud in their expression of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> (Vita S. Eligii, I, xv).

<p>It has been asserted that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> serfs were less fortunately situated because the inalienability of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> prevented their being enfranchised. But this is inexact. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> enfranchised serfs of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> (Ep. vi, 12), and there is frequent discussion in the councils in regard to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> freedmen. The <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Council of Agde</a> (506) gives the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to enfranchise those serfs "who shall have deserved it" and to leave them a small patrimony. A Council of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> (541) declares that even if the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has dissipated the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of his church, the serfs whom he has freed in reasonable number (<em>numero competenti</em>) are to remain free. A Merovingian formula shows a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> enfranchising one-tenth of his serfs (Formulae Biturgenses, viii). The Spanish councils imposed greater restrictions, recognizing the right of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to enfranchise the serfs of his church on condition of his indemnifying it out of his own private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> (Council of Seville, 590; of Toledo, 633; of <a href="../cathen/10202a.htm">M&eacute;rida</a>, 666). But they made it <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> to enfranchise the serf in whom a serious vocation was discerned (Council of Saragossa, 593). An English council (Celchyte, 816) orders that at the death of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> all the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and all the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> shall enfranchise three slaves each for the repose of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. This last clause shows again the mistake of saying that the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> had not the right of manumission. The canon of the Council of Epone (517) which forbids <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> to enfranchise their serfs was enacted in order that the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> might not be left to work without assistance and has been taken too literally. It is inspired not only by agricultural <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, but also by the consideration that the serfs belong to the community of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and not to the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> individually. Moreover, the rule of St. Ferr&eacute;ol (sixth century) permits the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> to free serfs with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, or without their consent, if, in the latter case, he replaces at his own expense those he has enfranchised. The statement that <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> freedmen were not as free as the freedmen of lay proprietors will not bear examination in the light of facts, which shows the situation of the two classes to have been identical, except that the freedman of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> earned a higher <em>wergheld</em> than a lay freedman, and therefore his life was better protected. The "Polyptych of Irminon", a detailed description of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> lands of Saint-Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s shows that in the ninth century the serfs of that domain were not numerous and led in every way the life of free peasants.
<h2 id="section3">The Church and modern slavery</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> slavery, properly so called, no longer existed in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> countries; it had been replaced by serfdom, an intermediate condition in which a man enjoyed all his personal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> except the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to leave the land he cultivated and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to freely dispose of his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. Serfdom soon disappeared in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries, to last longer only where the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant Reformation</a> prevailed. But while serfdom was becoming extinct, the course of events was bringing to pass a temporary revival of slavery. As a consequence of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a> and the commerce maintained with the East, the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> countries bordering on the Mediterranean, particularly <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, once more had slaves &#151; <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> and also, unfortunately, captives imported by conscienceless traders. Though these slaves were generally well-treated, and set at liberty if they asked for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, this revival of slavery, lasting until the seventeenth century, is a blot on <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian civilization</a>. But the number of these slaves was always very small in comparison with that of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> captives reduced to slavery in <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> countries, particularly in the Barbary states from Tripoli to the Atlantic coast of <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a>. These captives were cruelly treated and were in constant danger of losing their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Many actually did deny their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or, at least, were driven by despair to abandon all religion and all morality. Religious orders were founded to succour and redeem them.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15045d.htm">Trinitarians</a>, founded in 1198 by St. John of Matha and <a href="../cathen/06033c.htm">St. Felix of Valois</a>, established <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> for slaves at <a href="../cathen/01311a.htm">Algiers</a> and <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a> in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; and from its foundation until the year 1787 it redeemed 900,000 slaves. The <a href="../cathen/10197b.htm">Order of Our Lady of Ransom (Mercedarians)</a>, founded in the thirteenth century by <a href="../cathen/11770b.htm">St. Peter Nolasco</a>, and established more especially in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, redeemed 490,736 slaves between the years 1218 and 1632. To the three regular <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> its founder had added a fourth, "To become a hostage in the hands of the infidels, if that is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the deliverance of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">Christ's faithful</a>." Many <a href="../cathen/10197b.htm">Mercedarians</a> kept this <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> even to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Another order undertook not only to redeem captives, but also to give them spiritual and material assistance. <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent of Paul</a> had been a slave at <a href="../cathen/01311a.htm">Algiers</a> in 1605, and had witnessed the sufferings and perils of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> slaves. At the request of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, he sent them, in 1642, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the congregation which he had founded. Many of these <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, indeed, were invested with consular functions at <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a> and at <a href="../cathen/01311a.htm">Algiers</a>. From 1642 to 1660 they redeemed about 1200 slaves at an expense of about 1,200,000 <em>livres</em>. But their greatest achievements were in teaching the Catechism and converting thousands, and in preparing many of the captives to suffer the most cruel <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> rather than deny the Faith. As a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> historian has recently said, none of the expeditions sent against the Barbary States by the Powers of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, or even America, equalled "the moral effect produced by the ministry of consolation, and abnegation, going even to the sacrifice of liberty and life, which was exercised by the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> sons of St. John of Matha, <a href="../cathen/11770b.htm">St. Peter Nolasco</a>, and St. Vincent of Paul" (Bonet-Maury, "France, christianisme et civilisation", 1907, p. 142).

<p>A second revival of slavery took place after the discovery of the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> in 1492. To give the history of it would be to exceed the limits of this article. It will be sufficient to recall the efforts of <a href="../cathen/03397a.htm">Las Casas</a> in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">aborigines of America</a> and the protestations of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> against the enslavement of those aborigines and the traffic in <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> slaves. <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, all participated in this nefarious traffic. <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> only made amends for its transgressions when, in 1815, it took the initiative in the suppression of the slave trade. In 1871 a writer had the temerity to assert that the <a href="../cathen/11451b.htm">Papacy</a> had not its mind to condemn slavery" (Ernest Havet, "Le christianisme et ses origines", I, p. xxi). He forgot that, in 1462, <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> declared slavery to be "a great crime" (<em>magnum scelus</em>); that, in 1537, <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> forbade the enslavement of the Indians; that <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> forbade it in 1639, and <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> in 1741; that <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> demanded of the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, in 1815, the suppression of the slave trade and <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> condemned it in 1839; that, in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of Canonization of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/11763a.htm">Peter Claver</a>, one of the most illustrious adversaries of slavery, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> branded the "supreme villainy" (<em>summum nefas</em>) of the slave traders. Everyone knows of the beautiful letter which <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, in 1888, addressed to the <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazilian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, exhorting them to banish from their country the remnants of slavery &#151; a letter to which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> responded with their most energetic efforts, and some generous slave-owners by freeing their slaves in a body, as in the first ages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>In our own times the slave trade still continued to devastate Africa, no longer for the profit of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> states, from which all slavery had disappeared, but for the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> countries. But as <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> penetrations progresses in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, the missionaries, who are always its precursors &#151; <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Fathers of the Holy Ghost</a>, Oblates, <a href="../cathen/15613d.htm">White Fathers</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Priests of the Mission of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> &#151; labour in the Sudan, Guinea, on the Gabun, in the region of the Great Lakes, redeeming slaves and establishing "liberty villages." At the head of this movement appear two men: <a href="../cathen/09050d.htm">Cardinal Lavigerie</a>, who in 1888 founded the <em>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Antiesclavagiste</em> and in 1889 promoted the <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> conference; <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, who encouraged <a href="../cathen/09050d.htm">Lavigerie</a> in all his projects, and, in 1890, by an <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> once more condemning the slave-traders and "the accursed pest of servitude", ordered an annual collection to be made in all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches for the benefit of the anti-slavery work. Some modern writers, mostly of the <a href="../cathen/14062a.htm">Socialist School</a> &#151; Karl Marx, Engel, Ciccotti, and, in a measure, Seligman &#151; attribute the now almost complete disappearance of slavery to the evolution of interests and to <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> causes only. The foregoing exposition of the subject is an answer to their materialistic conception of history, as showing that, if not the only, at least the principal, cause of that disappearance is <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> acting through the authority of its <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">teaching</a> and the influence of its <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charity</a>.
