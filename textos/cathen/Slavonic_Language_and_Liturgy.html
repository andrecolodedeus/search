<h1>Slavonic Language and Liturgy</h1>  

<p>Although the Latin holds the chief place among the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> languages in which the Mass is celebrated and the praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> recited in the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Offices</a>, yet the Slavonic language comes next to it among the languages widely used throughout the world in the liturgy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Unlike the Greek or the Latin languages, each of which may be said to be representative of a single rite, it is dedicated to both the Greek and the Roman rites. Its use, however, is far better known throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> as an expression of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>; for it is used amongst the various <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> nationalities of the Byzantine Rite, whether <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or Orthodox, and in that form is spread among 115,000,000 people; but it is also used in the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> along the eastern shores of the Adriatic Sea in <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> and in the lower part of <a href="../cathen/04510a.htm">Croatia</a> among the 100,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> there. Whilst the Greek language is the norm and the original of the Byzantine or <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, its actual use as a church language is limited to a comparatively small number, reckoning by population. The liturgy and offices of the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a> were translated from the Greek into what is now Old Slavonic (or Church Slavonic) by Sts. Cyril and Methodius about the year 866 and the period immediately following. St. Cyril is credited with having invented or adapted a special alphabet which now bears his name (Cyrillic) in order to express the sounds of the Slavonic language, as spoken by the Bulgars and Moravians of his day.

<p>Later on St. Methodius translated the entire Bible into Slavonic and his disciples afterwards added other works of the Greek <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and the canon law. These two brother <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> always celebrated <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> and administered the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in the Slavonic language. News of their successful missionary work among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> was carried to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> along with complaints against them for celebrating the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> vernacular. In 868 <a href="../cathen/04592a.htm">Saints Cyril and Methodius</a> were summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a>, but arriving there after his death they were heartily received by his successor <a href="../cathen/01156a.htm">Adrian II</a>, who approved of their Slavonic version of the liturgy. St. Cyril died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 869 and is buried in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Clemente. St. Methodius was afterwards <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a> and Pannonia and returned thither to his missionary work. Later on he was again accused of using the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> Slavonic language in the celebration of the Mass and in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. It was a popular <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> then, that as there had been three languages, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, inscribed over our Lord on the cross, it would be sacrilegious to use any other language in the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. St.Methodius appealed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and in 879 he was again summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, before <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a>, who after hearing the matter sanctioned the use of the Slavonic language in the Mass and the offices of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, saying among other things: <blockquote>We rightly praise the Slavonic letters invented by Cyril in which praises to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are set forth, and we order that the glories and deeds of Christ our Lord be told in that same language. Nor is it in any wise opposed to wholesome <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in that same Slavonic language (Nec san&aelig; fidei vel doctrin&aelig; aliquid obstat missam in eadem slavonica lingua canere), or to chant the holy gospels or divine lessons from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a> and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testaments</a> duly translated and interpreted therein, or the other parts of the divine office: for He who created the three principal languages, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, also made the others for His praise and glory (Boczek, Codex, tom. I, pp. 43-44).</blockquote>

<p>From that time onward the Slavonic tongue was firmly fixed as a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and was used wherever the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> tribes were <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> under the influence of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and missionaries of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>. The Cyrillic letters used in writing it are adaptations of the uncial Greek alphabet, with the addition of a number of new letters to express sounds not found in the Greek language. All Church books in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servia</a>, <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, or Austro-Hungary (whether used in the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or the Greek Orthodox Churches) are printed in the old Cyrillic alphabet and in the ancient Slavonic tongue.

<p>But even before St. Cyril invented his alphabet for the Slavonic language there existed certain runes or native characters in which the southern dialect of the language was committed to writing. There is a tradition, alluded to by <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a>, that they were invented by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> as early as the fourth century; Jagic however thinks that they were really the original letters invented by St. Cyril and afterwards abandoned in favour of an imitation of Greek characters by his disciples and successors. This older alphabet, which still survives, is called the <a href="../cathen/06575b.htm">Glagolitic</a> (from <em>glagolati</em>, to speak, because the rude tribesmen imagined that the letters spoke to the reader and told him what to say), and was used by the southern <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> tribes and now exists along the Adriatic highlands. (See <a href="../cathen/06575b.htm">GLAGOLITIC</a>.) The Slavonic which is written in the <a href="../cathen/06575b.htm">Glagolitic</a> characters is also the ancient language, but it differs considerably from the Slavonic written in the Cyrillic letters. In fact it may be roughly compared to the difference between the Gaelic of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and the Gaelic of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. The Roman Mass was translated into this Slavonic shortly after the Greek liturgy had been translated by Sts. Cyril and Methodius, so that in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> among the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> peoples the southern Slavonic written in <a href="../cathen/06575b.htm">Glagolitic</a> letters became the language of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, while the northern Slavonic written in Cyrillic letters was the language of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>. The prevailing use of the Latin language and the adoption of the Roman alphabet by many <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> nationalities caused the use of the <a href="../cathen/06575b.htm">Glagolitic</a> to diminish and Latin to gradually take its place. The northern <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> peoples, like the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a>, Poles and Slovaks, who were converted by Latin missionaries, used the Latin in their rite from the very first. At present the <a href="../cathen/06575b.htm">Glagolitic</a> is only used in <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> and Croatia. <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> in 1631 definitively settled the use of the <a href="../cathen/06575b.htm">Glagolitic</a>-Slavonic <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">missal</a> and office-books in the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, and laid down rules where the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of each language came in contact with each other in regard to church services. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> published two editions of the Glagoltic <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, from one of which the illustration on page 45 is taken.

<p>The liturgy used in the Slavonic language, whether of Greek or <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, offers no peculiarities differing from the original Greek or Latin sources. The <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> have introduced an occasional minor modification (see <a href="../cathen/13277a.htm">RUTHENIAN RITE</a>), but the Orthodox Russians, <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a> substantially follow he Byzantine liturgy and offices in the Slavonic version. The <a href="../cathen/06575b.htm">Glagolitic</a> <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, and ritual follow closely the Roman <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a>, and the latest editions contain the new offices authorized by the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman congregations</a>. The casual observer could not distinguish the Slavonic <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> from the Latin <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> when celebrating Mass or other services, except by hearing the language as pronounced aloud.
