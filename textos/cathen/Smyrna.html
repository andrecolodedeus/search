<h1>Smyrna</h1>  

<p>LATIN ARCHDIOCESE OF SMYRNA (SMYRNENSIS), in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>.

<p>The city of Smyrna rises like an amphitheatre on the gulf which bears its name. It is the capital of the vilayet of A&iuml;din and the starting-point of several railways; it has a population of at least 300,000, of whom 150,000 are Greeks. There are also numerous <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> and almost 10,000 <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. It was founded more than 1000 years B.C. by colonists from Lesbos who had expelled the Leleges, at a place now called Bournabat, about an hour's distance from the present Smyrna. Shortly before 688 B.C. it was captured by the Ionians, under whose rule it became a very rich and powerful city (Herodotus, I, 150). About 580 B.C. it was destroyed by Alyattes, King of Lydia. Nearly 300 years afterwards Antigonus (323-301 B.C.), and then Lysimachus, undertook to rebuild it on its present site. Subsequently comprised in the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/11666a.htm">Pergamus</a>, it was ceded in 133 B.C. to the Romans. These built there a judiciary <em>conventus</em> and a mint. Smyrna had a celebrated <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of rhetoric, was one of the cities which had the title of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>, and in which the <em>concilium festivum</em> of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> was celebrated. Demolished by an earthquake in A.D. 178 and 180, it was rebuilt by <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a>. In 673 it was captured by a fleet of <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>. Under the inspiration of <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> the Latins captured it from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a> in 1344 and held it until 1402, when Tamerlane destroyed it after slaying the inhabitants. In 1424 the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> captured it and, save for a brief occupation by the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> in 1472, it has since belonged to them.

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was preached to the inhabitants at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. As early as the year 93, there existed a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community directed by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for whom St. John in the Apocalypse (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs11">1:11</a>; <a href="../bible/rev002.htm#vrs8">2:8-11</a>) has only words of praise. There are extant two letters written early in the second century from <a href="../cathen/15063c.htm">Troas</a> by <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">St. Ignatius of Antioch</a> to those of Smyrna and to <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Through these letters and those of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Smyrna to the city of <a href="../cathen/12025a.htm">Philomelium</a>, we know of two ladies of high rank who belonged to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Smyrna. There were other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the vicinity of the city and dependent on it to whom <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">St. Polycarp</a> wrote letters (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.24</a>). When <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> (23 February), the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Smyrna sent an <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">encyclical</a> concerning his death to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025a.htm">Philomelium</a> and others. The "Vita Polycarpi" attributed to <a href="../cathen/12105a.htm">St. Pionius</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Smyrna <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in 250, contains a list of the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>: Strataes; Bucolus; <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>; Papirius; Camerius; Eudaemon (250), who <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a> during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a>; Thraseas of <a href="../cathen/05604b.htm">Eumenia</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, who was buried at Smyrna. Noctos, a Modalist <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> of the second century, was a native of the city as were also Sts. Pothinus and <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus of Lyons</a>. Mention should also be made of another <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, St. Dioscorides, <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> on 21 May. Among the Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, a list of whom appears in <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a>, (Oriens Christ., I, 737-46), was Metrophanes, the great opponent of Photius, who laboured in the revision of the "Octoekos", a Greek <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical book</a>.

<p>The Latin See of Smyrna was created by <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> in 1346 and had an uninterrupted succession of titulars until the seventeenth century. This was the beginning of the Vicariate Apostolic of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, or of Smyrna, of vast extent. In 1818 <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> established the Archdiocese of Smyrna, at the same time retaining the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of which was wider. Its limits were those of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariates Apostolic</a> of Mesopotamia, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and Constantinople. The archdiocese had 17,000 Latin <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, some Greek <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a>, called Alepi, and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> under special organization. There are: 19 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>; 55 regulars; 8 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, of which 4 are in Smyrna; 14 churches with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 12 without priests; 25 primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 2500 pupils, 8 colleges or academies with 800 pupils; 2 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>; and 4 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>. The religious men in the archdiocese or the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> are <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesians of Don Bosco</a>, <a href="../cathen/02104a.htm">Assumptionists</a> (at Koniah), <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>, and Marist Brothers (at Metellin). Religious communities of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, Sisters of Charity (13 houses with more than 100 sisters), Sisters of Sion, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> of Ivr&eacute;e, <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, and Oblates of the Assumption.
