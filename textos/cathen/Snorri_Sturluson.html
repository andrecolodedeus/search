<h1>Snorri Sturluson</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">Historian</a>, born at Hvammr, 1178; died 1241. Snorri, who was the son of Sturla Thortsson (d. 1182), was the most important <a href="../cathen/07615b.htm">Icelandic</a> historian of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. In him were united the experienced statesman and the many-sided scholar. As a child he went to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Saemund the Wise at Oddi, of which, at that time, Saemund's grandson J&aacute;n Loptsson was the head. On his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> side J&aacute;n was related to the most distinguished <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of Iceland, while by his mother Thora he was connected with the royal family of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>. Under this skillful teacher Snorri was thoroughly trained in many branches of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but he learned especially the old northern <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the gods, the saga concerning Odin, and Scandinavian history. By a rich alliance Snorri obtained the money to take a leading part in politics, but his political course brought him many dangerous enemies, among whom King Haakon of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> was the most powerful, and he was finally <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> at the king's instigation. Snorri's importance rests on his literary works of which "Heimskringla" (the world) is the most important, since it is the chief authority for the early history of Iceland and Scandinavia. However, it does not contain reliable statements until the history, which extends to 1177, reaches a late period, while the descriptions of the primitive era are largely vague narrations of sagas. The Sturlunga-Saga, which shows more of the local colouring of <a href="../cathen/07615b.htm">Iceland</a>, was probably only partly the work of Snorri. On the other hand he is probably the author of the <a href="../cathen/05280a.htm">Younger Edda</a> called "Snorra-Edda", which was intended as a textbook of the art of poetry. Its first part, "Gylfaginning" relates the mythology of the North in an interesting, pictorial manner, and is a compilation of the songs of the early scalds, the songs of the common people, sagas, and probably his own poetic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>.
