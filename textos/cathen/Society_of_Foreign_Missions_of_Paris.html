<h1>Society of Foreign Missions of Paris</h1>  

<p>The Society of Foreign Missions of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> was established in 1658-63, its chief founders being Mgr Pallu, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Heliopolis, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Tongking, and Mgr Lambert de la Motte, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bertyus, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Conchin-China. Both <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> left <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (1660-62) to go to their respective missions and as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> travellers of Christ they crossed <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> and <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> on foot. The object of the new <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was and is still the evangelization of infidel countries, by founding churches and raising up a native <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. In order that the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> might recruit members and administer its <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, a house was established in 1663 by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> whom the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> had appointed their agents. This house, whose directors were to form young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to the apostolic life and transmit to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the offerings made by charity, was, and is still situated in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in the Rue de Bac. Known from the beginning as the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Foreign Missions, its secured the approval of <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>, and the legal recognition, still in force, of the French Government.

<p>The nature and organization of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> deserves special mention. It is not a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order but a congregation, a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, united as members of the same body, not by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> but by the rule approved by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, by community of object, and the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Foreign Missions, which is the centre of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and the common basis which sustains the other parts. On entering the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> the missionaries promise to devote themselves until death to the service of the missions, while the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> assures them in return, besides the means of sanctification and perseverance, all <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> temporal support and assistance. There is no superior general; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, superiors of missions and board of directors of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> are the superiors of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. The directors of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> are chosen from among the missionaries and each group of missions is represented by a director. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> are appointed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, after <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> by the missionaries, and presentation by the directors of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. In their missions they depend only on <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> and through it on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. No subject aged more than thirty-five may be admitted to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> nor may anyone become a member of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> before having spent three years in the mission field. Several points of this rule were determined from the earliest year of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society's</a> existence, and others were established by degrees and as experience pointed out their usefulness. By this rule the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> has lived and according to it its history has been outlined.

<p>This history is difficult, for owing to the length of the journeys, the infrequent communication, and the poverty of resources the missions have developed with difficulty. The chief events of the first period (1658-1700) are: the publication of the book "Institutions apostoliques", which contains the germ of the principles of the rule, the foundation of the general <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Juthia, (Siam), the evangelization of Tongking, Cochin China, Cambodia, and Siam, where more than 40,000 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, the creation of an institute of Annamite <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> known as "Lovers of the Cross", the establishment of rules among catechists, the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of thirty native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Besides these events of purely religious interest there were others in the political order which emphasized the patriotism of these evangelical labourers: through their initiative a more active trade was established between Indo-China, the Indies, and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; embassies were sent from place to place; treaties were signed; a French expedition to Siam took possession of Bangkok, Mergin, and Jonselang, and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was on the verge of possessing an Indo-Chinese empire when the blundering of subalterns ruined an undertaking the failure of which had an unfortunate influence on the missions. But the most important work of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> is the application of the fruitful principle of the organization of churches by native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Thenceforth the apostolate in its progress has has followed this plan in every part of the world with scrupulous fidelity and increasing success. In the second half of the eighteenth century it was charged with the missions which the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had possessed in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> prior to their suppression in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. Many of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> remained there. The missions thereupon assumed new life, especially at Setchoan, where remarkable <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Mgr Pottier and Mgr Dufresse, gave a strong impulse to evangelical work; and in Cochin China, where Mgr Pineau de Behaine performed signal service for the king of that country as his agent in making with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> a treaty, which was the first step towards the splendid situation of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in Indo-China. At the end of the eighteenth century the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French revolution</a> halted the growth of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, which had previously been very rapid. At that time it had six <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, a score of missionaries, assisted by 135 native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; in the various missions there were nine <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> with 250 students, and 300,000 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Each year the number of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> rose on a average of 3000 to 3500; that of infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> <em>in articulo mortis</em> was more than 100,000.

<p>In the nineteenth century the development of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and its missions was rapid and considerable. Several causes contributed to this; chiefly the charity of the Propagation of the Faith and the Society of the Holy Childhood; each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> receives annually 1200 francs, each mission has its general needs and works allowance, which varies according to its importance, and may amount to from 10,000 to 30,000 francs. The second cause was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Fifteen missionaries died in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> or were beheaded during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and the beginning of the nineteenth century; but after that the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> among the missionaries were very numerous. The best known are Mgr Dufresse, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of Se-tchoan, beheaded in 1815; Gagelin, <a href="../cathen/09642c.htm">Marchand</a>, Jaccard, Cornay, and <a href="../cathen/02686c.htm">Dumoulin-Borie</a> from 1833 to 1838; and from 1850 to 1862 Schoeffler, V&eacute;nard, <a href="../cathen/02674a.htm">Bonnard</a>, N&eacute;ron, Chapdelaine, N&eacute;el, Cuenot, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of Eastern Cochin China. If, besides these, mention were made of the native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, catechists, and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, in short of all who died for Christ, we should have a record of one of the bloodiest <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> in history. These persecutions were described in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> by books, pamphlets, annals, and journals, arousing the pity of some and the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of others, and inspiring numerous young men either with the desire or <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> or that of evangelization. They moved <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> nations, especially <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, to intervene in Indo-China and <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, and open up in these countries an era of liberty and protection till then unknown. Another cause of the progress of the missionaries was the ease and frequency of communication in consequence of the invention of steam and the opening of the Suez Canal. A voyage could be made safely in one month which formerly required eight to ten months amid many dangers.

<p>The following statistics of the missions confided to the Society will show this development at a glance: <em>Missions of <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> and Korea</em> &mdash; Tokio, <a href="../cathen/10667c.htm">Nagasaki</a>, <a href="../cathen/11333b.htm">Osaka</a>, <a href="../cathen/07116a.htm">Hakodate</a>, Korea, total number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 138,624; churches or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 238; <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and missionaries, 166; native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 48; catechists, 517; <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, 4; seminarists, 81; communities of men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, 44, containing 390 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 161, with 9024 pupils; <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> and work-rooms, 38, with 988 children; pharmacies, dispensaries, and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 19. <em>Missions of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> and Tibet</em> &mdash; Western, Eastern, and Southern Se-tchoan, Yun-nan, Kouy-tcheou, Kouang-ton, Kouang-si, Southern <a href="../cathen/09585a.htm">Manchuria</a>, Northern <a href="../cathen/09585a.htm">Manchuria</a>. &mdash; <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 272,792; churches or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 1392; <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and missionaries, 408; native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 191; catechists, 998; <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, 19; seminarists, 661; communities of men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, 23, with 222 members; <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1879, with 31,971 pupils; <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> and work-rooms, 132, with 4134 children; pharmacies, dispensaries, and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 364. <em>Missions of Eastern Indo-China</em> &mdash; Tongking, Cochin China, Cambodia &mdash; <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, 632,830; churches or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 2609; <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and missionaries, 365; native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 491; catechists, 1153; <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, 14; seminarists, 1271; communities of men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, 91, with 2538 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1859, with 58,434 pupils; <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> and work-rooms, 106, with 7217 children; pharmacies, dispensaries, and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 107. <em>Missions of Western Indo-China</em> &mdash; Siam, <a href="../cathen/09562a.htm">Malacca</a>, Laos, Southern Burma, Northern Burma &mdash; <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 132,226; churches or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 451; <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and missionaries, 199; native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 42; catechists, 242; <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, 3; seminarists, 81; communities of men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, 47, with 529 members; <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 320, with 21,306 pupils; <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> and work-rooms, 132, with 3757 children; pharmacies, dispensaries, and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 86. <em>Missions of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a></em> &mdash; Pondicherry, <a href="../cathen/10661d.htm">Mysore</a>, <a href="../cathen/04095a.htm">Coimbatore</a>, Kumbakonam. &mdash; <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 324,050; churches or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 1048; <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and missionaries, 207; native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 67; catechists, 274; <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, 4; seminarists, 80; communities of men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, 54, with 787 members; <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 315, with 18,693 pupils; <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> and work-rooms, 57, with 2046 children; pharmacies, dispensaries, and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 41.

<p>In addition to these missionaries actively engaged in mission work, there are some occupied in the establishments called common, because they are used by the whole <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Indeed the development of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> necessitated undertakings which were not needed in the past. Hence a sanatorium for sick missionaries has been established at Hong-Kong on the coast of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>; another in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> among the Nilgiri mountains, of radiant appearance and invigorating climate, and a third in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In thinking of the welfare of the body, that of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was not lost sight of, and a house of spiritual retreat was founded at Hong-Kong, wither all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> may repair to renew their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> and apostolic fervour. To this house was added a printing establishment whence issue the most beautiful works of the Far East, dictionaries, grammars, books of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>, and pedagogy. Houses of correspondence, or agencies, were established in the Far East, at Shanghai, Hong-Kong, Saigon, Singapore, and one at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The Seminary of the Foreign Missions which long had only one section, has for twenty years had two.
