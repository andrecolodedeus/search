<h1>Society of Mary (Marist Fathers)</h1>  

<p>(Initials S.M.)

<p>A religious order of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, so called on account of the special devotion they profess toward the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Foundation (1816-1836)</h2>

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a "Society of Mary" originated (1816) in <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, with a group of seminarians, who saw in the Restoration of 1815 an opportunity for religion, but the real founder was <a href="../cathen/04101a.htm">Jean-Claude-Marie Colin</a>, the most retiring of the group. He began, amid his pastoral cares, by drafting a tentative rule and founding at Cerdon, where he was <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, the Sisters of the Holy Name of Mary; Marcellin Champagnat, another of the group, established at Lavalla the <a href="../cathen/09749c.htm">Little Brothers of Mary</a>. On account of the cold attitude assumed by the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> in <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, the foundation of the missionary priests' branch could not be made till Cerdon, <a href="../cathen/04101a.htm">Colin's</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, passed from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> to that of <a href="../cathen/02415a.htm">Belley</a>. Bishop Devie of the newly restored <a href="../cathen/02415a.htm">See of Belley</a> authorized (1823) <a href="../cathen/04101a.htm">Colin</a> and a few companions to resign their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and form into a missionary band for the rural districts. Their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and success in that arduous work moved the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to entrust them also with the conduct of his <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, thus enlarging the scope of their work. However, the fact that Bishop Devie wanted a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> institute only, and that <a href="../cathen/04101a.htm">Fr. Colin</a> was averse to such a limitation, came near placing the nascent order in jeopardy when <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a>, in quest of missionaries for Oceanica, by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 29 April, 1836, approved definitively the "Priests of the Society of Mary" or Marist Fathers, as a religious institute with simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and under a superior general. The <a href="../cathen/09749c.htm">Little Brothers of Mary</a> and the Sisters of the Holy Name of Mary, commonly called Marist Brothers and Marist Sisters, were reserved for separate institutes. <a href="../cathen/04101a.htm">Father Colin</a> was elected superior general on 24 Sept., 1836, on which day occurred the first Marist profession, Blessed Pierre Chanel (q.v.), <a href="../cathen/04101a.htm">Venerable Colin</a>, and Venerable Champagnat being among the professed.
<h2 id="section2">Development (1836-1910)</h2>

<p>From its definitive organization to the present date (1910) the Society of Mary, under four superiors general &mdash; <a href="../cathen/04101a.htm">J.C.M. Colin</a> (1836-54), J. Favre (1854-85), A. Martin (1885-1905), J. C. Raffin (1905-) &mdash; has developed along the various lines of its constitutions in and out of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> it has done work in the mission field from many missionary residences established in various centres. When <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> liberty was restored to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, it also entered the field of secondary, or college <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, its methods being embodied in Montfat's "Th&eacute;orie et pratique de l'education chr&eacute;tienne" (Paris, 1880), and moreover assumed the direction of a few <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> together with professorships in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutes for higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The French houses have also supplied men for the various missions undertaken abroad by the Society of Mary.

<p>Outside of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the first field of labour offered the Marists (1836) was the Vicariate Apostolic of Western Oceanica, comprising New Zealand, the Friendly Islands, the Navigator Islands, the Gilbert and Marshall Islands, Fiji, New Caledonia, <a href="../cathen/10783a.htm">New Guinea</a>, the Solomon and Caroline Islands. Under the secular <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Dr. Pompallier, who took up his residence in <a href="../cathen/11040a.htm">New Zealand</a>, the Marists successively occupied Wallis (1837), soon converted by Fr. Bataillon; Futuna (1837), the place of Blessed Pierre Chanel's <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>; Tonga (1842), turned by Fr. Chevron into a model <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community; New Caledonia (1843), where Bishop Douarre, Pompallier's coadjutor, met untold difficulties and Brother Blaise was massacred; and, in spite of much <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> opposition, Fiji (1844) and Samoa (1845). The immense area of the vicariate, together with the presence at its head of a secular <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, soon necessitated the creation of smaller districts under Marist <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>: Central Oceanica under Bishop Bataillon (1842), Melanesia and Micronesia under Bishop Epalle (1844), New Caledonia under Bishop Douarre (1847), Wellington (New Zealand) under Bishop Viard (1848), Bishop Pompallier retaining Auckland; the Navigator Islands (1851), long administered by the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Central Oceanica; the Prefecture of Fiji (1863), etc. Of these, Melanesia and Micronesia had to be abandoned after the massacre of Bishop Epalle at Isabella Island and the sudden death of his successor, Bishop Colomb, the Solomon Islands alone reverting to the Marists in 1898. Those various missions have progressed steadily under the Marist Fathers who, beside their religious work, have largely contributed to make known the languages, fauna, and flora of the South Sea Islands (see Hervier, "Les missions Maristes en Oc&eacute;anie", Paris, 1902), and helped in their colonization (de Salinis, "Marins et Missionnaires", Paris, s. d.). The growth of <a href="../cathen/11040a.htm">New Zealand</a> has been such as to call for a regular <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, and the Marists were concentrated (1887) in the <a href="../cathen/15580a.htm">Archdiocese of Wellington</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03699a.htm">Diocese of Christchurch</a>, still governed by members of the order.

<p>In the British Isles, the Marist foundations began as early as 1850 at the request of <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a>, but have not grown beyond three colleges and five <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, the Society of Mary has taken a firmer hold. From Louisiana, whither <a href="../cathen/11208a.htm">Archbishop Odin</a> called them (1863) to take charge of a <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and college, the Marists have passed into eleven states and even branched off into Mexico, and, although continuing to minister to a number of French speaking communities, they have not limited their action there, but gradually taken up, both in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and colleges, American work, their training houses being almost entirely recruited in this country and being located in Washington.


<h2 id="section3">Present state (1910)</h2>

<p>The Society of Mary is now divided into six provinces: 2 in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 1 in the British Isles, 1 in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> 1 in <a href="../cathen/11040a.htm">New Zealand</a>, and 1 in Oceanica.

<p>The French provinces (Lyons and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>) counted at the time of the Association Act (1901) 9 institutes for the training of aspirants or of young religious, 15 missionary residences with <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 9 colleges for secondary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, with a total of 340 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 100 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, and 34 lay-brothers. The Association Act of 1901, by dissolving <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities and confiscating their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, told heavily on these establishments: the training-houses had to be transferred to foreign parts (Belgium, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>); the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> were taken from the religious; the residences were confiscated and their inmates compelled either to go into exile or to live separately in rented quarters; the colleges alone survived in part by becoming <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> establishments. To the French provinces are attached in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, an apostolic <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for the German Missions in Oceanica, and, in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, various chaplaincies and houses of retreat for the aged or the exiled fathers.

<p>The Anglo-Irish province, erected in 1889, comprises 5 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (3 in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 1 in Devonshire, and 1 in Yorkshire) and three colleges (1 in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, 1 in Dundalk, and 1 in Middlesborough) with 46 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 8 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, and 6 lay-brothers.

<p>The New Zealand province, erected in 1889, comprises, in the <a href="../cathen/15580a.htm">Archdiocese of Wellington</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03699a.htm">Diocese of Christchurch</a>, 1 novitiate-scholasticate, 1 second <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, 1 college, 20 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> among the whites, 6 missions among the Maoris and one missionary band, with 1 <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 70 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 17 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, 15 lay-brothers, ministering to a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of about 30,000.

<p>The Province of Oceanica, erected in 1898, comprises, besides a <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> house at <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a> and three missions in <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>, five vicariates (Central Oceanica with 15 stations; the Navigator Islands or Samoa with 15 stations; New Caledonia with 36 stations; Fiji with 17 stations; New Hebrides with 22 stations) and two prefectures (the Southern Solomon Islands with 8 stations and the Northern Solomon Islands with 5 stations). It counts: 5 <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, 2 prefects Apostolic, 200 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 25 lay-brothers (all Marists), assisted by 115 <a href="../cathen/09749c.htm">Little Brothers of Mary</a>, 566 native catechists, and a large number of sisters, both <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> and native, of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> Regular of Mary and of Our Lady of the Missions, founded by the Marists. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is about 41,885.

<p>The province of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, erected in 1889, comprises two training houses in <a href="../cathen/15558a.htm">Washington, District of Columbia</a>, 4 colleges (Jefferson College, Louisiana; All Hallows' College, <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a>; St. Mary's College, Maine; Marist College, Georgia), 18 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in various states, and missions in <a href="../cathen/15605a.htm">West Virginia</a> and <a href="../cathen/07627a.htm">Idaho</a>. Its membership consists of 1 <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, 105 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 75 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, and 5 lay-brothers. There are about 600 boys in the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a> and 70,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and missions. From this province has been detached (1905) the Vice-province of Mexico which counts 26 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> working in 1 college with 350 pupils and 6 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with a large number of parishioners, French, American, German, and Mexican.
<h2 id="section4">Rule</h2>

<p>According to their constitutions, approved by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 8 March, 1873, the Marists profess, besides the three simple and perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of poverty, chastity, and obedience, common to all similar institutes, a spirit of special <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to Mary</a>, absolute loyalty to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, reverence for the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the hidden life, conformably to their motto: <em>Ignoti et quasi occulti in hoc mundo</em> (see G. Goyau, "Le r&ocirc;le de l'humilit&eacute; dans la fondation d'un Ordre", Paris, 1910). The work of the order includes missions, both domestic and foreign; colleges for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth, and, in a less degree, <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> for the training of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. Its members are either <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or lay-brothers. The candidates for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> are prepared, once their classical course is over, by one year of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, two years of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, four years of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, additional opportunities being given to those especially gifted. After ten years of profession and after the age of thirty-five, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are allowed to take the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of stability, which renders them eligible for the chapters and the high offices of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. The lay-brothers after a long probation take the same <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> as the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and devote themselves to the care of temporalities. Its government is in the hands of general officers and of chapters. The general officers, whose official residence is in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, are the superior general, his four assistants, the general <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> <em>apud Sanctam Sedem,</em> all elected by the chapter general &mdash; the first for life, the others till the following chapter. The provincial and local superiors are appointed by the superior general and his counsel. The general chapters, wherein all the provinces are represented in proportion to their membership, meet regularly every seven years, and, besides electing the general officers, issue <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> for the good of the whole order. Provincial chapters are convened every three years for the purpose of electing representatives to the chapters general, auditing the finances, and ensuring the discipline of each province. As the general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> take effect only after due <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, so the provincial <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> are in vigour only when and as approved by the superior council. By <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Apostolic Brief</a> of 8 Sept., 1850, a <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of Mary for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> living in the world was canonically established and has a large membership wherever the Marists are found.
