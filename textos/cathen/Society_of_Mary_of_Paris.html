<h1>Society of Mary of Paris</h1>  

<p>This <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was founded in 1817 by Very Reverend William Joseph Chaminade at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux, France</a>. In 1839 <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> issued a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of commendation to the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> in praise of the work done by its members. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> recognized it as a religious body in 1865, and finally in 1891, after a careful examination of the special features in which the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> differed notably from other orders, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> gave canonical <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> to its constitutions. In accordance with this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Society of Mary</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> is a religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> and lay members, who make the usual simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of poverty, chastity, and obedience, to which at the time of their final profession they add the fourth <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of stability in the service of the Blessed Virgin. Its members are officially designated by the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> as Marianists, to distinguish them from the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Society of Mary</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, founded at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> in 1816.

<p>William Joseph Chaminade was born at <a href="../cathen/11668a.htm">P&eacute;rigueux</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in 1761. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, he taught in the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Mussidan until the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, which drove most of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. During this terrible period he continued the exercise of his sacred ministry in spite of the gravest dangers of arrest and death, from which, indeed, he escaped only by adopting numerous disguises and changing continually his hiding-places. At the renewal of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> in 1797, he was driven into exile at <a href="../cathen/13468c.htm">Saragossa</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where he remained for three years. It was during this period of retreat and meditation on the needs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that he matured his plans for the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> spirit of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. After his return to <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> in 1800, his first efforts resulted in the formation of two sodalities or congregations of men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> prompted them to co-operate with him in his efforts to repair the losses sustained by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. The religious influence of these sodalities was soon felt, and Father Chaminade quickly gathered around him a number of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, bound to him by no other ties than those of their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, but all eager to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> themselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> under his direction for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Their desires culminated in the foundation of the Daughters of Mary in 1816, and of the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Society of Mary</a> in 1817. The constitutions of the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Society of Mary</a> specify the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of its own members as its primary end. Its secondary end includes all works of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. However, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> specially appeals to it, and for this reason it has devoted most of its energies to the management of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of every kind.

<p>A distinctive feature of the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Society of Mary</a> is the composition of its membership, which, as stated above, consists of both <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> and lay members who make profession of the same four <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. Except the functions of the sacred ministry, which are necessarily restricted to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and a limited number of other functions which are reserved by the constitutions, some to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and some to the lay members, all members may be employed, according to their ability but without distinction of class, in the various works of the order as well as in its government. In this combination of the forces of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> the founder sought to remove the limitations of usefulness to which each category would be subject without the co-operation of the other. The general superior and his assistants resided at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> until 1860, when they removed to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where the headquarters of the order were maintained until the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1903. Since then the seat of the general administration has been at Nivelles, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. The increase and expansion of the order has been rapid. In 1908 it comprised seven provinces and one vice-province, with houses in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13438a.htm">Hawaiian Islands</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, Mexico, and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Society of Mary</a> was introduced into the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in 1849, when its first house was founded in the <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Archdiocese of Cincinnati</a>. In 1908 it had increased to 53 establishments, comprising 2 normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 4 colleges, 3 high schools, and 44 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Thirty-five of these communities belong to the Cincinnati province, with the residence of the provincial at Nazareth, Dayton, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>; the remaining eighteen form the St. Louis province, with the residence of the provincial at Chaminade College, Clayton, Missouri.
