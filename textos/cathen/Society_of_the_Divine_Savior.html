<h1>Society of the Divine Savior</h1>  

<p>Founded at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 8 Dec., 1881, by Johann Baptist Jordan (b. 1848 at Gartweil im Breisgau), elected superior general as Father Francis Mary of the Cross. The original name, Society of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Instruction, was changed some years after its foundation to the present title. The first <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> was granted in the "Decretum laudis" of 27 May 1905. The founder imposed on his congregation, in addition to the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of poverty, chastity, and obedience, a fourth of apostolic mission work. The rules and constitution are based largely on those of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. The habit is black with a black <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a>, in which four knots are tied to remind the wearer of his four <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. In tropical countries the habit is white and the <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a> is red.

<p>On 13 Dec., 1889, the newly erected Prefecture Apostolic of Assam was placed in charge of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, which has now 7 principal and 32 dependent stations, served by 13 missionaries, aided by 12 native catechists. The Fathers have published many books in the Khasi dialect, and since September, 1906, a periodical, "Ka iing Khristan". At Lochau, near Bregenz, a German college was established 15 Sept., 1893; in the same year a station was founded at Corvallis, <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, U.S.A.; in 1896 several members began work in <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>. At present (1908) missions are given in thirteen languages from the various centres. The <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">Salvatorians</a> have establishments in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a>, Galicia, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, and Columbia. The congregation numbers 400 members, 175 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the rest scholastics, <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, in 35 foundations, of which 28 are Marian Colleges and 7 mission centres.

Haus"; also in Polish), "L'amico dei fanciulli" (in German "Manna fur Kinder"; also in Polish), and the Salvatorianische Mitteilungen" (German and Polish), containing reports of the work of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Connected with the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> are a <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> for lay men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; the "Academia litteratorium", the members of which cooperate with the fathers in the advancement of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and literature; the Angel Sodality, founded 8 Dec., 1884, for children under fourteen, which has as its organ "L'amico dei fanciulli", and a membership of 40,000.
