<h1>Society of the Helpers of the Holy Souls</h1>  

<p>(<em>Auxiliatrices des Ames du Purgatoire</em>)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> founded in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 1856, with the object of assisting the Holy Souls, by [Blessed] Eug&eacute;nie Smet (in religion, Marie de la Providence), b. at <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a>, 25 March, 1825; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 7 Feb., 1871; <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Sacred Heart, at <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a>, she distinguished herself by <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> acquirements and striking traits of devotion to the Holy Souls. She went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> on 19 Jan., 1856; the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> dates its foundation from that day. On 22 Jan. [Bl.] Eug&eacute;nie obtained the permission of <a href="../cathen/13769a.htm">Archbishop Sibour</a> to establish her order in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The community Mademoiselle Smet had gathered round her took possession of No. 16, Rue de la Barouill&egrave;re, on 1 July, 1856. This is still the mother-house of the order. On 27 Dec., 1857, the foundress, with five of her first companions, pronounced her first <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>; a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> was appointed <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>, and the Rule of St. Ignatius was adopted. Besides the three usual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, they take a fourth <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to "pray, suffer, and labour for the souls in purgatory", offering up the satisfactory part of all their works of mercy, their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, as well as <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> applicable to themselves. There are two classes of religious, the choir <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> and the lay sisters; both make the same <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, follow the same rule, and enjoy the same privileges. The subjects admitted to the first probation have a postulate of three months, followed by a two-year <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>; the sisters then make their first profession and receive a crucifix, which they wear on their breast. After another year's probation (about ten years after their first <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>), they can be admitted to perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, with the usual <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>. On that day each professed religious receives a ring, a token of her eternal alliance with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.

<p>On entering the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> their family name is replaced by a name in religion. The <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> is governed by a reverend mother general, who is aided by a council of at least four assistants. Each separate <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> has a local superior. To facilitate their works of mercy among the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, the Helpers adopt a simple black costume. Their principal work of mercy is the visiting and care of the sick poor. During the time which is not occupied by their spiritual exercises, they go to the home of the poor afflicted by sickness, and bring them every relief and consolation religious devotedness can devise; rendering them the humblest services their state requires. The Helpers also undertake, according to the requirements of the place in which they are settled, numerous other works of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and charity, such as the religious instruction of children and adults, guilds for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and girls of the <a href="../cathen/08719a.htm">working</a> classes, mothers' meetings, meetings for governesses and business employ&eacute;s, free circulating <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>, <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> classes, etc. All these works are gratuitous, the rule of the order forbidding compensation for services rendered.

<p>Soon after their institution, they adopted "honorary members", "associates", and "benefactors", who enter into a union of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and sacrifice with the Helpers, and participate in the privileges enjoyed by the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Priests can become honorary members by promising to offer up the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> once a month for the prescribed intentions; and religious, by offering up a monthly Communion for the same intentions.

<p>In 1859 <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> blessed the Confraternity of Lady Associates and granted it a special <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>; on 9 June, 1873, he granted the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> the <em>Lauda</em> or first <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>, and on 25 June, 1878, the constitutions of the order were approved by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>. The first branch house was established at <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, July, 1864. In 1867 six <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> were conducted by Bishop Languillat to Shanghai; the works which they undertook were the superintendence of a congregation of <a href="../cathen/03669a.htm">Chinese Catholic</a> maidens and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>; the preparation of converts for reception into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; the direction of a native <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> and of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for the wealthier classes. The Chinese congregation, now known as <em>Pr&eacute;sentandines</em>, are trained by the Helpers. They visit the sick, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> abandoned children, and keep native <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The Helpers have established in Shanghai a high school for the Chinese, under the name of "L'Etoile du Matin". In December, 1869, a house was established in <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>. The Helpers did good work in the ambulances for the wounded of both nations during the Franco- <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> War.

<p>In 1873 the Helpers were installed in the <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Archdiocese of Westminster</a>, at 23 Queen Anne Street, Cavendish Square. They removed to Gloucester Road, Regent's Park, in 1882. From 1874 to 1880 communities were established at Cannes, <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, Tourcoing, and Montmartre. In the last twenty-five years <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> have arisen at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, and San Remo; in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a>. There is a house in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, one in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and one at San Sebastian in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. There is a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a>; another at <a href="../cathen/02376b.htm">Beaulieu</a>, Jersey. The Helpers are also at Lourdes, at Blanchelande in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, at <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a>, and at <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. When it was decided to erect a commemorative <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> on the site of the fire of the charity bazaar in the Rue Jean Goujon, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (4 May, 1897), Cardinal Richard selected the Helpers as the guardians of this sanctuary. This foundation is named Notre-Dame de la Consolation.

<p>In May, 1892, seven Helpers sailed for New York, and were heartily welcomed by <a href="../cathen/04395a.htm">Archbishop Corrigan</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> was a very small house in Seventh Avenue; there they laboured for nearly three years, when they removed to 114 East 86th Street. In 1906, they had five houses in the same neighbourhood. Children from the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> come to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> for religious instruction. The girls have sewing classes three times a week, and are allowed to take home the garments they have made. Often <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewesses</a> ask permission to join. Some <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of this work may be obtained when it is considered that over thirty-seven thousand general instructions were given to the classes during 1905. In the winter months a number of entertainments are held for the older <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> as well as for the young girls and boys, and during 1905 a course of lectures on hygiene and first aid to the injured was given. In 1903, some Helpers were sent to St. Louis, Missouri. They have now a prosperous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in Washington Boulevard. In 1905, the Sisters went to <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, where they settled in a house in Howard Street, which was destroyed in the earthquake of 1906, when they found ample scope for their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in the exercise of their double vocation, ministering to the sick and dying, while <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> unceasingly for those who had perished. They have now a new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in Golden Gate Avenue.

<p>[<em>Note:</em> The foundress, Eug&eacute;nie Smet (in religion, Mary of Providence), was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 26 May, 1957 by Pope Pius XII. Her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 7 February, the <a href="../cathen/10709a.htm">anniversary of her death</a>.]
