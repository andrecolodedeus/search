<h1>Society of the Holy Child Jesus</h1>  

<p>The Society was founded in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1840 by Mrs. Cornelia Connelly, <em>n&eacute;e</em> Peacock, a native of Philadelphia, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> who had become a convert to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> in 1835. The <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was approved in 1887 by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, and the rules and constitutions were confirmed and ratified by the same pontiff in 1893. The constitutions are founded on those of St. Ignatius. The principal object of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> is the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and instruction of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a> of all classes, whether in day-schools, boarding-schools, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, or colleges for higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The religious undertake the instruction of converts, and visiting of the sick and poor, when these works do not interfere with the primary <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of teaching; ladies may be received into houses of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> as boarders or for the purpose of making retreats. The <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> is governed by a superior general whose ordinary residence is at the mother-house, Mayfied, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and who is assisted by a provincial or <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincials</a>. America is at present the only province. The superior general is elected by a chapter consisting of representatives of the whole order and her term of office lasts six years.

<p>The first house of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was founded at Derby, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, in 1846, but the community was shortly afterwards transferred to St. Leonards-on-Sea, Sussex, at the advice of <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a>. Here the religious have since built a fine church and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The ruins of "The Old Palace", Mayfied, Sussex, with the farm adjacent were given to the Society in 1863 by Louise, Dowager Duchess of <a href="../cathen/09112a.htm">Leeds</a>, nee Caton, one of the granddaughters of <a href="../cathen/03379c.htm">Charles Carroll of Carrollton</a>. She also made over to Mrs. Connelly a farm in Towanda, Penn., and two thousand acres of land in Lycoming Co., on condition that a branch of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> should be established in America. Accordingly five sisters came over in 1862 and opened a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Towanda. This undertaking <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> unsuccessful, and the community was removed to Philadelphia, and settled in Spring Garden Street. Here they were put in charge of the academy and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in connection with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Assumption, whose <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, the Rev. C. Carter, befriended the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> in America in every possible way. In 1864 he made over to the religious the house and farm of the old <a href="../cathen/06304b.htm">Quaker</a> establishment at Sharon Hill, seven miles from the city of Philadelphia; and this became the seat of the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and of a flourishing boarding-school. The <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> now numbers in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> nine houses and many <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for all classes, and more than four thousand children are taught by the sisters in the city of Preston alone, in which city there is also a centre for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of pupil-teachers. A college for the training of teachers of secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> was opened in Cavendish Square, London, in 1896 by invitation and under the special patronage of <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a>. A house has also been founded at Oxford. A <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the order at Neuilly, Paris, shared the common fate of all <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and was closed by order of the French Government in 1904. In America the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> possesses houses in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, New York, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, <a href="../cathen/10729b.htm">Nebraska</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15724b.htm">Wyoming</a>.
