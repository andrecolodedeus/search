<h1>Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus</h1>  

<p>(PACCANARISTS).

<p>This <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was founded by two young seminarists of Saint-Sulpice who had <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, Francois-Eleonor de Tourn&eacute;ly and Prince Charles de Broglie, a son of the marshal. Their object was to form a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> similar in all respects to the order founded by <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius Loyola</a>. Their first residence was the old country house of the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, into which the community under Tourn&eacute;ly entered 8 May, 1794, numbering four members. These four were the two founders and two young officers of the army of Cond&eacute;, Xavier de Tourn&eacute;ly, brother of the superior, and Pierre-Charles Le Blanc. The victory of the French forces at Fleurus (26 June, 1794) <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> them to leave <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> just as they were joined by a recruit who was destined to play a part of great importance, Joseph Varin de Solmon, who had also been in the army of Cond&eacute;. The fugitives lived for some time at Leutershofen near Augsburg. In the church of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, on 15 Oct., 1794, they <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> themselves by a special <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Most Holy Heart of Mary, to continue the work they had begun, to offer themselves to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> and to obey him as St. Ignatius and his companions had done. When it had to leave Augsburg, the Society of the Sacred Heart numbered sixteen subjects. It wandered about for some time in Southern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and several of its members, Father Varin among them, were <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. At length, on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Tuesday, 1797, it settled in the village of Hagenbrunn, three leagues from <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. There the founder, not more than thirty years of age, died of smallpox, 9 July, 1797, and Father Varin, but twenty-eight years of age, was chosen his successor.

<p>The new superior submitted the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> for the endorsement of the exiled <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, then detained at Florence. The number of <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a> having greatly increased, a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> was opened at Prague under the protection of the Archduchess Maria Anna, and Hagenbrunn was converted into a boarding-school. This was at the close of the year 1798. Nicholas Paccanari, a native of Valsugnana, near <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, had at one time been a sergeant in the garrison of S. Angelo, had then become a merchant and, having met with financial disaster, was reduced to earn his living as a sort of guide or cicerone. Though entirely without <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, he possessed a remarkable natural gift of eloquence.

<p>At about this period Paccanari was attached to the Oratory of the Caravita, a pious association at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under the direction of Father Gravita, who had been a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>. Here Paccanari conceived a desire to re-constitute the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. He won over to his project those <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who were his associates at the Caravita: Joseph della Vedova, a doctor of the Sapienza; Halnat, of the <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Diocese of Rennes</a>, formerly a missionary in Madagascar; Epinette, of the <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Diocese of Le Mans</a>. He drew up a rule of life for them and shut himself up at Loreto in a retreat which lasted eleven months. Returning to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in May, 1797, he obtained for his project the approval of Cardinal della Somaglia, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> vicar, and on 15 August, in the Chapel of the Caravita, the founder and his three companions made the three <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of religion and the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of obedience to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a>. They adopted the habit of the original <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and settled themselves at <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>. In August, 1798, Paccanari, having been received by <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> who was then at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienna</a>, obtained from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> several privileges and a Rescript in which the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was designated "The Company of the Faith of Jesus". The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> charged him with the care of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> students who had been expelled from their <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>.

<p>Paccanari made three journeys to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to collect these young men; the third time he and his companions were arrested by the French military authorities and lodged in the Castle of S. Angelo. They remained there four months, were then expelled from the Roman Republic and retired to <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, where many of the former <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had established themselves under the protection of the duke. Father Halnat, having learned of the existence of the Sacred Heart Fathers, suggested to Paccanari the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of one foundation for the two institutes devoted to the same object. Negotiations were opened, but were interrupted by the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of Paccanari, and were resumed in 1799. The founder of the Fathers of the Faith, after a visit to <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> who heartily encouraged his project, repaired to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> numbered about a score of members, only three of them <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. It had at first been well received by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> and of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, but its leader's lukewarmness towards the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of union with the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> rendered it suspect to those religious.

<p>Fusion with the French community at Hagenbrunn therefore offered the only opportunity for its development. Conferences were inaugurated at Hagenbrunn, 9 April, 1799, and lasted nine days, Father Sineo della Torre, one of the Sacred Heart Fathers, acting as interpreter between Father Varin and Paccanari, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> neither French nor Latin. The encouragement given by <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> was accepted by the Fathers of the Sacred Heart as a command, and their already numerous congregation allowed itself to be absorbed by Paccanari's little <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. On 18 April, Paccanari, still only a <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsured</a> cleric, was received as superior-general, and the name Fathers of the Sacred Heart was changed to that of Fathers of the Faith. The general, deeming the manner of life of the Hagenbrunn Fathers too austere and too confined, shortened their hours of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, increased the time devoted to studies and recreation, and launched his subjects on the external life and the work of preaching. Having been introduced by Father Varin to the Archduchess Maria Anna, Paccanari gained an extraordinary ascendancy over that princess, through whose good offices he received <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> from the hands of the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>.



<p>At the request of his new subjects, who were already beginning to be uneasy about his tendencies, he gave out (11 Aug., 1799) a somewhat vague statement of his intentions in regard to the original <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. At last he left <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, but only after distributing his men among the different countries of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. A college was opened at <a href="../cathen/04795a.htm">Dillingen</a>, a foundation which lasted five or six years was made at <a href="../cathen/01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a>, and Fathers Rozaven and de Broglie with some scholastics set out for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where in March, 1800, they opened a boarding-school at Kensington. Paccanari himself, returning to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, established a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, then at Este.

<p>He scattered many of his religious among the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> &mdash; at that time overcrowded with wounded soldiers&mdash;in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. In the midst of his labors he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, and soon after this he received from the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, permission to have a house at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The Archduchess Maria Anna bought from the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a> the Church of St. Sylvester, with its <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and gardens, at Monte-Cavallo; and in 1801 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in person came to install the Fathers there. In the month of August, 1802, the first congregation was held; with some temporary modifications, the old constitution of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> was adopted. In 1803 and 1804 Paccanari summoned to the College of St. Sylvester the young religious of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, and the courses in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, as well as the solemn theses, of this house of studies shed great lustre upon the nascent order. At that time there were 110 religious at St. Sylvester. In the beginning of 1804, again under the archduchess's patronage, the Salviati Palace, near St. Peter's, was opened as a boarding-school for young nobles, the institution being named, after its benefactress, the "Collegio Mariano".

<p>Throughout <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, but particularly at <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, the Paccanarists gave missions with great success. In Nov., 1805, the Council of the Republic of Le Valais offered Paccanari the College of Sion, which was accepted. To Father Varin <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> had been assigned as the field of his apostolate; he returned thither in the spring of 1800 and began by preaching to the sick in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> of Bic&ecirc;tre and la Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re. It was at this time that, with <a href="../cathen/02283a.htm">Blessed Sophie Barat</a>, he established the Society of the Ladies of the Sacred Heart (21 Nov., 1800). The Fathers of the Faith rapidly increased in number; in 1801 they were able to open at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> a boarding-school, which was transferred in the following year to the old <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at <a href="../cathen/02415a.htm">Belley</a>. <a href="../cathen/08754a.htm">Lamartine</a> was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> there. Another <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was established in 1802 at <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, and then another at Roanne in 1804. These foundations aroused the suspicions both of Fouch&eacute;, the minister of police, and of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>; but Portalis and, still more, <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Cardinal Fesch</a> quieted them for a time. Missions were preached with brilliant success; at the first mission, at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, the extraordinary power which Father Enfantin exercised over the crowds was unexpectedly revealed; at the second, at <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, more than six hundred marriages were rehabilitated.

<p>Meanwhile Paccanari's administration, his taste for display, his festivals, and the premature thrusting of his subjects into publicity displeased the Fathers of the Faith. Besides, Father Rozaven, the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, who had learned in 1802 certain unsavory details of the general's private life, pursued his inquiries, and, having attained <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1803 to communicate the melancholy facts to <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>. During his absence most of his brethren in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> wrote to Father Gruber, the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, to obtain admission individually. Father Rozaven on his return to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> imitated their example, and in March, 1804, he set out for <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Only Father Charles de Broglie remained in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a>; he broke with his former friends, allied himself closely with the <em>anti-concordataire</em> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and persisted in his protestations against the act of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> as late as 1842. Father Varin, apprised of the course of events by Father Rozaven, referred the matter to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>-legate in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and on 21 June, 1804, broke with Paccanari. His <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, having become independent, remained in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> on the advice of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> and of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> himself. It flourished in that country until 1807; missions were given at <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, Niort, <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, and elsewhere; <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> were opened at Roulers (Gand), Marvejols (Mende), Bazas (<a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>), and a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at Argenti&egrave;re (Lyons). This progress alarmed Fouch&eacute;; <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> issued an order for the suppression of the congregation, which was executed in Nov., 1807; the connivance of local authorities enabled it to continue the work of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, but its missions were stopped. Many of the Fathers entered the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> ministry.

<p>In August, 1806, Father Sineo della Torre and the Fathers in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> in their turn abandoned Paccanari. In 1810 they were received as a body into the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, though only <em>in foro interno</em>, the official aggregation not taking place until 1814. Also about the year 1806 some of the Fathers of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, and Amsterdam seceded. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> having been restored at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> (31 July, 1804), many Fathers of the Collegio Mariano went there and were admitted as <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>.

<p>In July, 1807, Paccanari received positive commands from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to retire to <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>. A first canonical process was begun during the winter. Relegated to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, the general made a confession of his whole life and appeared penitent. At the end of five months he was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a> of the Holy Office. A new trial resulted, in August, 1806, in a sentence of ten years' <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. The sentence paid a tribute to the innocence and virtue of the other Fathers of the Faith; nevertheless it was the annihilation of their society. In 1809, when the French army opened the pontifical <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a>, Paccanari at first refused to go out, but eventually left and disappeared. It is uncertain whether he withdrew to <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> under an assumed name, as some have asserted, or whether, under some regrettable circumstances, he was stabbed by a domestic servant and his body thrown into the Tiber, as another tradition has it. No one knows what his end was.

<p>The Archduchess Maria Anna, who, in spite of the commands of her brother the Emperor Leopold, had at first refused to abandon Paccanari and his work, was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to submit, overcome by the miserable life which her brother allowed her to live amid the shame of their condemnation. She retired to Styria to die a holy death. She obtained permission for the last remnants of the Paccanarists to live, though without the religious habit, in the house of St. Sylvester. The Collegio Mariano was sold, and in 1814 most of the Paccanarists entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>.

<p>As for the French Fathers, the fall of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> enabled them to meet in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and deliberate as to what course they should take. Father de Cloriviere, one of the old <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and Monsignori di Gregorio and della Genga (the latter afterwards <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a>), the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> representatives, advised them to remain in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Father Varin, however, had already set out for <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> to ask the general to appoint a commissary to re-establish the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, when the commission was given to Father Cloriviere himself. Father Varin was received by him into the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> on 19 July, 1814. Nearly all the former Fathers of the Faith followed him; the rest remaining among the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>.
