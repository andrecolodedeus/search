<h1>Society of the Sisters of St. Ursula of the Blessed Virgin</h1>  

<p>Religious congregation of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> founded in 1606 at D&ouml;le (then a Spanish possession), <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, by the Venerable Anne de Xainctonge (1587-1612). Its aim is twofold: the sanctification of its members by the observance of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of religion (simple and perpetual), and the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and sanctification of their neighbours. The latter is specially attained by teaching, as well as by works of mercy, spiritual and corporal. At a time when the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of girls was more than neglected, Mademoiselle de Xainctonge, amid extraordinary trials, realized her inspired thought to do for girls what St. Ignatius had done for boys. This <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was then an unusual one. Anne de Xainctonge may be called a pioneer in the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of girls. The classes opened at D&ouml;le, on 16 June, 1606, were public, without distinction of rich or poor, and absolutely free. From D&ocirc;le, the institute spread rapidly to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. With the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> it suffered <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, but on being driven from one country, the Ursules found children and freedom of teaching in another. During the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, their houses were closed and the religious compelled to return to the world; as soon as peace was restored, however, they resumed their former life. Mother de Verse reopened the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at D&ocirc;le, and Mother Roland de Bussy (formerly of D&ocirc;le) upon the advice of Father de Clorivi&egrave;re, S.J., and with the blessing of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> (then a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> at Fontainebleau), founded a new house at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> (1814). A number of new foundations were made from <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, until, through the anti-religious <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of 1901, the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> were expelled and their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> confiscated. The mother house of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> was transferred to Haverloolez-Bruges (Belgium). Foundations were successively made: in New York, 1901, (branch house, <a href="../cathen/12509a.htm">Providence</a>, Rhode Island, 1911); Rome, 1904; Sluis (Holland), 1911. Besides in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of North America</a>, the sisters are now carrying on their work in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was formally approved by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> (1648), which was confirmed by <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> (1678). The Constitutions are those of St. Ignatius as far as they apply to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; the first draft was begun by Mother de Xainctonge aided by Father Guyon, S.J., <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the college at D&ocirc;le, but was finished only in 1623, after her death. These Constitutions were observed until the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, but when the various houses re-opened, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the different <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> modified them according to their own views. In 1898, upon request of the religious of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, the original Constitutions, revised conformably to the new regulations of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, were definitively approved by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, and their branch erected as a generalate. In 1902 the words "Of the Blessed Virgin", were added to the title to distinguish the non-cloistered daughters of Anne de Xainctonge from the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloistered</a> daughters of St. Angela.

<p>The system of teaching employed by the order is similar to that of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; the plan of studies conforms to the requirements of the Board of Education in each country.
