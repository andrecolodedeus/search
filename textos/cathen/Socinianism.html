<h1>Socinianism</h1>  

<p>The body of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> held by one of the numerous Antitrinitarian <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> to which the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> gave birth. The Socinians derive their name from two natives of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, Lelio Sozzini (1525-62) and his nephew Fausto Sozzini (1539-1604). The surname is variously given, but its Latin form, Socinus, is that currently used. It is to Fausto, or Faustus Socinus, that the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> owes its individuality, but it arose before he came into contact with it. In 1546 a <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret society</a> held meetings at <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a> in the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> to discuss, among other points, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Trinity. Among the members of this <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> were Blandrata, a well-known physician, Alciatus, Gentilis, and Lelio, or Laelius Socinus. The last-named, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, was the intimate friend of Bullinger, <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>. The object of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was the advocacy not precisely of what were afterwards known as Socinian principles, but of Antitrinitarianism. The <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalists</a>, represented by <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a>, were the real progenitors of the Antitrinitarians of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> period, but while many of the <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalists</a> ultimately became <a href="../cathen/15061b.htm">Tritheists</a>, the term Antitrinitarian means expressly one who denies the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">distinction of persons</a> in the Godhead. The Antitrinitarians are thus the later representatives of the Sabellians, Macedonians, and <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> of an earlier period. The <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret society</a> which met at <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a> was broken up, and most of its members fled to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. Laelius, indeed, seems to have lived most at <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a>, but he was the mainspring of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, which continued to hold meetings at Cracow for the discussion of religious questions. He died in 1562 and a stormy period began for the members of the party.

<p>The inevitable effect of the principles of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was soon felt, and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> made its appearance in the ranks of the Antitrinitarians--for so we must call them all indiscriminately at this time. In 1570 the Socinians separated, and, through the influence of the Antitrinitarian John Sigismund, established themselves at Racow. Meanwhile, Faustus Socinus had obtained possession of his uncle's papers and in 1579 came to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. He found the various bodies of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> divided, and he was at first refused admission because he refused to submit to a second <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. In 1574 the Socinians had issued a "Catechism of the Unitarians", in which, while much was said about the nature and perfection of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a>, silence was observed regarding those <a href="../cathen/02062e.htm">Divine attributes</a> which are mysterious. Christ was the Promised Man; He was the Mediator of Creation, i.e., of Regeneration. It was shortly after the appearance of this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> that Faustus arrived on the scene and, in spite of initial opposition, he succeeded in attaching all parties to himself and thus securing for them a degree of unity which they had not hitherto enjoyed. Once in possession of power, his action was high-handed. He had been invited to Siebenburg in order to counteract the influence of the Antitrinitarian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Francis David (1510-79). David, having refused to accept the peculiarly Socinian tenet that Christ, though not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was to be adored, was thrown into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, where he died. Budnaeus, who adhered to David's views, was degraded and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> in 1584. The old <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> was now suppressed and a new one published under the title of the "Catechism of Racow". Though drawn up by Socinus, it was not published until 1605, a year after his death; it first appeared in Polish, then in Latin in 1609.

<p>Meanwhile the Socinians had flourished; they had established colleges, they held <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, and they had a printing press whence they issued an immense amount of religious literature in support of their views; this was collected, under the title "Bibliotheca Antitrinitarianorum", by Sandius. In 1638 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> insisted on the banishment of the Socinians, who were in consequence dispersed. It is evident from the pages of Bayle that the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> was dreaded in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>; many of the princes were said to favour it secretly, and it was predicted that Socinianism would overrun <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Bayle, however, endeavours to dispel these fears by dwelling upon the vigorous measures taken to prevent its spread in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. Thus, in 1639, at the suggestion of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Ambassador, all the states of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> were advised of the probable arrival of the Socinians after their expulsion from <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>; while in 1653 very stringent decrees were passed against them. The <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> never had a great vogue in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; it was distasteful to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> who, less <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a>, perhaps, but more conservative in their views, were not prepared to go to the lengths of the Continental <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>. In 1612 we find the names of Leggatt and Wightman mentioned as condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> for denying the Divinity of Christ. Under the Commonwealth, John Biddle was prominent as an upholder of Socinian principles; Cromwell banished him to the Scilly Isles, but he returned under a writ of habeas corpus and became minister of an Independent church in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. After the Restoration, however, Biddle was cast again into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, where he died in 1662. The <a href="../cathen/15154b.htm">Unitarians</a> are frequently identified with the Socinians, but there are fundamental differences between their doctrines.
<h2>Fundamental doctrines</h2>

<p>These may be gathered from the "Catechism of Racow", mentioned above and from the writings of Socinus himself, which are collected in the "Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum". The basis was, of course, private judgment; the Socinians rejected authority and insisted on the free use of reason, but they did not reject revelation. Socinus, in his work "De Auctoritate Scripturae Sacrae", went so far as to reject all purely natural religion. Thus for him the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> was everything, but it had to be interpreted by the light of reason. Hence he and his followers thrust aside all mysteries; as the Socinian John Crell (d. 1633) says in his "De Deo et ejus Attributis", "Mysteries are indeed exalted above reason, but they do not overturn it; they by no means extinguish its light, but only perfect it". This would be quite <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> for a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, but in the mouth of Socinian it meant that only those mysteries which reason can grasp are to be accepted. Thus both in the Racovian Catechism and in Socinus's "Institutiones Religionis Christianae", only the unity, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a>, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are insisted on, since we could be convinced of these; His immensity, <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, and omnipresence are regarded as beyond human comprehension, and therefore unnecessary for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> meant for Socinus merely that Adam was free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as a fact, not that he was endowed with peculiar gifts; hence Socinus denied the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> entirely. Since, too, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was for him but trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to deny the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of justification in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sense; it was nothing but a judicial act on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. There were only two <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and, as these were held to be mere incentives to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, they had no intrinsic efficacy. Infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was of course rejected. There was no <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>; the wicked were annihilated.
<h2>Christology</h2>

<p>This point was particularly interesting, as on it the whole of Socinianism turns. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Socinians maintained, and rightly, is absolutely simple; but distinction of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is destructive of such simplicity; therefore, they concluded the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Trinity is unsound. Further, there can be no proportion between the finite and the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, hence there can be no <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, of the Deity, since that would demand some such proportion. But if, by an impossibility, there were distinction of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the Deity, no Divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> could be united to a human <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, since there can by no unity between two individualities. These arguments are of course puerile and nothing but <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> can explain the hold which such views obtained in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As against the first argument, see <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, <a href="../summa/1012.htm#article1">(<em>Summa</em> I:12:1, ad 4)</a>; for the solution of the others see <a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Petavius</a>. But the Socinians did not become <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, as did Campanus and Gentilis. The latter was one of the original <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> which held its meetings at <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>; he was beheaded at <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a> in 1566. They did not become <a href="../cathen/15061b.htm">Tritheists</a>, as Gentilis himself was supposed by some to be. Nor did they become <a href="../cathen/15154b.htm">Unitarians</a>, as might have been expected. Socinus had indeed many affinities with <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a> and Sabellius; with them he regarded the Holy Spirit as merely an operation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a power for sanctification. But his teaching concerning the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Christ differed in some respects from theirs. For Socinus, Christ was the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, but he denied His pre-existence; He was the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> as being His interpreter (interpres divinae voluntatis). The passages from St. John which present the Word as the medium of creation were explained by Socinus of regeneration only. At the same time Christ was <a href="../cathen/15448a.htm">miraculously begotten</a>: He was a perfect man, He was the appointed mediator, but He was not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, only deified man. In this sense He was to be adored; and it is here precisely that we have the dividing line between Socinianism and <a href="../cathen/15154b.htm">Unitarianism</a>, for the latter system denied the <a href="../cathen/15448a.htm">miraculous birth of Christ</a> and refused Him adoration. It must be confessed that, on their principles, the <a href="../cathen/15154b.htm">Unitarians</a> were much more <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a>.
<h2>Redemption and sacraments</h2>

<p>Socinus's views regarding the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Christ necessarily affected his teaching on the office of Christ as Redeemer, and consequently on the efficacy of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Being purely man, Christ did not work out our <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> in the sense of satisfying for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and consequently we cannot regard the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> as instruments whereby the fruits of that <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> are applied to man. Hence Socinus taught that the Passion of Christ was merely an example to us and a pledge of our forgiveness. All this teaching is <a href="../cathen/14383c.htm">syncretized</a> in the Socinian <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> regarding the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a>; it was not even commemorative of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, it was rather an act of thanksgiving for it.
<h2>The Church and socianism</h2>

<p>Needless to say, the tenets of the Socinians have been repeatedly condemned by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. As antitrinitarianists, they are opposed to the express teaching of the first six councils; their view of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Christ is in contradiction to the same councils, especially that of Chalcedon and the famous "Tome" (Ep. xxviii) of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo the Great</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, no. 143). For its peculiar views regarding the adoration of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, cf. can. ix of the fifth Ecumenical Synod (Denz., 221). It is opposed, too, to the various creeds, more especially to that of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>. It has also many affinities with the Adoptionist <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> condemned in the Plenary Council of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, in 794, and in the second letter of <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Pope Hadrian I</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (cf. Denz., 309-314). Its denial of the Atonement is in opposition to the decrees against Gotteschalk <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in 849 (cf. Denz., 319), and also to the definition of the <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensians</a> (Denz., 428; cf. also Conc. Trid., Sess. xxii., cap. i. de Sacrificio Missae, in Denz., 938). The condemned propositions of <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> (1140) might equally well stand for those of the Socinians (cf. Denz., 368 sqq.). The same must be said of the <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldensian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>: the Profession of Faith drawn up against them by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> might be taken as a summary of Socinian <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. The formal condemnation of Socinianism appeared first in the Constitution of <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>, "Cum quorundam", 1555 (Denz., 993); this was confirmed in 1603 by <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, or "Dominici gregis", but it is to be noted that both of these condemnations appeared before the publication of the "Catechism of Racow" in 1605, hence they do not adequately reflect the formal doctrines of Socinianism. At the same time it is to be remarked, that according to many, this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> itself does not reflect the doctrines really held by the leaders of the party; it was intended for the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> alone. From the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> it would appear that in 1555 and again in 1603 the Socinians held:<ul><li>that there was no Trinity, <li>that Christ was not <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">consubstantial</a> with the Father and Holy Spirit, <li>that He was not conceived of the Holy Spirit, but begotten by St. Joseph, <li>that His Death and Passion were not undergone to bring about our <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>, <li>that finally the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was not the Mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neither did she retain her virginity.</ul> It would seem from the Catechism that the Socinians of 1605 held that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was at least <a href="../cathen/15448a.htm">miraculously conceived</a>, though in what sense they held this is not clear.
