<h1>Socrates</h1>  

<p>Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> reformer of the fifth century B.C.; born at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, 469 B.C.; died there, 399 B.C. After having received the usual Athenian <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in music (which included literature), geometry, and gymnastics, he practised for a time the craft of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>, working, we are told, in his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> workshop. Admonished, as he tells us, by a divine call, he gave up his occupation in order to devote himself to the moral and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> reform of his fellow citizens. He believed himself destined to become "a sort of gadfly" to the Athenian State. He devoted himself to this mission with extraordinary <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and singleness of purpose. He never left the City of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> except on two occasions, one of which was the campaign of Potidea and Delium, and the other a public religious festival. In his work as reformer he encountered, indeed he may be said to have provoked, the opposition of the <a href="../cathen/14145c.htm">Sophists</a> and their influential friends. He was the most unconventional of teachers and the least tactful. He delighted in assuming all sorts of rough and even vulgar mannerisms, and purposely shocked the more refined sensibilities of his fellow citizens. The opposition to him culminated in formal accusations of impiety and subversion of the existing moral traditions. He met these accusations in a spirit of defiance and, instead of defending himself, provoked his opponents by a speech in presence of his judges in which he affirmed his innocence of all wrongdoing, and refused to retract or apologize for anything that he had said or done. He was condemned to drink the hemlock and, when the time came, met his fate with a calmness and dignity which have earned for him a high place among those who suffered <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> for <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> sake. He was a man of great moral earnestness, and exemplified in his own life some of the noblest moral virtues. At the same time he did not rise above the moral level of his contemporaries in every respect, and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> apologists have no difficulty in refuting the contention that he was the equal of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">Christian saints</a>. His frequent references to a "divine voice" that inspired him at critical moments in his career are, perhaps, best explained by saying that they are simply his peculiar way of speaking about the promptings of his own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. They do not necessarily imply a pathological condition of his mind, nor a <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the existence of a "familiar demon".

<p>Socrates was, above all things, a reformer. He was alarmed at the condition of affairs in Athens, a condition which he was, perhaps, right in ascribing to the <a href="../cathen/14145c.htm">Sophists</a>. They taught that there is no objective standard of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, that that is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which seems to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and that that is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> which seems to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Socrates considered that this theoretical scepticism led inevitably to moral <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a>. If that is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which seems to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, then that is good, he said, which seems to be good. Up to this time morality was taught not by principles scientifically determined, but by instances, proverbs, and apothegms. He undertook, therefore, first to determine the conditions of universally valid <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and, secondly, to found on universally valid moral principles a <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of human conduct. Self-knowledge is the starting point, because, he believed, the greatest source of the prevalent confusion was the failure to realize how little we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> about anything, in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense of the word <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. The statesman, the orator, the poet, think they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> much about <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>; for they talk about it as being noble, and praiseworthy, and beautiful, etc. But they are really <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of it until they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what it is, in other words, until they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> its definition. The definite meaning, therefore, to be attached to the maxim "know thyself" is "Realize the extent of thine own <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>".

<p>Consequently, the Socratic method of teaching included two stages, the negative and the positive. In the negative stage, Socrates, approaching his intended pupil in an attitude of assumed <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, would begin to ask a question, apparently for his own information. He would follow this by other questions, until his interlocutor would at last be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to confess <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the subject discussed. Because of the pretended deference which Socrates payed to the superior intelligence of his pupil, this stage of the method was called "Socratic Irony". In the positive stage of the method, once the pupil had acknowledged his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, Socrates would proceed to another series of questions, each of which would bring out some phase or aspect of the subject, so that when. at the end, the answers were all summed up in a general statement, that statement expressed the concept of the subject, or the definition. Knowledge through concepts, or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by definition, is the aim, therefore, of the Socratic method. The entire process was called "Hueristic", because it was a method of finding, and opposed to "Eristic", which is the method of strife, or contention. Knowledge through concepts is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, Socrates taught, and offers a firm foundation for the structure not only of theoretical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but also of moral principles, and the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of human conduct, Socrates went so far as to maintain that all right conduct depends on clear <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, that not only does a definition of a virtue aid us in acquiring that virtue, but that the definition of the virtue is the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. A man who can define <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is just, and, in general, theoretical insight into the principles of conduct is identical with moral excellence in conduct; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Contrariwise, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is vice, and no one can knowingly do wrong. These principles are, of couse only partly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Their formulation, however, at this time was of tremendous importance, because it marks the beginning of an attempt to build up on general principles a <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of human conduct.

<p>Socrates devoted little attention to questions of physics and <a href="../cathen/04405c.htm">cosmogony</a>. Indeed, he did not conceal his contempt for these questions when comparing them with questions affecting man, his nature and his destiny. He was, however, interested in the question of the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> and formulated an argument from design which was afterwards known as the "Teleological Argument" for the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>. "Whatever exists for a useful purpose must be the work of an intelligence" is the major premise of Socrates' argument, and may be said to be the major premise, explicit or implicit, of every teleological argument formulated since his time. Socrates was profoundly convinced of the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, although in his address to his judges he argues against fear of death in such a way as apparently to offer two alternatives: "Either death ends all things, or it is the beginning of a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life." His real conviction was that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> survives the body, unless, indeed, we are misled by our authorities, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and Xenophon. In the absence of primary sources &#151; Socrates, apparently, never wrote anything &#151; we are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to rely on these writers and on a few references of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> for our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what Socrates taught. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> portrayal of Socrates is idealistic; when, however, we correct it by reference to Xenophon's more practical view of Socrates' teaching, the result cannot be far from historic <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.
