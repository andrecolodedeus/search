<h1>Sodoma</h1>  

<p>(GIOVANNI ANTONIO BAZZI, or DE'BAZZI, often miscalled RAZZI, more usually known by his nickname, SODOMA).

<p><a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> and Florentine <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a> in <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, 1477; d. at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, 1549. His father, Giacono da Bazzi, was a shoemaker who had settled in <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>. The son was in 1490 apprenticed for seven years to a glass-painter from <a href="../cathen/03396a.htm">Casale</a>, named Spanzotti, and with him the young Sodoma went to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, where he came under the influence of <a href="../cathen/15440a.htm">Leonardo da Vinci</a>, although it is exceedingly <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether he ever entered his studio. He executed his first important decorative work in 1503 for a small <a href="../cathen/11244c.htm">Olivetan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> near Pienze, and, two years after, he passed on to the mother-convent of the order, known as Monte Oliveto Maggiore, to continue the work commenced by <a href="../cathen/13787a.htm">Signorelli</a>. There he not only <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> twenty-vive large frescoes, but many other smaller ones; these constitute his most notable and perhaps his greatest works. Two years later he was at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, one of a number of artists employed by <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> to decorate the Vatican. He then went to <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, and, returning to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, executed important commissions for Agostino Chigi in the Villa Farnisena. Having completed that work he returned to <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, where he spent a considerable time, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> some wonderful pictures, including his "Christ Bound to the Column". We do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> where he was between 1518 and 1525, but in the latter year he was at work at fresco decoration, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> a world-renowned panel, now in the Uffizi Gallery at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, with its almost unapproachable figure of San Sebastian; and various smaller pictures. In 1526 he was back at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> his famous frescoes in the Chapel of St. Catherine and St. Domenico, following them by other fresco works in the Palazzo Pubblico, and then by his decorations in the Chapel of San Spirito. It was these latter works which obtained honours for him from the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a>, who created him a count palatine. He then wandered to <a href="../cathen/15504b.htm">Volterra</a>, <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, and various other places, leaving behind him traces of fine artistic work, and finally returned to <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> in his old age. He was an erratic and extraordinary man. <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> gives various malicious reports about him, many of which are palpably <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>, and others probably exaggerated. There is little <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, however, that his moral character was not above reproach, and at the very least coarse and lascivious. He drew perfectly, and with great ease, his colouring is delightful, sumptuous, and at times sensuous; he was greatly influenced by <a href="../cathen/15440a.htm">Leonardo</a>, and to a certain extent by <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>, and there is a remarkable charm and poetic feeling running through all his works, while at times the beauty of the faces of his <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children is almost irresistible. His works are scattered all over <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, perhaps the greatest being those which are at or near <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> already alluded to in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, and examples of his work at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, London, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Every possible scrap of information respecting him has been gathered together in a memoir issued in 1906 by R. H. H. Cust. This is the standard book on Sodoma, and contains the very latest information concerning him. It is more important than his original statements, to form a proper judgment concerning the artist, because it contains all that <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> states, together with many important documents and new pieces of information, dealing with the life of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, and refuting many of the statements which have been made concerning him. He must be regarded as an extraordinary genius, because at times he reached the very highest of his ideals, and then at times completely failed. He must also be regarded as a man against whom many writers have thrown mud, and who now can be safely considered as a far greater man than his contemporaries regarded him, and not so <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in disposition as many were prepared to believe him to be.
