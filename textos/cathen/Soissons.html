<h1>Soissons</h1>  

<p>Diocese of Soissons (Suessionensis)</p>

<p>Includes, with the exception of two hamlets, the entire Department of Aisne. It was re-established by the concordant of 1802 as suffragan of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, but in 1821 it became suffragan of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. It consists of (1) all the ancient Diocese of Soissons, except the civil district of Compi&egrave;gne, which went to the <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Diocese of Beauvais</a>; (2) all of the Diocese of Laon, except two <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, which went to <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>; (3) that portion of Vermandois which formerly belonged to the Diocese of Noyon (see <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">BEAUVAIS</a>); (4) a few <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> which formerly belonged to <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, Meaux, <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. After a vain attempt made by the unexecuted concordant of 1817 to re-establish the See of Laon, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Soissons were authorized by <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> (13 June, 1828) to join the title of Laon to that of their own see; by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> (11 June, 1901) they were further authorized to use the title of St-Quentin, which was formerly the residence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Noyon. The territory of Soissons and Laon played an important political part under the Merovingians. After the death of <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a> (511), Soissons was the capital of one of the four kingdoms into which his states were divided. The kingdom of Soissons, which ceased to exist in 558, when Clotaire I reunited all the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> states, came into being again in 561 when the death of Clotaire led to a redivision of the territory. It finally disappeared in 613 when the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> lands were once more reunited under Clotaire II.
<h2 id="section1">The See of Soissons</h2>

<p>Concerning the traditions that make St. Sixtus and St. Sinicius the earliest apostles of Soissons as envoys of St. Peter, see <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">REIMS</a>. Sts. Crepinus and Crepinianus <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> (c. 288) are patrons of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. According to Mgr. Duchesne, the establishment of a see at Soissons dates from about 300. Among its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are: St. Divitianus (c. 310-20); St. Onesimus (c. 350-361); St. Edibius (c. 431-62); St. Principius (462-505), brother of St. Remy of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>; St. Lupus (505-35); St. Baldarinus (Baudry) (535-545), whom Clotaire I exiled for seven years to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where he served as gardener in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>; St. Ansericus or Anscher (623-52); St. Drausinus (657-76), founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Notre Dame de Soissons and of the Abbey of Rethondes; St. Adolbertus (677-85); St. Gaudinus (685-707), assassinated by <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usurers</a>; Rothadius (832-869), famous for his quarrel with <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar</a>; Riculfus (884-902), whose pastoral issued in 889 is one of the great extant treasures of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> literature of that period; St. Arnuel de Pam&eacute;le (1081-1082), elected through the efforts of Hugues e Die <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> from <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, and who was disturbed in the possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> by two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> nominated successively by Philip I; Jocelyn de Vierzy (1126-52). who aided in the victory of <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> over the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> Anticletus, and wrote an explanation of the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostle's Creed</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>; Hugues de Champfleury (1159-75), chancellor of Louis VII; Gui de Ch&acirc;teau Porcein (1245-50), who accompanied St. Louis on the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> and was killed in Palestine; Languet de Gergy (1715-30) who wrote the life of Mary Alacoque. In 1685 <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> nominated the famous <em>litt&eacute;rateur</em> Huet <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Soissons, but the strained relations existing then between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> prevented him from receiving his Briefs, and he exchanged that see for Avranches in 1689.
<h2 id="section2">The See of Laon</h2>

<p>The Diocese of Laon was evangelized at an uncertain date by St. Beatus; the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was founded in 487 by St. Remy, who cut it off from <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> and made his nephew St. Genebaldus <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Laon are: St. Chagnoaldus (c. 620-3), brother of St. Faro, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Meaux, and of St. Fara; <a href="../cathen/07357a.htm">Hincmar</a> (857-76); Adalbero Ascelin (977-1030) driven from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> (981) by the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> Louis V who accused him of undue intimacy with Emma, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Lothaire, and who was afterwards very loyal to the interests of <a href="../cathen/07515c.htm">Hugh Capet</a>, to whom he handed over the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> Charles of Lorraine, and Arnoul, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>. He was the author of a satirical poem addressed to King Robert; Gaudri (1106-12), who held out against the commune movement, and who was slain in a brawl at Laon; Barth&eacute;lemy, de Vir, or de Viry (1113-51), who attracted St. Norbert to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; Gautier de Mortagne (1155-74), author of six small <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> treatises; Robert le Cocq (1352-8), who in October, 1356, and March, 1357, after the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of John II by the English held an important position in the States General, took the side of Stephen Marcel, conspired with him and Charles the Bad, King of Navarre, against the dauphin, the future Charles V and then fled to <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, where he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Calahorra; Pierre de Montaigut (1371-86), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1383; the historian Jean Juvenel des Ursins (1444-9), afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>; Louis de Bourbon Vend&ocirc;me (1510-52), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1517; C&eacute;sar d'Est&eacute;es (1653-1681), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1672, was elected to the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was involved in the difficulties between <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> and <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a>, <a href="../cathen/01295a.htm">Alexander VIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a>; Jean de Rochechouart de Foudoas (1741-77), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1761. Louis S&eacute;guier, nominated by Henry IV, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Laon in 1598, refused the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> to make room for his young nephew <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">Peter de B&eacute;rulle</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and founder of the <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a>; <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">de B&eacute;rulle</a> refused the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>.



<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Soissons as senior suffragan of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> had the privilege during a vacancy of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> to replace the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of anointing a King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Laon ranked as Duke and peer from the twelfth century. As second <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> peer, he had the privilege of holding the <em><a href="../cathen/01439c.htm">ampulla</a></em> during the anointing of the king. The chapter of Laon was one of the most illustrious of the kingdom. From the twelfth century its members numbered eighty-four; it had to engage in bitter struggles with the communal regime; three <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a>, sixteen <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and more than fifty <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> belonged to it. Jacques Pantal&eacute;on who became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> was a choir boy, then canon of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Laon. He arranged the <em>cartularium</em> of the church of Laon, and was commissioned by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> to settle the dispute between the chapter and Enguerrand de Coucy. As <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of Laon he assisted in 1245, at the council of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. Under the direction of <a href="../cathen/01550b.htm">St. Anselm of Laon</a>, appointed by <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugene III</a> to restore <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in connexion with Laon <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> drew young men from all parts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>.

<p>The Abbey of St-M&eacute;dard at Soissons, founded in 557 by Clotaire I to receive the body of St. M&eacute;dard, was looked upon as the chief <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; it held more than two hundred and twenty fiefs. Hilduin, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> (822-30) in 826 obtained from <a href="../cathen/05598b.htm">Eugene II</a> <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Sebastian and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>; he caused the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/06621a.htm">St. Godard</a> and St. Remi to be transferred to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>; he rebuilt the church which was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 27 August, 841, in the presence of Charles the Bald and seventy-two <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. The king bore the body of St. M&eacute;dard into the new basilica. The church was pulled down but rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1131 by <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a>, who granted those visiting the church <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> known as "St. M&eacute;dard's pardons". In this <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> Louis the Pious was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in 833, and there he underwent a public penance. Among the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of St. M&eacute;dard's are: St. Arnoul, who in 1081 became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Soissons; St. Gerard (close of the eleventh century); Cardinal de Bernis, made <a href="../cathen/04155b.htm">commendatory abbot</a> of St. M&eacute;dard in 1756. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Note Dame de Soissons was founded in 660 by Ebroin and his wife Leutrude. The <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> abbey of Longpont, founded in 1131, counted among its <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> Pierre Cantor, who died in 1197, and <a href="../cathen/10543b.htm">Blessed John de Montmirail</a> (1167-1217), who abandoned the court of Phillipe-Auguste in order to become a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. The abbey of St. Vincent at Laon was founded in 580 by Queen Brunehaut. Among its earlier <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were: St. Gobain, who, through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of solitude, retired to a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> place near Oise and was slain there; St. Chagnoaldus, afterward <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Laon, who wished to die in his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>; St. Humbert, first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of Maroilles in Hainaut. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> adopted the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">rule of St. Benedict</a>. It was reformed in 961 by Blessed Malcaleine, a Scotchman, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of St. Michael at Thierache, and in 1643 by the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of St. Maur. Among the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of St. Vincent were: St. Gerard (close of the eleventh century), who wrote the history of St. Adelard, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of Corde; Jean de Nouelles (d. 1396), who wrote a history of the world, and began the cartulary of his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The Abbey of St. John at Laon was founded in 650 by St. Salaberga, who built seven churches there; she was its first <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>; St. Austruda (d. 688) succeeded her. In 1128 the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> became a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The Abbey of Nogent sous Coucy was founded in 1076 by Alb&eacute;ric, Lord of Coucy. Among its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> were St. Geoffroy (end of the eleventh century) and the historian Guibert de Nogent, who died in 1112, and whose autobiography, "De Vita Sua" is one of the most interesting documents of the century. Under the title "Gesta Die per Francos" he wrote an account of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section1">First Crusade</a>. The Abbey of Cuissy in the Diocese of Laon was founded in 1116 by Blessed Lucas de Roucy, dean of Laon, and followed the rule of <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>. In the Diocese of Soissons, the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a> had the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>: Chartreuve, Valsery, St. Yved de Braine, Villers Cotterets, Val Secret, Vauchr&eacute;tien, Lieurestaur&eacute;. (See <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">ABBEY OF PREMONTR&Eacute;</a>.)

<p>The portion of the ancient Diocese of Noyon within the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the present Diocese of Soissons includes the town, St-Quentin (Augusta Vermanduorum) where St-Quentin was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>. It was the chief town of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> until 532, when St. M&eacute;dard, the titular, removed the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to Noyon. Abbott Fulrade built the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of St-Quentin in the eighth century and Pope Stephan II blessed it (816). From the time of <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a> until 771, and again from 844 the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of St-Quentin were <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> and counts of Vermandois. During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> a distinct type of <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">religious architecture</a> sprang up in Soissons; Eug&eacute;ne Lef&egrave;vre Pontalis has recently brought out a work dealing with its artistic affiliations. After investigation Canon Bauxin concludes that the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Laon, as it exists, is not the one <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1114 and visited by <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> in 1132; that was the restored ancient Romanesque building; the present one was built 1150-1225. Louyis d'Outremer (936), Robert the Pious (996), Philip I (1959) were anointed in Notre Dame de Laon; in the twelfth century Hermann, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Martin's of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, wrote a volume on the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of Notre Dame of Laon.
