<h1>Solari</h1>  

<p>(SOLARIO)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> artists, closely connected with the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and with the Certosa near Pavia.
<h2 id="section1">Guiniforte Solari</h2>

<p>Born 1429; died 1481. He was the son of Giovanni (born c. 1400; died 1480), superintendent of the building of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and of the Certosa. Guiniforte was one of the architects of the Certosa (1465), was employed on the Ospedale Maggiore, and was also one of the architects of the fortified castle of the Sforza <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and of several of the churches of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. His son PIETRO ANTONIO (d. 1493) worked also for a time on the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; there is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that in 1476 he was still there. Later he was called to <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> where he was employed on the rebuilding of the Kremlin.
<h2 id="section2">Andrea Solari</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">Painter</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> about 1465; d. 1515. From 1490 he was a pupil of Giovanni Bellini at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and his early works recall this <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, as for example a Madonna with Saints, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in 1495 for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Pietro at Murano and now in the Brera at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. After his return to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> he copied the style of <a href="../cathen/15440a.htm">Leonardo da Vinci</a> so closely that he was considered the latter's best pupil. He is very like <a href="../cathen/15440a.htm">Leonardo</a>, especially in the treatment of the heads, plastic modelling, and colouring. A beautiful Descent from the Cross, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in 1503, is still in existence. About this <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> he also <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> many portraits and in this way came into connexion with Cardinal Charles d'Amboise, for whom he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> a number of pictures during the years 1507-9 at Gaillon in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>. These works are now in galleries in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. During the second half of his working period he changed his style to a brighter tone and his works are easily recognized by the clear, luminous colours and the manner in which they flow into and blend with one another. The School of <a href="../cathen/15440a.htm">Leonardo</a>, however, is always perceptible. Among other <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> belonging to this time is a Madonna with a Child lying on a cushion to whom she offers the breast; the figures are surrounded by a beautiful landscape. This picture is in the Louvre and the same gallery has another of his works, a Salome receiving from the executioner the head of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>, with the delicate face turned away from the object. The Poldi-Pezzoli Gallery of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> contains a large number of his works; among these are: "Repose on the Flight to Egypt" (1515), one of the best pictures of <a href="../cathen/15440a.htm">Leonardo's</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; "St. Catherine"; "St. Anthony", "The Crowning with Thorns". His last and most important work is the "Assumption of the Blessed Virgin", at the Certosa near <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, which, however, he was not able to complete.
<h2 id="section3">Andrea's brother Cristoforo Solari (called "il Gobbo")</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">Sculptor</a> and architect, b. at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> before 1475; d. in 1527. In 1490 he went with Andrea to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> where some <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> executed by him are still in existence. In 1498 he returned to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and entered the service of Ludovico Sforza at whose order he executed his chief work, the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Ludovico's wife. The figures of Beatrice d'Este and Ludovico upon the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> belong in their massive severity, individuality of treatment, and technical excellencies to the best works of the early <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. The monument was erected in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Maria delle Grazie, but was unfortunately destroyed at a later era; in 1821 the two <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> were taken to the Certosa near Pavia. Besides there, a number of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> are ascribed to him: four <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the church, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a>, Sebastian, Christ bound to the pillar. They are marked by a less vigorous <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">naturalism</a>, the influence of a stay at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whither he went after the overthrow of the Sforza <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. From 1503 he was again in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, where he took charge of the construction of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. He also designed the great <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> della Passione at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>.
<h2 id="section4">Antonio Solari</h2>

<p>Born in 1382; died 1445. He is called IL ZINGARO (the gypsy), a nickname probably given him either because his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> was apparently a <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> blacksmith who had <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, or from the wandering life he himself led until he settled permanently in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. He is said to have worked at his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> trade until his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the beautiful daughter of an artist led him to turn to art. As at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> he was very soon able to win the favour of Queen Joanna, it was not long before he became the most important <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> of the capital. He founded a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> which produced a number of masters of moderate ability. His most important work, which is also the best production of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> at that period, is a series of twenty frescoes in the court of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> near San Severino which show traces of the influence of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>. They represent the life of St. Benedict and contain a large number of lifelike figures in dignified and graceful positions. His "Carrying of the Cross" in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Domenico Maggiore and a "Madonna" in the museum at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> show nobility of conception combined with a vigorous realism.
<h2 id="section5">Santino Solari</h2>

<p>Architect and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/04183a.htm">Como</a>, Upper <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; d. 1646. He is best known for his share in the construction of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>; he ornamented the palace and the gardens of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> with <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>.
