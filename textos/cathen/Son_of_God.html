<h1>Son of God</h1>  

<h2>In the Old Testament</h2>

<p>The title "son of God" is frequent in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. The word "son" was employed among the <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semites</a> to signify not only filiation, but other close connexion or intimate relationship. Thus, "a son of strength" was a hero, a warrior, "son of wickedness" a wicked man, "sons of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>" wild beasts, "son of possession" a possessor, "son of pledging" a hostage, "son of lightning" a swift bird, "son of death" one doomed to death, "son of a bow" an arrow, "son of <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>" a wicked man, "sons of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>" disciples of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> etc. The title "son of God" was applied in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> having any special relationship with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angels</a>, just and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> men, the descendants of Seth, were called "sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/job001.htm#vrs6">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="../bible/job002.htm#vrs1">2:1</a>; <a href="../bible/psa088.htm#vrs7">Psalm 88:7</a>; <a href="../bible/wis002.htm#vrs13">Wisdom 2:13</a>; etc.). In a similar manner it was given to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> (<a href="../bible/deu014.htm#vrs50">Deuteronomy 14:50</a>); and of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, as a nation, we read: "And thou shalt say to him: Thus saith the Lord: <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> is my son, my <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a>. I have said to thee: Let my son go, that he may serve me" (<a href="../bible/exo004.htm#vrs22">Exodus 4:22 sq.</a>).

<p>The leaders of the people, kings, princes, judges, as holding authority from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, were called sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The theocratic king as lieutenant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and especially when he was providentially selected to be a type of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> with the title "Son of God". But the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, the Chosen One, the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">Elect</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was <em>par excellence</em> called the Son of God (Ps. ii, 7). Even Wellhausen admits that <a href="../bible/psa002.htm">Psalm 2</a> is <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> (see Hast., Dict. the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>", IV, 571). The prophecies regarding the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> became clearer as time went on, and the result is ably summed up by Sanday (<em>ibid.</em>): "The Scriptures of which we have been speaking mark so many different contributions to the total result, but the result, when it is attained, has the completeness of an organic whole. A Figure was created &#151; projected as it were upon the clouds--which was invested with all the attributes of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. And the minds of men were turned toward it in an attitude of expectation. It makes no matter that the lines of the Figure are drawn from different originals. They meet at last in a single portraiture. And we should never have known how perfectly they meet if we had not the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> picture to compare with that of the New Testament. The most literal fulfilment of prediction could not be more conclusive <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that all the course of the world and all the threads of history are in one guiding Hand." The <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> besides being the Son of God was to be called Emmanuel (<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with us) Wonderful, Counsellor, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Mighty</a>, the Father of the world to come, Prince of Peace (<a href="../bible/isa008.htm#vrs8">Isaiah 8:8-9</a>) (see <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">MESSIAS</a>).
<h2>In the New Testament</h2>

<p>The title "the Son of God" is frequently applied to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> in the Gospels and Epistles. In the latter it is everywhere employed as a short formula for expressing His Divinity (Sanday); and this usage throws light on the meaning to be attached to it in many passages of the Gospels. The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> announced: "He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the most High... the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God" (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs32">Luke 1:32, 35</a>). Nathaniel, at his first meeting, called Him the Son of God (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs49">John 1:49</a>). The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> called Him by the same name, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> ironically, and the Apostles after He quelled the storm. In all these cases its meaning was equivalent to the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, at least. But much more is implied in the confession of St. Peter, the testimony of the Father, and the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.
<h3>Confession of St. Peter</h3>

<p>We read in <a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs15">Matthew 16:15-16</a>: "Simon Peter answered and said: Thou art Christ, the Son of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">living God</a>. And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, said to him: Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona: because flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." The parallel passages have: "Thou art the Christ" (<a href="../bible/mar008.htm#vrs29">Mark 8:29</a>), "The Christ of God" (<a href="../bible/luk009.htm#vrs20">Luke 9:20</a>). There can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that St. Matthew gives the original form of the expression, and that St. Mark and St. Luke in giving "the Christ" (the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>), instead, used it in the sense in which they understood it when they wrote, viz. as equivalent to "the incarnate Son of God" (see Rose, VI). Sanday, writing of St. Peter's confession, says: "the context clearly proves that Matthew had before him some further tradition, possibly that of the Logia, but in any case a tradition that has the look of being original" (Hastings, "Dict. of the Bible"). As Rose well points out, in the minds of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> because He was the Son of God, and not the Son of God because He was the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>.
<h3>Testimony of the Father</h3>



<p>(1) <em>At the Baptism</em>. "And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, forthwith came out of the water: and lo, the heavens were opened to him: and he saw the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> descending as a dove, and coming upon him. And behold a voice from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased" (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#vrs16">Matthew 3:16, 17</a>). "And there came a voice from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased" (<a href="../bible/mar001.htm#vrs11">Mark 1:11</a>; <a href="../bible/luk003.htm#vrs22">Luke 3:22</a>).

<p>(2) <em>At the Transfiguration</em>. "And lo, a voice out of the cloud saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: hear ye him" (<a href="../bible/mat017.htm#vrs5">Matthew 17:5</a>; <a href="../bible/mar009.htm#vrs6">Mark 9:6</a>; <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#vrs35">Luke 9:35</a>). Though Rose admits that the words spoken at the Baptism need not necessarily mean more than what was suggested by the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, viz. Son of God is equal to the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, still, as the same words were used on both occasions, It is likely they had the same meaning in both cases. The Transfiguration took place within a week after St. Peter's Confession. And the words were used in the meaning in which the three disciples would then understand them; and at the Baptism it is probable that only Christ, and perhaps the <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">Baptist</a>, heard them, so that it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to interpret them according to the current opinions of the crowd. Even so cautious a critic a the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> Professor Sanday writes on thee passage: "And if, on the occasions in question, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> did intimate prophetically to chosen witnesses, more or fewer, a revelation couched partly in the language of the ancient Scriptures, it would by no means follow that the meaning of the revelation was limited to the meaning of the older Scriptures. On the contrary, it would be likely enough that the old words would be charged with new meaning--that, indeed the revelation...would yet be in substance a new revelation.... And we may assume that to His (<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a>) mind the announcement 'Thou art my Son?' meant not only all that it ever meant to the most enlightened seers of the past, but, yet more, all that the response of His own heart told Him that it meant in the present.... But it is possible, and we should be justified in supposing--not by way of dogmatic assertion but by way of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>--in view of the later history and the progress of subsequent revelation, that the words were intended to suggest a new <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, not hitherto made known, viz. that the Son was Son not only in the sense of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> King, or of an Ideal People, but that the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of sonship was fulfilled in Him in a way yet more mysterious and yet more essential; in other words, that He was Son, not merely in prophetic revelation, but in actual transcendent fact before the foundation of the world" (Hastings, "Dict. of the Bible").
<h3>Testimony of Jesus Christ</h3>

<p>(1) <em>The <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptics</a></em>. The key to this is contained in His words, after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>: "I <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascend</a> to my Father and to your Father" (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs17">John 20:17</a>). He always spoke of MY Father, never of OUR Father. He said to the disciples: "Thus then shall YOU pray: Our Father", etc. He everywhere draws the clearest possible distinction between the way in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was His Father and in which He was the Father of all creatures. His expressions clearly prove that He claimed to be of the same nature with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and His claims to Divine Sonship are contained very clearly in the Synoptic Gospels, though not as frequently as in St. John.

<p>"Did you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that I must be about my father's business" (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#vrs49">Luke 2:49</a>); "Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>: but he that doth the will of my Father who is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, he shall enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. Many will say to me in that day: Lord, Lord, have not we prophesied in thy name, and <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">cast out devils</a> in thy name, and done many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in thy name? And then will I profess unto them, I never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> you: depart from me you, that work iniquity" (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#vrs21">Matthew 7:21-23</a>). "Everyone therefore that shall confess me before men, I will also confess him before my Father who is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs32">Matthew 10:32</a>). "At that time <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered and said: I confess to thee, O Father, Lord of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to little ones. Yea, Father; for so hath it seemed good in thy sight. All things are delivered to me by my Father. And no one knoweth the Son, but the Father: neither doth any one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Father, but the Son, and he to whom it shall please the Son to reveal HIM. Come to me, all you that labour, and are burdened, and I will refresh you" (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs25">Matthew 11:25-30</a>; <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#vrs21">Luke 10:21, 22</a>). In the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the wicked husbandmen the son is distinguished from all other messengers: "Therefore having yet one son, most dear to him; he also sent him unto them last of all, saying: They will reverence my son. But the husbandmen said one to another: This is the heir; come let us kill him" (<a href="../bible/mar012.htm#vrs6">Mark 12:6</a>). Compare <a href="../bible/mat022.htm#vrs2">Matthew 22:2</a>, "The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is likened to a king, who made a marriage for his son." In <a href="../bible/mat017.htm#vrs25">Matthew 17:25</a>, He states that as Son of God He is free from the temple tax. "David therefore himself calleth him Lord, and whence is he then his son?" (<a href="../bible/mar012.htm#vrs37">Mark 12:37</a>). He is Lord of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. He shall come "in the clouds of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> with much power and majesty. And he shall send his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#vrs30">Matthew 24:30, 31</a>). He confessed before <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiphas</a> that he was the Son of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">blessed God</a> (<a href="../bible/mar014.htm#vrs61">Mark 14:61-2</a>). "Going therefore, teach ye all nations, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost... and behold I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world" (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs19">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>).

<p>The claims of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> Christ, as set forth in the Synoptic Gospels, are so great that Salmon is justified in writing (Introd. to New Test., p. 197): "We deny that they [<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> utterances in the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a>] are at all inconsistent with what is attributed to Him in the Synoptic Gospels. On the contrary, the dignity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour's</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of adhering to Him, are as strongly stated in the discourses which St. Matthew puts into His mouth as in any later Gospel.... The Synoptic <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> all agree in representing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> as persisting in this claim [of Supreme Judge] to the end, and finally incurring condemnation for <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Jewish Council</a>.... It follows that the claims which the Synoptic Gospels represent our Lord a making for Himself are so high...that, if we accept the Synoptic Gospels as truly representing the character of our Lord's language about Himself, we certainly have no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to reject St. John's account, on the score that he puts too exalted language about Himself into the mouth of our Lord."

<p>(2) <em>St. John's Gospel</em>. It will not be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to give more than a few passages from St. John's Gospel. "My Father worketh until now; and I work.... For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things which he himself doth: and greater works than these will he shew him, that you may wonder. For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and giveth life: so the Son also giveth life to whom he will. For neither doth the Father judge any man, but hath given all judgment to the Son. That all may <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Son, as they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Father" (v, 17, 20-23). "And this is the will of my Father that sent me: that everyone who seeth the Son, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> in him, may have life everlasting, and I will raise him up in the last day" (vi, 40). "Father, the hour is come, glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee.... And now glorify thou me, O Father, with thyself, with the glory which I had, before the world was, with thee" (xvi, 1, 5).

<p>(3) <em>St. Paul</em>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> in the Epistles, which were written much earlier than most of our Gospels, clearly teaches the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and that He was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son of God; and it is important to remember that his enemies the <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaizers</a> never dared to attack this teaching, a fact which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proves</a> that they could not find the smallest semblance of a discrepancy between his doctrines on this point and that of the other Apostles.
