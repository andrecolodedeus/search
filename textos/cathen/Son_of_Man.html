<h1>Son of Man</h1>  

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> "son of man" is always translated in the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> without the article as <em>anthropou</em>.
<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>It is employed as a poetical synonym for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or for the ideal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, e.g. "God is not as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that he should <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> nor as a son of man, that he should be changed" (<a href="../bible/num023.htm#vrs19">Numbers 23:19</a>). "Blessed is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that doth this and the son of man that shall lay hold on this" (<a href="../bible/isa056.htm#vrs2">Isaiah 56:2</a>). "Let thy hand be upon the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of thy right hand: and upon the son of man whom thou hast confirmed for thyself" (<a href="../bible/psa079.htm#vrs18">Psalm 79:18</a>).
<h2 id="section2">II</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05737b.htm">Prophet Ezechiel</a> is addressed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as "son of man" more than ninety times, e.g. "Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak to thee" (<a href="../bible/eze002.htm#vrs1">Ezekiel 2:1</a>). This usage is confined to <a href="../cathen/05737b.htm">Ezechiel</a> except one passage in <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, where <a href="../cathen/06330a.htm">Gabriel</a> said: "Understand, O son of man, for in the time of the end the vision shall be fulfilled" (<a href="../bible/dan008.htm#vrs17">Daniel 8:17</a>).
<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>In the great <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> of <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> after the appearance of the four beasts, we read:

<blockquote><p>"I beheld therefore in the vision of the night, and lo, one like a son of man came with the clouds of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and he came even to the <a href="../cathen/01463a.htm">Ancient of days</a>: and they presented him before him. And he gave him power, and glory, and a kingdom: and all peoples, tribes, and tongues shall serve him: his power is an everlasting power that shall not be taken away: and his kingdom shall not be destroyed" (7:13 sq.).</p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who appears here as son of man is interpreted by many non-Catholics as representing the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Messianic kingdom</a>, but there is no thing to prevent the passage from being taken to represent not only the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Messianic kingdom</a>, but <em>par excellence</em> the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> king. In the explanation, verse 17, the four beasts are "four kings" R.V., not "four kingdoms" as translated by <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">D.V.</a>, though they appear to signify four kingdoms as well for the characteristics of oriental kingdoms were identified with the characters of their kings. So when it is said in verse 18: "But the saints of the most high God shall take the kingdom: and they shall possess the kingdom for ever and ever", the king is no more excluded here than in the case of the four beasts. The "son of man" here was early interpreted of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/01602a.htm">Book of Henoch</a>, where the expression is used almost as a <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> title, though there is a good deal in Drummond's argument that even here it was not used as a <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> title notwithstanding the fact that it was understood of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>. It has to be added that in the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> it was not very widely, if at all, known as a <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> title.

<p>The employment of the expression in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> is very remarkable. It is used to designate <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> no fewer than eighty-one times &#151; thirty times in <a href="../cathen/10057a.htm">St. Matthew</a>, fourteen times in <a href="../cathen/09674b.htm">St. Mark</a>, twenty-five times in <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">St. Luke</a>, and twelve times in <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">St. John</a>. Contrary to what obtains in the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>, it appears everywhere with the article, as <em>ho huios tou anthropou</em>. Greek scholars are agreed that the correct translation of this is "the son of man", not "the son of <em>the</em> man". The possible ambiguity may be one of the reasons why it is seldom or never found in the early Greek <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> as a title for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But the most remarkable thing connected with "the Son of Man" is that it is found only in the mouth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. It is never employed by the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> or <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>, nor by the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">early Christian writers</a>. It is found once only in <a href="../cathen/01117a.htm">Acts</a>, where <a href="../cathen/14286b.htm">St. Stephen</a> exclaims: "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (7:55). The whole incident proves that it was a well-known expression of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a>. Though the saying was so frequently employed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> preferred some more honorific title and we do not find it at all in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> nor in the other <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> perhaps uses something like an equivalent when he calls <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the second or last <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>. The writers of the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a>, moreover, probably wished to avoid the Greek ambiguity just alluded to.

<p>The expression is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a>, in spite of the futile attempts of some German <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalists</a> and others to show that He could not have used it. It was not invented by the writers of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> to whom it did not appear to be a favourite title, as they never use it of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> themselves. It was not derived by them from what is asserted was a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> interpretation of <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, because it appears in the early portions of the public ministry where there is no reference to <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>. The objection that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could not have used it in Aramaic because the only similar expression was <em>bar-nasha</em>, which then meant only <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">"man"</a> &#151; <em>bar</em> having by that time lost its meaning of "son" &#151; is not of much weight. Only little is known of the Aramaic spoken in Palestine in the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and as Drummond points out special meaning could be given to the word by the emphasis with which it was pronounced, even if <em>bar-nasha</em> had lost its primary meaning in Palestine, which is not at all <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. As the same writer shows, there were other expressions in Aramaic which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could have employed for the purpose, and Sanday suggests that He may have occasionally spoken in Greek.

<p>The early <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> were of the opinion that the expression was used out of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and to show <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and this is very probable considering the early rise of <a href="../cathen/05070c.htm">Docetism</a>. This is also the opinion of <a href="../cathen/04377a.htm">Cornelius a Lapide</a>. Others, such as Knabenbauer, think that He adopted a title which would not give umbrage to His enemies, and which, as time went on, was capable of being applied so as to cover His <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> claims &#151; to include everything that had been foretold of the representative <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the second <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, the suffering servant of <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Jehovah</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> king.
