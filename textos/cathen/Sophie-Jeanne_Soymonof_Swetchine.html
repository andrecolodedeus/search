<h1>Sophie-Jeanne Soymonof Swetchine</h1>  

<p>Writer, b. at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, 22 Nov., 1782; d. in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 10 Sept., 1857. She was a member of a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and became associated with French literature through her correspondence and other writings. Impressed by her precocious intelligence, her father gave her a very careful <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in everything except religion, which he ignored. At fourteen she was appointed maid of honor to the empress. At seventeen she was married to General Swetchine who was forty-two. By birth she belonged to the Greek, or <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, but from the time that her trials, her reading, and her own reflections had made her a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, she felt the necessity of following to the end of the path which was leading her to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and she <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, despite the anguish of her heart. "My Faith," she said afterwards, "is to me what Benjamin was to Rachel, the child of my sorrow." At the time of her <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> she was thirty-three years old. She had already left the court, her husband having been disgraced, with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, as the result of a plot of which he was the victim. Thenceforth she had to leave even her country, since as an avowed <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> she could not remain at St. Petersburg. With her husband she went to reside at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> at the beginning of the Restoration. She had been preceded by a letter from <a href="../cathen/09554a.htm">Joseph de Maistre</a>, who wrote to Bonald: "In a short time you will see at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> a Russian lady whom I especially commend to you. Never will you see such moral strength, wit, and learning joined to such <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>." In her <em>salon</em> in the Rue Saint Dominique, open from three to six, and from nine to midnight, she saw all the most distinguished men of the period: <a href="../cathen/03640a.htm">Chateaubriand</a>, Bonals, Cuvier, Cousin, Donoso Cortoes, and among her intimates were <a href="../cathen/04078b.htm">Augustin Cochin</a>, <a href="../cathen/14753a.htm">Tocqueville</a>, Falloux, who wrote her biography, <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a>, who were like her spiritual sons. Her influence was incontestable. She died as a devout <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> in 1857 at the age of seventy-five.

<p>She was remarkable more for the beauty of her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> than that of her countenance. Her <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> was lofty, quick, and penetrating. She read a great deal, and always with her pen in hand. She was <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> to the verge of <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>, and although constantly ill &mdash; for she was one of those who never pass a day without suffering &mdash; she was resigned to the will of Providence. While kind to all she was an incomparable friend. True modesty prevented her from publishing anything, but at her death she left enough to fill many volumes. De Falloux collected extracts from her <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> which were published: "Mme. Swetchine, sa vie, ses oeuvres" (2 vols., 1860). There have since appeared: "Lettres de Mme. Swetchine" (1861); "Journal de sa conversion" (1863); "Correspondance du P&egrave;re Lacordaire et de Mme. Swetchine" (1864); and "Nouvelles lettres de Mme. Swetchine" (1875). Although a Russian Mme. Swetchine wrote well in French; her style is delicate and original, even studied.
