<h1>Sophronius</h1>  

<p>Sophronius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantina or Tella in Osrhoene, was a relative of Ibas, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, and apparently of the same <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> tendency, i.e. strongly anti-Monophysite and liable to be suspected of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>. He was present at a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held at Antioch in 445 at which <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Perrha, was deposed on charges of misconduct, the chief among which was that he had purloined some silver pillars belonging to the church. We have no means of judging whether these charges were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; very possibly, if not trumped up, they were too easily credited from partisan motives. Four years later at the <a href="../cathen/05495a.htm">Robber Council of Ephesus</a> most extraordinary charges of magic and <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">sorcery</a> were brought against Bishop Sophronius. For some reason or other, perhaps because it was foreseen that the charges would break down, perhaps because he was not worth crushing in view of the more important personages being pursued, Sophronius's case was referred to the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, when one should be appointed in place of Ibas whom the Conciliabulum had deposed. Sophronius is next heard of at the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>. At the eighth session, after Theodoret had <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> Nestorius, "the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> cried out 'Let Sophronius also <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a>'. Sophronius, the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantina, said 'anathema to Nestorius and <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches'</a>".

<p>The charges against Sophronius have only been brought to light in recent years by the discovery of a Syriac version of the Acts of the Robber Council. They were made by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and two <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> of Tella (Constantina), who claimed to represent the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of that city. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, they declared, practised <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a> and other vaticinative arts of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>. The miserable <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Nestorius which he had learnt from Ibas was not enough for him, so he threw himself into those other abominations. He once lost some money, and not content with making the suspected <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> swear on the Gospels, "he, further testing them by the ordeal of bread and cheese, compelled them to eat". This not succeeding, he had recourse to the divining cup. He used the son of one of his servants as a medium, and with two others, after some incantations, placed the youth before a vessel containing oil and water. In this mixture the youth first saw flames of fire, then "a man sitting on a throne of gold, and clad in purple and a crown upon his head". After this they put the oil and water in a hole near the door, and the medium saw the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> son Habib who was returning home from Constantinople "seated on a black mare-mule that is blind-folded; and behind him two men on foot". The lad confessed these and other like things on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. He was haunted by seven men dressed in white and lost his reason and was with difficulty cured by being brought into holy places and anointed with oil. Many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, among others the copyists, could testify to Sophronius's <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrological</a> writings. A <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> who came to him, to have a ticket of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> signed, found him inspecting a brass sphere. His son Habib introduced a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> into his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> house and ate with him after the manner of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. "During the week of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, when we fast, he feasted with this <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, and kept him at table till ten o'clock; and even carried his audacity (so far as) to bring him into the Sanctuary of the Apostles, at the time that Service was being held. The city and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, shocked by this conduct, chased both the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> and Habib, who sought refuge in the Pr&aelig;torium of the Commandant (Duke) Florus. The impious and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> Florus rushed upon the city, where (his people) laid violent hands on a great number of men and children &mdash; certainly more than a hundred. In despair, these took refuge near the Tabernacle; but the arrows reached their bodies, their blood was shed before the Altar, and many died in the act of embracing it."
