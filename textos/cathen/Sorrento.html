<h1>Sorrento</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> in the Province of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, with one suffragan, <a href="../cathen/03408a.htm">Castellamare</a>. The city is situated on the southern arm of the Gulf of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and is protected towards the south by Mount Sant' Angelo, which makes Sorrento a popular summer resort. The peninsula is bounded on the one side by the Gulf of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, on the other side by the Gulf of <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a>, and was in Roman antiquity dotted with villas. Sorrento is situated at a considerable altitude above the sea, as it were on a peak. The churches are more ornate than beautiful. There are also ruins of certain <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>: of Ceres, described by Vitruvius (a few columns and <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>); of Venus, near the Marina grande; of Sirena; and of Minerva, the latter said to have been built by Ulysses, the reputed founder of the city, which in ancient times had its own <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> and was autonomous. In 312 B.C. it became the ally of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; but Hannibal captured it in the Second Punic War. <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> sent a colony thither. In A.D. 645 Radolfo, Duke of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Beneventum</a>, besieged it in vain; it remained Byzantine, and as late as the eighth century had probably a dux (chief magistrate) of its own, and was almost completely independent of Constantinople. In 890 the Sorrentines won a naval victory over the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a>. In 1035 it was conquered by Guaimario IV, Duke of <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a>, who made his brother Guido Duke of Sorrento; but forty years afterwards it fell with <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a> under Norman domination. Sorrento is the birthplace of <a href="../cathen/14463d.htm">Torquato Tasso</a>. The Gospel was preached at Sorrento probably as early as the first century; the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> Quartus, Quartillus, and their companions are <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> there. Among the known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the first is St. Renatus, a native of Angers, at the beginning of the fifth century. His successor was St. Valerius, who died in 453; Rosarius was present at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 499. The Sorrentines venerate other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>: St. Athanasius, St. Johannes (about 594), <a href="../cathen/01380b.htm">St. Amandus</a> (d. 617), St. Baculus (seventy century), St. Hyacinthus (679). In the tenth century it became a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>, the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> being Leo Parus. Among its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were Francesco Remolino (1501), who was made a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and ransomed with the treasures of the church (in part his own donations), and Filippo Strozzi (1525), said to have been three times rescued from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> in the sack of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1527. In 1558 the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> under Pialy Pasha effected a landing at <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a>, and plundered and burned the city, on which occasion the archives perished. The new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Giulio Pavesi, sought to repair the damages. Diego Pietra (1680) founded the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, afterwards enlarged by Filippo Anastasi (1699); the latter defended the <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and was forcibly exiled to <a href="../cathen/14518c.htm">Terracina</a>. In 1861 Francesco Apuzzo was, by order of the new Government, exiled to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In 1818 the Dioceses of Massa Lubrense, Vico Equense, a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a>, and Capri were united with Sorrento. Massa is an ancient city, the fame of whose celebrated temple (<em>delubrum</em>) of Juno Argiva is still preserved in the title of the church known as the Madonna della Lobra. It became an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> probably when Sorrento was made <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>; the first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Pietro Orsi, in 1289 delivered from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. Vico Equense, the ancient &AElig;qua, destroyed in the Social War, probably had a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at the same time as Massa Lubrense; the first known was Bartolomeo (1294). Paolo Regi (1582), a renowned legist, compiled the lives of the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and was a prolific writer. The last <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Michele Natali (1797), condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> in 1799 for having taken part in the revolution of that year.

<p>The Island of Capri was even in antiquity celebrated for its climate. <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> acquired it from the Neapolitans, and <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a> built there his famous villa. <a href="../cathen/04166a.htm">Commodus</a> banished thither his wife Crispina. Justinian gave the island to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>. In 868 it was captured by the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a>; from 1806-1808 it was in possession of the English. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a> named its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (987), a certain Johannes. Sorrento has thirty-six <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 267 secular and 34 <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and 59,600 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; 8 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> for men and 21 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, 3 institutes for boys and 10 for girls.
