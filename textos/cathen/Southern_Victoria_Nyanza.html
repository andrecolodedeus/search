<h1>Southern Victoria Nyanza</h1>  

<p>Vicariate apostolic erected from the mission of Nyanza, 13 June, 1894, lies north of the <a href="../cathen/15204a.htm">Vicariate of Unyanyembe</a>, and comprises the land surrounding the southern half of Lake Victoria Nyzanza from Lake Kivu in the west to Lake Natron in the east, on the Anglo-German frontier (36&#186; E). The mission thus including the northern portion of German East Africa is entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/15613d.htm">White Fathers</a>, who first settled in the district in 1883, when expelled from Uganda (see VICARIATE OF THE UPPER NILE). They were well received by the Wasukuma and the Unyamwezi, but these people being engaged chiefly as porters for caravans, have all the vices natural to a roving life and but little inclination for religion; progress among them has been slow, but the fruit is permanent. About 1896 a mission was established on the island of Ukerewe, as a result of numerous conversions made there for some years previous by a native who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in 1889 at the first mission headquarters Notre-Dame de Kamoga and had returned to spread the light among his fellow-islanders. As <a href="../cathen/02564a.htm">polygamy</a> and <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> are practically unknown in Ukerewe good progress has been made. In 1900 the Mission of the Sacred Heart, Isavi, near Lake Kivu, in Ruanda was established among the Bahutus, a simple laborious race, rarely indulging in <a href="../cathen/02564a.htm">polygamy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> natives of the vicariate are a source of great consolation to the missionaries, they recite the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">rosary</a> daily, very many attend daily Mass, and most of them approach the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> weekly; they have a strong filial <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to the Blessed Virgin</a> and some, especially those of Baganda race, give <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of a very high degree of virtue and a wonderful delicacy of sentiment.
