<h1>Spanish-American Universities</h1>  

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of St. Mark's at <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a> enjoys the reputation of being the oldest in America; it has the distinction of having first begun its course by royal decree. The university in <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a> in the West Indies was the first to be established by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a>. Other similar institutions soon arose all over Spanish America, flourishing during the colonial period, under the joint auspices of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. Then, when the Revolution came, they passed from the direct control of the former to that of the latter, with the exception of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/07153b.htm">Havana</a>, which remained in possession of a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order until late in the nineteenth century. It was in 1538 that a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> established the pontifical University of St. Thomas in <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a>, at the request of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. However, the institution was not definitively established, until Philip II gave it legal existence in 1558, seven years after the foundation of St. Mark's in <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>. The University of <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a> had faculties of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and medicine, and lasted throughout the colonial period. The University of <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a> was founded by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> in 1551 in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Holy Rosary, remaining under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> until 1571, when, being confirmed by <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pope Pius V</a>, it passed into the hands of seculars. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> still continued, however, to occupy posts of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. For centuries the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> exercised an influence that spread over all the colonies of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in South America, and many eminent men went out from its lecture-rooms. The renowned Pedro Peralta and the French savant, Godin, were among its professors in the eighteenth century, while such men as the poets O&ntilde;a, Castellanos, and Olmedo, and the first American bibliographer, Leon Pinelo, were among its students. The faculties of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> included <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, medicine, and, for a time, the language of the Incas.

<p>The next in importance of the <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peruvian</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> was that of <a href="../cathen/04580c.htm">Cuzco</a>, founded, in 1598, as the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/13424b.htm">San Antonio</a> Abad. In the seventeenth century the University of Guamanga in <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> was established with the same faculties as that of <a href="../cathen/04580c.htm">Cuzco</a>. In the meantime, <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> studies had been inaugurated at <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a> with the establishment, in 1586, of the University of San Fulgencio, under the Augustinian fathers, by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>. A second University of <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a>, the one which gained the greatest prominence in the colonial period, was that of St. Gregory the Great, founded by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1620. The early seventeenth century was a period of considerable literary activity and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work in Spanich America, and several <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> were founded. In 1627 the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> succeeded in establishing their royal and pontifical University of Santo Tomas, at <a href="../cathen/13457a.htm">Santa Fe</a> de Bogot&aacute;, while the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> continued their old Colege of San Luis, founded in 1592, as the Xavierian University. The University of Santo Tomas obtained renown through such eminent jurists as Luis Brochero, and such linguists as the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Bernardo de Lugo. The celebrated historian of <a href="../cathen/04121b.htm">New Granada</a>, Fern&aacute;ndez de Piedrahita, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11438a.htm">Panama</a>, was a doctor of this <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> arrived in <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a> in 1593 and at once inaugurated higher studies with chairs of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. However, the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of founding the first <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in Santiago belongs to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. It was established in the Monastery of the Holy Rosary, under the title of Santo Tomas in 1619, by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>, that permitted its existence for ten years. In 1684 its privileges were renewed by <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> for a period to last until Santiago should possess a public <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. The faculties included <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, history, <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> philosophy, physics, mathematics, canon law, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. In the meantime, as early as 1621, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had obtained from <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Pope Gregory XV</a> the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "In eminenti" which granted the privilege of conferring degrees for ten years. This privilege was renewed by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> for another ten year s, and finally granted without limitation in 1634. There were thus two pontifical <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> in Santiago. Finally, in the first half of the eighteenth century, Santiago beheld the foundation of its Royal University of San Felipe by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of Philip IV in 1738, with chairs of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, canon and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, mathematics, cosmography, <a href="../cathen/01457e.htm">anatomy</a>, medicine, and Indian language. About the time that the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> were established at <a href="../cathen/13460a.htm">Santiago</a>, Characas, in Upper <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, now <a href="../cathen/02627a.htm">Bolivia</a>, beheld a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> arise in that of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, founded in 1623. This became one of the most famous in the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>. Towards the end of the eighteenth century, however, the spirit of this <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> had grown to be quite anti-clerical. Yet it produced a number of distinguished men, such as Mariano Moreno, Bernardo Monteagudo, Jos&eacute; Ignacio Gorriti, and Jos&eacute; Mariano Serrano. In 1622 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at C&oacute;rdoba del Tucuman, founded a few years earlier in what is now the <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentine Republic</a>, was raise d to the rank of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a> and a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of Philip III. After the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, it passed for a brief period to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, until towards the end of the eighteenth century it was taken over by seculars. Two <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> were established in the eighteenth century, the one in <a href="../cathen/15327a.htm">Venezuela</a>, the other in <a href="../cathen/04558c.htm">Cuba</a>. In 1722 the old <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Santa Rosa, founded at <a href="../cathen/03328d.htm">Caracas</a> by Don Diego de Ba&ntilde;os y Sotomayor, was raised to the rank of a royal and pontifical <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of Philip V and a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/08023a.htm">Innocent XIII</a>, the faculties of <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> and medicine being added to those that already existed. The year before the granting of the faculties to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of Venezuela, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> of <a href="../cathen/07153b.htm">Havana</a> had obtained from the same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the privilege of establishing a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, which owing to some misunderstanding with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, did not finally begin in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> until 1728. The title of Royal and Pontifical University was accorded to it in 1734.

<p>Such was the condition of <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the West Indies and South America up to the Revolution. Most of the old <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> continued, but no longer under the direct control of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, passing generally, in course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, to the Department of Public Instruction. St. Mark's at <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a> still exists, and preserves its autonomy, with the old title of pontifical, and with a faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, though it is said that in its secular departments, its religious influence has passed away. The University of <a href="../cathen/04580c.htm">Cuzco</a> occupies today a portion of the former <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>. That of San Cristobal at <a href="../cathen/02164a.htm">Guamanga</a> became extinct in 1878. The University of St. Augustine at <a href="../cathen/01701b.htm">Arequipa</a> still exists, and Trujillo, where a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was founded in 1621, enjoys today the benefits of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. The University of Sucre (Characas) is still regarded as the best in <a href="../cathen/02627a.htm">Bolivia</a>, where the Universities, also, of <a href="../cathen/08795a.htm">La Paz</a>, Santa Cruz, and Cochabamba exist. The <a href="../cathen/02627a.htm">Bolivian</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> have faculties of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, subject to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> control.

<p>Colombia has today a national <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at <a href="../cathen/02612a.htm">Bogot&aacute;</a>, consisting of faculties in separate colleges. There are also <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> at Cauca, Antioquia, Nari&ntilde;o, and <a href="../cathen/03384b.htm">Cartagena</a>. At <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a> higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> is imparted in the Central University of <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, among them <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, being permitted to hold chairs. Venezuela has actually two <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, the Central University and that of Los Andes. The old <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> University of C&oacute;rdoba is today one of the three national <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentina</a>. At Santiago de Chile, the convictorium of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> has become the Instituto Nacional, that serves as a preparatory <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the National University which is the historical sequel of San Felipe. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/07153b.htm">Havana</a> remained in charge of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> until 1842, when it was secularized. It still exists, with faculties of letters and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and medicine. At present there are two <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> in South America, the one of Santiago de Chile, founded by Archbishop Casanova in 1888, and the other at <a href="../cathen/03035a.htm">Buenos Aires</a>. The former has faculties of law, mathematics, agriculture and industry, and engineering. The Catholic University of <a href="../cathen/03035a.htm">Buenos Aires</a>, still in the formative period, has faculties of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and social <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. The tendency of South American <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> today is rather practical than theoretical and classical, much stress being laid upon such studies as engineering and others of a practical nature.
