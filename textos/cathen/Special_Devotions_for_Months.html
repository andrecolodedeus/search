<h1>Special Devotions for Months</h1>  

<p>During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the public functions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the popular devotions of the people were intimately connected. The <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> assisted at the daily psalmody, the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacrifice of the Mass</a>, the numerous processions, and were quite familiar with the liturgy. Those few religious practices outside of official services, e.g. the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> (a substitute for the 150 Psalms) originated in the liturgy. Later, however, especially since the sixteenth century, popular devotion followed its own channels; unliturgical practices like the Stations of the Cross, the <em>Quarant 'Ore</em>, various <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a> and <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">rosaries</a> (<em>coronae</em>), prevailed everywhere; novenas and series of <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and week-days in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of particular <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> or mysteries were instituted. Entire months of the year were given over to special devotions. Following is a list of the more common devotions with the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> attached:
<h2>January</h2>

<p>The Holy Name of Jesus (feast of the Holy Name, second <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> after Epiphany); <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, one hundred days each day if the devotion is made privately, three hundred days each day, if the devotion be in a public church or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> for daily assistance at the public functions, under the usual conditions (<a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, "Brief", 21 Dec., 1901; "Acta S. Sedis", XXXIV, 425).
<h2>March</h2>

<p>St. Joseph (feast, 19 March); <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, three hundred days daily for those who privately or publicly perform same <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> practice in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Joseph, during the month, a plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> on any day of the month under the usual conditions (<a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, "Rescript Congr. Indulg.", 27 April, 1865). This month of devotions may commence in February and be concluded 19 March (<a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, 18 July, 1877). March can be replaced by another month in case of legitimate impediment (Raccolta, 404). The practice of a triduum before the feast of St. Joseph has been recommended by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> (Encycl. "Quamquam pluries", 15 August, 1889).
<h2>May</h2>

<p>The Blessed Virgin Mary. The May devotion in its present form originated at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where Father Latomia of the Roman College of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, to counteract infidelity and immorality among the students, made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> at the end of the eighteenth century to devote the month of May to Mary. From <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the practice spread to the other <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a> and thence to nearly every <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church of the Latin rite (Albers, "Bluethenkranze", IV, 531 sq.). This practice is the oldest instance of a devotion extending over an entire month. <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a>, three hundred days each day, by assisting at a public function or performing the devotion in private, plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> on any day of the month or on one of the first eight days of June under the usual conditions (<a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, 21 March, 1815, for ten years; 18 June, 1822 <em>in perpetuum</em>).
<h2>June</h2>

<p>The Sacred Heart. This devotion, long privately practised, was approved by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, 8 May, 1873 (Rescr. auth., n. 409), and urgently recommended by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in a letter addressed by the Cardinal Prefect S.R.C. to all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 21 July, 1899. <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a>: (a) seven years and seven quarantines each day for performing the devotion publicly or privately; (b) if the devotion is practised daily in private, or if a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> assists at least ten times at a public function, a plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> on any day in June or from 1-8 July (Decr. Urbis et orbis, 30 May, 1902); (c) the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> <em>toties quoties</em> on the thirtieth of June or the last Sunday of June (26 Jan., 1908) in those churches where the month of June is celebrated solemnly. <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> (8 Aug., 1906) urged a daily sermon, or at least for eight days in the form of a mission (26 Jan., 1908); (d) to those <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who preach the sermons at the solemn functions in June in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Sacred Heart and to the rectors of the churches where these functions are held, the privilege of the Gregorian Altar on the thirtieth of June (<a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, 8 Aug., 1906); (e) plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> for each Communion in June and to those who promote the solemn celebration of the month of June ("Acta Pontificia", IV, 388, 8 Aug., 1906).
<h2>July</h2>

<p>The Precious Blood (feast of the Precious Blood; first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of July). This devotion was propagated by Bl. Caspar Buffalo (d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 28 Dec., 1837), founder of the <a href="../cathen/12374a.htm">Congregation of the Precious Blood</a> of Jesus Christ. <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a>, for the public devotion: seven years and seven quarantines each day; plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> on any day in July or 1-8 August, after having assisted eight times at a public function under the usual conditions; if the devotion be held privately three hundred days each day with plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> on 31 July, or 1-8 of August (<a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, 4 June, 1850). For this practice any other month or any period of thirty days during the year may be chosen (Raccolta, 178).
<h2>September</h2>

<p>The Seven Dolours of the Blessed Virgin Mary (feast of the Seven Dolours, third <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> in September); <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, three hundred days each day and the devotions may be performed in public or private; plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> on any day of September or 1-8 October under the usual conditions (<a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, <a href="../cathen/12620a.htm">"Raccolta"</a>, 27 Jan., 1888, 232).
<h2>October</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Holy Rosary</a> (<a href="../cathen/13189a.htm">feast of the Holy Rosary</a>, first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> in October). <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> personally instituted this practice in an <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> (1 Sept., 1883) in which he admonished the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to dedicate the month of October to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Queen of the Holy Rosary</a> in order to obtain through her intercession the grace that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may console and defend His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in her sufferings, and for nineteen years he published an <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">encyclical</a> on this subject. By the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Congregation of Rites (20 Aug., 1885; 26 Aug., 1886; 2 Sept., 1887) he <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> that every year during the entire month of October, including the first and second of November, in every <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> church, and in all other <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> which are dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, five decades of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> and the Litany of Loreto are to be recited, in the morning during Mass or in the afternoon whilst the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is exposed, and by the encyclical letter of 15 August, 1889, a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Joseph was added. <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a> (S. C. Indulg., 23 July, 1898): (a) seven years and seven quarantines every day for the public or private recitation of five decades; (b) plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> on the <a href="../cathen/13189a.htm">feast of the Holy Rosary</a> or during the octave for those who during the entire octave recite daily five decades and fulfil the other usual conditions; (c) plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> on any other day of the month for those who, after the octave of the feast, recite for at least ten days five decades (<a href="../cathen/12620a.htm">"Raccolta"</a>, 354; Albers, "Bluethenkr&auml;nze", III, 730 sq.). Also in October there are devotions in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a> (feast, 4 Oct.); <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, three hundred days each day by assisting at the public devotions in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Francis in a church or public oratory; plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> on the feast of St. Francis or during the octave (11 June, 1883, for ten years; 29 Feb., 1904, <em>in perpetuum</em>; "Acta Minorum", 1904, 106). Any other month may be selected instead of October.
<h2>November</h2>

<p>The Holy Souls in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> (2 Nov., Commem. of all the Faithful Departed); <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, seven years and seven quarantines each day; plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> on any day of month under the usual conditions (<a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, 17 Jan., 1888). Popular devotion has also selected other mysteries and has dedicated January to the Holy Childhood and the hidden life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> according to the Gospel of the first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> after Epiphany; March, to the Holy Family, on account of the feast of St. Joseph and the Annunciation (25 March); August, to the Maternal Heart of Mary (feast on the Sunday after twenty-second of August); October, to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Holy Angels</a> (feast, 2 Oct.); December, to the Immaculate Conception (feast, 8 Dec.). or to the Holy Child in the stable at Bethlehem (25 Dec.). These practices, however, are not formally approved by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, nor enriched with <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>.

<p>These devotions, of course, vary with conditions in different countries. Though there is a wide variety, constantly changing, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> more commonly used are the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09290a.htm">Holy Name</a>, Sacred Heart, <a href="../cathen/13356b.htm">St. Joseph</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09287a.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgenced</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12620a.htm">Raccolta</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">rosary</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. For the May and June devotions, a short sermon or instruction usually follows, with Benediction of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> concluding the services.
