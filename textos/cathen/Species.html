<h1>Species</h1>  

<p>In scholastic terminology, Species is the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> determinant of every cognitive process. Few scholastic doctrines have been more frequently misunderstood, misrepresented, and ridiculed than that of the <em>species intentionales</em>. And yet few are more obvious and unobjectionable, although we are no longer accustomed to them. While using different terms, modern <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a> offers an explanation of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which, in its essential features, is identical with that which was proposed by the great thinkers of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>.

<p>Knowledge is essentially the union of an object with the mind. As the cognitive process takes place in the mind, it follows that the known object must in some manner be present in the mind. "Cognitio contingit secundum quod cognitum est in cognoscente" (<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, "Contra gentiles", II, c. lxxvii and xcviii). Any cognitive faculty is indetermined, or in potentia in two ways: <ul><li>(1) as we have no innate <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, it is at first a mere aptitude to acquire <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, a power which is not always exercised; <li>(2) the same faculty is capable of knowing many things.</ul>

<p>Thus the eye can perceive any colour; the ear, any sound; the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, any conceptual relation, etc. To pass from this state of twofold indetermination to a concrete and determined act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the faculty needs a complement, a determining principle, or actus (see <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">ACTUS ET POTENTIA</a>). It must be "informed", or acted upon, by its object. For this reason all faculties of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> were called passive, not in the sense that the mind is merely passive in its cognitive process, but in the sense that it must first be acted upon, and thence be enabled to exercise its own cognitive activity. In other words, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not a spontaneous activity springing from the mind alone, but a reaction in response to an external stimulation.

<p>The "species", frequently also called <em>forma</em>, is the determinant of the mind in the process of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. It partakes of the nature both of the object from which it proceeds, and of the faculty in which it is received, for, as the scholastic axiom expresses is: "Quidquid recipitur per modum recipientis recipitur." And more specifically: "Cognitum. est in cognoscente secundum modum cognoscentis" (<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> "Summa theol.", I, Q. xii, art. 4). Hence the <em>species impressa</em> is the modification of the faculty by the action of the object. The <em>species expressa</em> is the reaction of the mind as a cognitive process. The former is impressed in the faculty which it determines, and corresponds to the passive phase of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> condition but is not yet actual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. The latter is the active response of the faculty, the cognitive process itself by which the mind reaches the object. The species must not be conceived as a substitute for the object, but as a mere medium of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. The mind reaches the object directly and immediately, not the species. The species is not that which is known, "id quod cognoscitur", but that by which the object is known, "id quo objectum cognoscitur" (St. Thomas, "Summa theol.", I, Q. xii, art. 9; Q. xiv, art. 5; Q. lxxxv, art. 2; "De Veritate", Q. x, art. 8, ad 2<sup>um</sup>, etc.). The object as acting on the faculty, and the faculty as acted on by the object, are one and the same reality. <em>Actio</em> and <em>passio</em> are the same thing with two aspects or phases. Hence there is no need of a bridge to pass from the subject to the object. The question: how can the mind <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> extramental objects? has no meaning when <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is conceived as the vital union of the known object with the knowing mind.

<p>This general function of the species applies to both sensitive or organic and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> or spiritual faculties of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. The <em>species sensibilis</em> is not an efflux from the object, not a physical miniature of it &mdash; a view which was accepted by some interpreters of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, but which the great scholastics, with <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, reject. It is a modification of the sense organ by the action of the object. It is sometimes called material because it results from the activity of material objects, and is a modification of a material organ. Sometimes also it is called intentional, or even spiritual, because it is not in itself a material representation, and is not received in physical matter, but in an organ which is animated by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. In other words, it is psychophysical. The <em>species intelligibilis</em> is the determinant of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. It is elaborated from the data of the senses by a special activity of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> (<em>intellectus agens</em>), and received in the <em>intellectus patiens</em> or <em>possibilis</em> which elicits the act itself of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (see <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">INTELLECT</a>).
