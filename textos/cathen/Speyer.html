<p>DIOCESE OF SPEYER (SPIRA)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. The city dates back to the stronghold of Noviomagus, in the territory of the German tribe of the Nemetes, on the left bank of the Rhine. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> a Roman municipality (Colonia Nemetum) developed out of this stronghold; in 451 the municipality was entirely destroyed by <a href="../cathen/02061b.htm">Attila</a>. From its ashes arose a new city, Spira of Speyer. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> found entrance into the city in the time of the Romans. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Jesse (Jessius), is mentioned in the Acts of the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a> (343) and of Cologne (346), but his historicity is not quite certain. On the other hand there is positive <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of Bishop Hilderich who attended the Synod of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> held in 614. Since his episcopate the succession of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> has been unbroken. In 748 Speyer was made suffragan of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>; and in 1030 the first stone of the present Romanesque Cathedral of Our Lady was laid; it was intended to be the mausoleum of the Salian emperors. In the struggle over investitures, Bishops Huzmann (1073-90) and Johann I (1090-1104) upheld the <a href="../cathen/07230a.htm">Emperor Henry IV</a> and died under the ban of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 1146 <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> preached the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> at Speyer and won King Conrad III to the cause. Beside the four Salian emperors, Philip of Swabia, Rudolph of Habsburg, and the rival kings, Adolph of Nassau and Albert of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, are also buried in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. A lay brotherhood, the Twelve Brothers of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> without intermission in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, for the repose of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of these kings. Among the later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Matthias of Ramung (1464-78) should be especially mentioned for his reforming the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people, and bringing new life into the diocese.

<p>At the time of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> several Diets were held at Speyer, the most important being in 1526 and 1529. In 1526 the condition of political affairs enabled the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> to secure the relatively favourable decision that each constituent state should act in reference to the matters contained in the Edict of Worms (1521) as it could answer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the emperor. But the action taken in 1529 was more decided: the Edict of Worms was to be executed, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> innovations were to be abolished. Against this the Evangelical constituents protested. By the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> the diocese lost two thirds of its <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. Bishop Eberhard von Dienheim (1581-1610) sought to introduce the reforms ordered by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> in the remaining territory. The gains temporally acquired during the Thirty Year's War were nearly all lost by the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> (1648). The diocese suffered greatly during the predatory <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV of France</a>, and in 1689 the city and <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> were burned. In 1794 the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which had been restored at great expense, was once more ravaged by the lawless soldiery of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. In 1801 that part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> on the left bank of the Rhine had to be ceded to <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>; in 1815 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was assigned to <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>; in 1817 it received new boundaries in the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Concordat and was made suffragan of the new <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> Bamberg. By the liberality of King Louis I of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was suitably decorated (1846-53), the frescoes being done by <a href="../cathen/13591a.htm">Schraudolph</a>. The area of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> corresponds to that of the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Palatinate of the Rhine. Dr. Michael Faulhaber, formerly a professor at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1910. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has 120 deaneries, 235 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 6 curacies, 86 chaplaincies and vicarships, 377 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, and 10 <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is 413,481; the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> population is about 500,000. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has also 1 <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (Oggersheim), 1 <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (St. Ingbert), and 100 houses for <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>.
