<h1>Spire</h1>  

<p>(From the Anglo-Saxon word <em>spir</em>, meaning "a stalk" or "shoot").

<p><img alt="Image" align="right" src="../images/14220a01.gif"> A tapering construction &#151; in plan conical, pyramidal, octagonal, or hexagonal &#151; crowning a steeple or tower, or surmounting a building, and usually developed from the <a href="../cathen/04379b.htm">cornice</a>; often pierced by ornamental openings and, where there were ribs, enriched with crockets. Sometimes an open <a href="../cathen/08793b.htm">lantern</a> was interposed between the steeple, tower, or roof and the spire. On the continent the architects aimed to make the steeple and spire one, merging them into each other, while in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> they openly confessed it was a separate structure by masking its point of origin behind a plain or pierced parapet, or ornamental battlements. A spire properly belongs to Pointed architecture and hence has never been fully developed except in <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> buildings. As early as the twelfth century they took on different forms, and almost everywhere, from the thirteenth to the sixteenth century, became the terminating construction of every church steeple, tower, or lantern, and also those of secular buildings, more especially in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Their decorative value was very great, more particularly in varying and enriching the sky-line of the buildings which they <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a>, and by the numerous variations of forms and variety of types employed. These forms from such simple examples as that surmounting the south tower of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> to that of <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, where the whole structure is an openwork of tracery. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> Norman churches were without spires, but with the coming in of Early English short ones were introduced; Decorated Gothic called for much higher ones, and the Perpendicular still higher. The earlier spires were generally built of timber, and they were always so when the building was roofed with wood.

<p>These early timber spires were, as a rule, not very tall, but later they reached a greater elevation; that which <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> old St. Paul's in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> is said to have been 527 feet in height. The most lofty spires now in existence &#151; such as those of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>, Coventry, and Norwich &#151; are all of stone. In Central <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> there are many, and in fact wherever suitable stone was easily obtainable. In the north of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, however, in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> among the mountains the bell-gable takes the place of a spire, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> because the large area of the thinly populated <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> made it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to keep the bells uncovered, so that they might be more widely heard. The most beautiful examples of existing spires are to be seen at <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, Laon, <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, cologne, <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>. On some of these buildings there are several spires, in many instances built at different periods: the south spire of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, culminating in a pinnacle 350 feet above the ground, was erected in 1175, while the north spire, with its apex 380 feet above the ground, was not finished until 1513. The so-called spires of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> and those built by Sir Christopher Wren are not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> spires, but merely steeples terminating in a point.
