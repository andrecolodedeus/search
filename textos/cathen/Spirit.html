<h1>Spirit</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>spiritus</em>, <em>spirare</em>, "to breathe"; Gk. <em>pneuma</em>; Fr. <em>esprit</em>; Ger. <em>Geist</em>). As these names show, the principle of life was often represented under the figure of a breath of air. The breath is the most obvious symptom of life, its cessation the invariable mark of death; invisible and impalpable, it stands for the unseen mysterious force behind the vital processes. Accordingly we find the word "spirit" used in several different but allied senses: (1) as signifying a living, intelligent, incorporeal being, such as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; (2) as the fiery essence or breath (the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> <em>pneuma</em>) which was supposed to be the universal vital force; (3) as signifying some refined form of bodily substance, a fluid believed to act as a medium between mind and the grosser matter of the body. The hypothesis of "spirits" in this sense was familiar to the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> age, in fact down to the end of the eighteenth century, "animal spirits", "vital spirits", "natural spirits" were acknowledged agencies in all physiological phenomena (cf. Vesalius, <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a>, Harvey, <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a>, Darwin, etc.) "Magnetic" spirits were employed by Mesmer in his theory in very much the same way as modern Spiritists invoke the "ether" of the physicists.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">Psychology</a>, "spirit" is used (with the adjective "spiritual") to denote all that belongs to our higher life of reason, art, morality, and religion as contrasted with the life of mere sense-perception and passion. The latter is intrinsically dependent on matter and conditioned by its <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; the former is characterized by freedom or the power of self-determination; "spirit" in this sense is essentially personal. <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegelianism</a>, indeed, in its doctrines of Subjective, Objective, and Absolute Spirit, tries to maintain the categories of spiritual philosophy (freedom, self-consciousness and the like), in a <a href="../cathen/10483a.htm">Monistic</a> framework. But such conceptions demand the recognition of individual <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> as an ultimate fact.

<p>In Theology, the uses of the word are various. In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, it signifies sometimes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man (generally its highest part, e.g., "the spirit is willing"), sometimes the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> action of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in man, sometimes the Holy Ghost ("the Spirit of Truth Whom the world cannot receive"). The use of this term to signify the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> life of grace is the explanation of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> language about the spiritual and the carnal man and his enumeration of the three elements, spirit, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and body, which gave occasion to the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the Trichotomists (<a href="../bible/1th005.htm#vrs23">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>, <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#vrs23">Ephesians 4:23</a>).

<p>Matter has generally been conceived as in one sense or another the limitation of spirit. Hence, finite spirits were thought to require a body as a principle of individuation and limitation; only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Infinite Spirit, was free from all admixture of matter. Thus, when we find the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> described as <em>asomatoi</em> or <em>auloi</em>, in the writings of the Fathers, this properly means only that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not possess a gross, fleshly body; it does not at all imply a nature absolutely immaterial. Such Scripture expressions as "bread of angels", "they shall shine as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>", as well as the apparitions of these heavenly beings, were adduced as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of their corporeality. So speak Sts. <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, Hilary, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> and many other Fathers. Even in <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> times, the degree of immateriality that belongs to finite spirits was disputed. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> teaches the complete simplicity of all spiritual natures, but the <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotists</a>, by means of their famous <em>materia primo prima</em>, introduced a real composition, which they conceived to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to a created nature. As regards the functions of spirits in the world, and their active relations to the visible order of things, see <a href="../cathen/07049c.htm">GUARDIAN ANGELS</a> and <a href="../cathen/04713a.htm">DEMONOLOGY</a>. Scripture abounds in instances of their dealings with men, chiefly in the character of intermediaries between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His servants. They are the heralds who announce his commands, and often too the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> who execute His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. They take a benevolent interest in the spiritual good of men (<a href="../bible/luk015.htm#vrs10">Luke 15:10</a>). For these reasons, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> permits and encourages devotion to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.
