<h1>Spiritualism</h1>  

<p>The term "spiritualism" has been frequently used to denote the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the possibility of communication with disembodied spirits, and the various devices employed to realize this <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in practice. The term <a href="../cathen/14221a.htm">"Spiritism"</a>, which is used in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, seems more apt to express this meaning. Spiritualism, then, suitably stands opposed to materialism. We may say in general that Spiritualism is the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which denies that the contents of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> are limited to matter and the properties and operations of matter. It maintains the existence of real being or beings (minds, spirits) radically distinct in nature from matter. It may take the form of Spiritualistic <a href="../cathen/07634a.htm">Idealism</a>, which denies the existence of any real material being outside of the mind; or, whilst defending the reality of spiritual being, it may also allow the separate existence of the material world. Further, Idealistic Spiritualism may either take the form of Monism (e.g., with Fichte), which teaches that there exists a single universal mind or ego of which all finite minds are but transient moods or stages: or it may adopt a pluralistic theory (e.g. with Berkeley), which resolves the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> into a Divine Mind together with a multitude of finite minds into which the former infuses all those experiences that generate the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in an external, independent, material world. The second or moderate form of Spiritualism, whilst maintaining the existence of spirit, and in particular the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> or <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as a real being distinct from the body, does not deny the reality of matter. It is, in fact, the common <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a>. However, among the systems of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> which adhere to <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a>, some conceive the separateness or mutual independence of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body to be greater and others less. With some <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the former class, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body seem to have been looked upon as complete beings merely accidentally united. For these a main difficulty is to give a satisfactory account of the inter-action of two beings so radically opposed in nature.

<p>Historically, we find the early Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> tending generally towards <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">Materialism</a>. Sense experience is more impressive than our higher, rational consciousness, and sensation is essentially bound up with the bodily organism. Anaxagoras was the first, apparently, among the Greeks to vindicate the predominance of mind or reason in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. It was, however, rather as a principle of order, to account for the arrangement and design evident in nature as a whole, than to vindicate the reality of individual minds distinct from the bodies which they animate. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> was virtually the father of western spiritualistic philosophy. He emphasized the distinction between the irrational or sensuous and the rational functions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. He will not allow the superior elements in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or the higher "parts" of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be explained away in terms of the lower. Both subsist in continuous independence and opposition. Indeed, the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is related to the body merely as the pilot to the ship or the rider to his horse. <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> fully recognized the spirituality of the higher rational activity of thought, but his treatment of its precise relation to the individual human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is obscure. On the other hand, his conception of the union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, and of the unity of the human <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, is much superior to that of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. Though the future life of the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and consequently its capacity for an existence separate from the body, was one of the most fundamental and important doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, yet <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> as to the precise meaning of spirituality were not at first clear, and we find several of the earliest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writers (though maintaining the future existence of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> separate from the body), yet conceiving the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in a more or less materialistic way (cf. <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a>, <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, Clement, etc.). The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> philosophic <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Spiritualism received much of its development from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, the disciple of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> philosophy, and its completion from <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a> and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, who perfected the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelian</a> account of the union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body.

<p>Modern Spiritualism, especially of the more extreme type, has its origin in <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a>. <a href="../cathen/09568a.htm">Malebranche</a>, and indirectly Berkeley, who contributed so much in the sequel to <a href="../cathen/10483a.htm">Monistic</a> <a href="../cathen/07634a.htm">Idealism</a>, are indebted to <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a>, whilst every form of exaggerated <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a> which set mind and body in isolation and contrast traces its descent from him. In spite of serious faults and defects in their systems, it should be recognized that <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a> and Leibnitz contributed much of the most effective resistance to the wave of <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">Materialism</a> which acquired such strength in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> at the end of the eighteenth and during the first half of the nineteenth centuries. In particular, Maine de Biran, who emphasized the inner activity and spirituality of the will, followed by Jouffroy and Cousin, set up so vigorous an opposition to the current <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">Materialism</a> as to win for their theories the distinctive title of "Spiritualism". In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, in addition to <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>, Fichte, and other <a href="../cathen/10483a.htm">Monistic</a> Idealists, we find Lotze and Herbart advocating realistic forms of Spiritualism. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, among the best-known advocates of Dualistic Spiritualism, were, in succession to the Scottish School, <a href="../cathen/07123a.htm">Hamilton</a> and Martineau; and of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers, <a href="../cathen/03001a.htm">Brownson</a> in America, and <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">W.G. Ward</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.
<h2>Evidence for the doctrine of spiritualism</h2>

<p>Whilst modern Idealists and writers advocating an extreme form of Spiritualism have frequently fallen into grievous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in their own positive systems, their criticisms of <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">Materialism</a> and their vindication of the reality of spiritual being seem to contain much sound argument and some valuable contributions, as was indeed to be expected, to this controversy.
<h3 id="A">Epistemological proof</h3>

<p>The line of reasoning adopted by Berkeley against <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">Materialism</a> has never met with any real answer from the latter. If we were compelled to choose between the two, the most extreme Idealistic <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">Materialism</a> would be incomparably the more <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> creed to hold. Mind is more intimately known than matter, <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are more ultimate than molecules. External bodies are only known in terms of consciousness. To put forward as a final explanation that thought is merely a motion or <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of certain bodies, when all bodies are, in the last resort, only revealed to us in terms of our thinking activity, is justly stigmatized by all classes of Spiritualists as utterly irrational. When the <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">Materialist</a> or Sensationist reasons out his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, he is landed in hopeless absurdity. <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">Materialism</a> is in fact the answer of the men who do not think, who are apparently quite unaware of the presuppositions which underlie all <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>.
<h3 id="B">Teleological proof</h3>

<p>The contention, old as Anaxagoras, that the order, adaptation, and design evidently revealed in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> postulate a principle distinct from matter for its explanation is also a valid argument for Spiritualism. Matter cannot arrange itself. Yet that there is arrangement in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, an that this postulates the agency of a principle other than matter, is continually more and more forced upon us by the utter failure of natural selection to meet the demands made on it during the last half of the past century to accomplish by the blind, fortuitous action of physical agents work demanding the highest intelligence.
<h3 id="C">Ethical proof</h3>

<p>The denial of spiritual beings distinct from, and in some sense independent of, matter inexorably involves the annihilation of morality. If the mechanical or materialistic theory of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, every movement and change of each particle of matter is the inevitable outcome of previous physical conditions. There is no room anywhere for effective human choice or purpose in the world. Consequently, all those notions which form the constituent elements of man's moral creed--duty, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, responsibility, merit, <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and the rest--are illusions of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. Virtue and vice, <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> and benevolence are alike the inevitable outcome of the individual's circumstances, and ultimately as truly beyond his control as the movement of the piston is in regard to the steam-engine.
<h3 id="D">Inefficacy and uselessness of mind in the materialist view</h3>

<p>Again, unless the reality of spirit distinct from, and independent of, matter be admitted, the still more incredible conclusion inexorably follows that mind, thought, consciousness play no really operative part in the world's history. If mind is not a real distinct energy, capable of interfering with, guiding, and influencing the movements of matter, then clearly it has played no real part in the creations of art, literature, or <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. Consciousness is merely an inefficacious by-product, an epiphenomenon which has never modified in any degree the movements of matter concerned in the history of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>.
<h3 id="E">Psychological proof</h3>

<p>The outcome of all the main theses of <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a>, empirical and rational, in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> systems of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is the establishment of a Spiritualistic <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a>, and the determination of the relations of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. Analysis of the higher activities of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and especially of the operations of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> conception, judgment, reasoning, and self-conscious reflection, proves the faculty of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to which it belongs to be of a spiritual nature, distinct from matter, and not the outcome of a power inherent in a bodily organ. At the same time the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, better than any other system, furnishes a conception of the union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body which accounts for the extrinsic dependence of the spiritual operations of the mind on the organism; whilst maintaining the spiritual nature of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it safeguards the union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body in a single <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.
