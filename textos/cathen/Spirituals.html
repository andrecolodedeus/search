<h1>Spirituals</h1>  

<p>A general term denoting several groups of <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>, existing in the second half of the thirteenth and the beginning of the fourteenth centuries, who, in opposition to the main body of the order, pretended to observe the Rule of St. Francis in its primitive severity. The derivation of the name is not quite clear. <em>Homo spiritualis</em> in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> signified a profoundly religious and ascetic man, almost in the same sense as it occurs in <a href="../bible/1co002.htm#vrs15">1 Corinthians 2:15</a> and <a href="../bible/gal006.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>. In this sense the word is commonly used in the thirteenth century. See examples in "Archiv" of Ehrle-Denifle, III, 600. In its limited application to the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>, according to some it owes its origin to the Rule of St. Francis, where it is said: "Wheresoever there are brothers who see and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they are not able to observe the rule spiritually they ought to, and can recur to their <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>". Quite recently, Father Balthasar, O.F.M., traces it with some probability to the terminology of Joachimism. Joachim in fact styles the "Evangelium &aelig;ternum" as the spiritual Gospel, whose understanding is given through the spiritual <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of spiritual men who are to preach it (Archiv, I, 53-55). To the present writer it would seem that the name was given by the people with whom the Spirituals, on account of their austerity, were generally in favour. In fact in a document of 1316 quoted by Ehrle, "Archiv", III, 601, the Spirituals themselves deny that they have ever sought the name of Spirituals, and therefore that they want no other name than that of <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> imposed by St. Francis. Moreover, we have also a direct testimony, hitherto overlooked, in the "Vita prima" of <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, in which it is recorded that "some called them [the Spirituals] <a href="../cathen/13468b.htm">Sarabaites</a> and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, but by the people they are called Spirituals" (Baluzius, "Vit. Pap. Aven.", Paris, 1693, I, 19). From this it is clear that the name Spirituals is taken in its general sense, when applied by the people to the above-mentioned groups of <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>.

<p>The origin of the Spirituals is not less a subject for controversy than their name. If we are to believe Angelo Clareno's "Chronicle of the seven tribulations" the spiritual tendency in opposition to the larger observance of the community is as old as the order itself. Before modern historians began the history of the Spirituals (1274), Angelo had already told of four persecutions of <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, under Elias, even in the very lifetime of St. Francis himself, and that of <a href="../cathen/08475c.htm">Bl. John of Parma</a> under Crescentius in the lifetime of <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>. It must be admitted that the spiritual tendency existed shortly after the death of St. Francis (1226). Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that Spiritualism appeared first in those places where the first <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> companions of St. Francis lived, such as central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that Angelo Clareno, Ubertin of Cassale, and others who entered the order shortly after 1260 came in contact with some of those men or their disciples, for in their writings these authors constantly refer to the companions of St. Francis and especially to the works of <a href="../cathen/09173a.htm">Brother Leo</a>. To understand and appreciate the movement of the Spirituals, we have above all to consider the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Order of Friars Minor</a> in its general aspect in the second half of the thirteenth century, and here we are forced to admit a certain development, perhaps not clearly foreseen by St. Francis when writing the Rule of 1223. Whilst the founder does not appear to have attached very much importance to the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> studies of his order (see chap. x in the Rule of 1223), it was, however, impossible for such a large moral body as his order to keep aloof from the great speculative and scientific movements of the thirteenth century. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiffs</a> had bestowed on the Mendicants many privileges to enable them to work with more fruit for the benefit of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Thus, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of larger dimensions, which in the time of St. Francis were mostly poor hermitages, were being built in the towns, and beside them sprang up churches.

<p>Attendance at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> and life in towns required certain modifications in the life of the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, perhaps somewhat different from what it may have been in St. Francis's time. The <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> that arose amongst the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> about the observance of the rule were generally settled by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiffs</a> with a view of meeting new conditions, and at the same time safeguarding the letter of the rule. Whilst the greater part of the order followed without reluctance this natural and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> evolution, some more <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, to whom every development seemed a departure from the first ideal of St. Francis, were strongly opposed to it. A similar movement had taken place in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a>, at the same time and in the same region, i.e. that of the Roman Province, which comprised, besides <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself, the Marches, Umbria, and <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. Here, towards the end of the thirteenth and in the beginning of the fourteenth centuries, a reform party had arisen who aimed at a return to the primitive simplicity. The point was discussed in several general and provincial chapters, at last in the provincial chapter at <a href="../cathen/14754a.htm">Todi</a> (1319). Here (1) the innocence of the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> was asserted, and the discussion of controversial points forbidden; (2) the name <em>Spirituals,</em> as a name engendering discord, was not permitted. At the general chapter of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of Preachers</a> at Florence (1321), the Master-General Hero&aelig;us Natabis confirmed the decrees of <a href="../cathen/14754a.htm">Todi</a>, and the whole question seems to have been definitively settled (see bibliography).

<p>Before entering on the history of the different groups of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Spirituals, we must determine the points which are characteristic of all of them: (1) Literal observance of the Rule and Testament of St. Francis. (2) An overrated appreciation of the same rule, and especially of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> poverty. Basing their interpretation on the words of their rule (chap. I), "the rule and life of the Minor brothers is this, namely, to observe the holy Gospel", they considered their rule identical with the Gospel, and as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, they reasoned further, cannot dispense from the Gospel, so he cannot dispense from, or even explain, the rule in any other than a literal sense. Consequently they refused the authentic <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> interpretations. (3) Joachimism. It was the great <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the Spirituals to combine their arguments in faovur of reform with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of Joachimism. Holzapfel (Handbuch, p. 41) goes so far as to say that their poverty was only to cover Joachimism, which was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> aim of the Spirituals. This is certainly exaggerated, for Joachimism existed in the order before the spiritual movement was apparent. Perhaps it is more just to presume that the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of Joachimism, promising a better near future, were resorted to by the Spirituals more as a help and a consolation in their manifold hardships and persecutions. It is certain at any rate that, in the great <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> contest between the Spirituals and the community at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> (1310-12), the object of the Spiritualist contention was not Joachimism, but the real observance of poverty, and of the rule in general. However Joachimism was widely spread amongst the <em>Zelanti,</em> and was most prejudicial to their cause. To their grievances with regard to the observance of the rule, the community replied by accusing them of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, taking the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their assertion from the writings of the great Spiritual, Olivi.



<p>According to the time and place of origin we have to distinguish three distinct groups of Spirituals: (1) the oldest, those of the <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Marches of Ancona</a>, about 1274; (2) the Spirituals in Provence, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, under Olivi (d. 1298); (3) the <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscan</a> group, about 1309.

<p>(1) <em>The Spirituals of the Marches</em> are those as to whose fate we are best informed owing to the fact that Angelo Clareno, author of "Historia septem Tribulationum" and "Epistola excusatoria", belonged to them, and after the death of Peter, <em>alias</em> Liberatus, of <a href="../cathen/09492a.htm">Macerata</a>, 1307, became their leader. (On their history see <a href="../cathen/06244b.htm">F<font size=-2>RATICELLI</font></a>.) They were <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Sancta Romana et universalis Ecclesia", dated from <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, 30 Dec., 1317; they continued to exist, however, as the Fraticelli.

<p>(2) <em>The Province of Spirituals</em> were led by Pierre-Jean Olivi. To this group is due the great process between the Spirituals and the Community at the Papal Court at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> (1310-12). There are several versions as to what constituted the exact cause. Clareno (Archiv, II, 129) tells us that Arnold of Villanueva, the remarkable lay <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, went to Charles II of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and induced the king to write to the minister-general of the order, Gundisalvus of Valleboa, requesting him to desist from interference with the Spirituals of Provence. Meanwhile, Arnold saw <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> personally, and, on the general's advice, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> summoned the heads of the Spirituals in Provence: Raymond Ganfredi, Guido of Mirepoix, Bartholomew Sicardi, and others, as also Ubertin of <a href="../cathen/03396a.htm">Casale</a> from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, commanding them to report upon all observances which were not in accordance with the rule. Another version is given by Raymond of Fronsac, procurator-general of the order (Archiv, III, 18), and by <a href="../cathen/02646a.htm">Bonagratia of Bergamo</a> (Archiv, III, 36). They relate that the citizens of Narbonne (1309) appealed publicly in favour of the Spirituals, and particularly the memory of Olivi. The two versions can very well be combined as they do not exclude each other, and are both in themselves very probable. Ehrle (Archiv, II, 360) and Balthasar (Armutstreit, 264), however, are inclined to believe that King Robert, who succeeded to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, Charles II, in May, 1309, was the one to whom Arnold applied for protection of the Spirituals. Be this as it may, <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> on 14 April, 1310, <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Dudum ad apostolatus" (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. Franc., V, 65) which was very favourable to the Spirituals convoked to the Papal Court. They obtained full immunity for the time of the process between them and the community, and through the same <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> was instituted a commission of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> to hear and examine both parties. It is unnecessary to go into the details of this discussion, which lasted three years, and in which bitter words were said on both sides; it will suffice to point out the result.

<p>The great aim of the Spirituals had been to obtain authorized separation from the order; for, said Ubertin (Archiv, III, 87), "there will never be peace in the Order until leave is given to those who want it, to observe the Rule literally". The Community on the contrary was opposed to that plan, and continued to discredit their opponents by insisting on the real or pretended <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Olivi. In 1312 two <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a> put a term to the <em>magna disceptatio</em>: "Fidei catholic&aelig; fundamento" (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. Franc., V) and "Exivi de Paradiso" (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. Franc., V, I) condemning some <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Olivi. The second enjoined stricter observance of the rule. <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> exhorted the French Spirituals, who during the process had withdrawn from the community, to return to their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and even went so far as to depose some superiors, who had treated them unfairly (Archiv, II, 140; IV, 34). The Spirituals went to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of Beziers, Narbonne, and <a href="../cathen/03331b.htm">Carcassonne</a>. But when Clement and the minister general, Alexander of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, had died (1314), the former harsh superiors were restored (1315). The Spirituals now took a desperate step, in possessing themselves by force of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of Beziers and Narbonne, from which they ejected the <em>Relaxati</em>. Thereupon they were <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by William of Astre, <em>custos</em> of Narbonne (Archiv, I, 544; II, 140). The Spirituals appealed to the General Chapter of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> in 1316 (Archiv, II, 159). <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, who was less favourable to the <em>Zelanti</em> than his predecessor, cited them to his court (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. Franc., V, 118; 120) in 1317 and had them examined before a commission, with the result that their leaders were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, and the others detained in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Quorumdam exigit", 1317 (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. Franc., V, 128), was intended to put an end to the question. After some explanations of the rule the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> enjoined them under obedience and pain of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> to give up all particularities and to submit to the orders of the minister general, and concluded by saying "great is poverty, but greater is obedience". Twenty-five of the detained Spirituals utterly refused to accept the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> and were therefore put before the inquisitor, who succeeded in converting twenty-one of them, whilst the four others, refusing to obey and to recognize the principle of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority on the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Rule, were handed over to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>, 7 May, 1318, and burned as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> (see sentence of the inquisitor Michael Monach in "Miscellanea" of <a href="../cathen/02242a.htm">Baluzius</a>-<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, 1761, II, 148).

<p>(3) <em>The Spirituals of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>,</em> appear in 1309 (see <a href="../cathen/06244b.htm">F<font size=-2>RATICELLI</font></a>). After their flight to <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> directed against them, 23 Jan., 1318, the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Gloriosam Ecclesiam" (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. Franc., V, 137), by which they were <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. The movement of the Spirituals failed to obtain its aim; it even led through the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of its leaders, to <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. However, the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for stricter observance of the rule combined with full submission to authority shortly after received in the first Observant <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and led the order to new prosperity.
