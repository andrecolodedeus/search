<h1>Spoleto</h1>  

<p>ARCHDIOCESE OF SPOLETO (SPOLETANO).

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> in the province of Umbria, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The city is situated on a spur of Monteluco, which belongs to the Sibylline Mountains. In the neighbourhood are marble quarries and coal mines; mineral earths are also found, and in the forests of Monteluco, truffles. The situation of the city upon a steep rock, protected by the mountain, has made it in all times an important fortress. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is an interesting Lombard building, begun in 617 by Duke Theudelapius; the campanile belongs to the tenth century, and the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of 1207 is adorned with a large <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> by Solsernus; the ornaments of the portal are by Gregorius Meloriantius (twelfth century). The interior, restored in 1640 by <a href="../cathen/02510b.htm">Bernini</a>, contains frescoes by <a href="../cathen/12103b.htm">Pinturicchio</a> and by <a href="../cathen/09278a.htm">Fra Filippo Lippi</a>, who is buried here. Without the city, beyond the Porta della Torre (604?), is the ancient Church of San Pietro (fifth century), with interesting <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> of the twelfth century. Not far away, on the crest of the mountain is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Giuliano, where the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Sant' Isacco (sixth century) arose. Other churches are: Il Crocifisso, built on the site and from the materials of an ancient temple; Sant' Ansano, beneath which the foundations of another temple may be visited; San Pietro Martire, with frescoes by Spagna; San Filippo, with four columns of green porphyry taken from the temple of Clitumnus. Among the civic edifices are: Palazzo Comunale, with a collection of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>; the castle of Cardinal Albornoz; and near the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> Palazzo Arroni, which is believed to have been the palace of the dukes of Spoleto. The <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of antiquity include: Porta della Fuga; the ruins of an amphitheatre, and of the Ponte Sanguinario (the bloody bridge); the arch of Drusus and Germanicus.

<p>Spoletium, a city of the Umbrians, received a Roman colony 241 B.C. In 217 Hannibal, after his victory at Lake Trasimenus, was repulsed from the walls of Spoleto. Here, in the Civil Wars, Pompey and Crassus (82 B. C.) conquered the troops of Marius, who, however, found refuge in the city, and were thus the cause of its punishment. Here &AElig;milianus was proclaimed emperor (249), and killed three months later. In the Gothic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> (537) the city surrendered to the Byzantine general, Constantine; but in 546 it was recovered by Totila, and it was not retaken by the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> until 552, when Narses restored the fortifications. In 572 Spoleto became the seat of a Lombard duke, Faroald. He was succeeded by Ariulf, who made frequent expeditions against the Byzantine dominions (579-92 against <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>; 592 against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>). Ariulf was succeeded by Theudelapius, son of Faroald, then came Atto (653), Transemund I (663), Faroald II (703), who ruled conjointly with his brother Wachilap. Faroald II had already captured Classe (the port of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>), when he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> by Luitprand to restore it. He was deposed by his son Transemund II (724), who also rebelled against King Luitprand and formed an alliance with <a href="../cathen/06789a.htm">Gregory III</a>, with whom he found refuge in 738. Ilderic, who had replaced him as duke, was slain by Transemund in 740, but in 742 the latter was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to become a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> by King Luitprand, and the duchy was conferred upon Agiprand (742), who was succeeded by Theodicus. Under <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a> the Duchy of Spoleto was promised to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> by the King of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, and the duke himself was named by Pope Adrian (773), but the succeeding dukes were named by the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> emperors. Winigisus aided <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Pope Leo III</a> against his enemies. Among the dukes of this epoch are the following: Sicco, who was expelled because of his hostility to the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, but was received and made duke at <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Beneventum</a>; Guido I, who divided the duchy between his two sons Lambert and Guido II, the latter receiving the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/03216c.htm">Camerino</a>. Lambert distinguished himself in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, but disgraced himself by massacres at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 867; he was afterwards deposed (871), then restored (876), but was a second time <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">Pope John VIII</a>. In 883 Guido II united under his sway the entire dukedom, which from this time was called the Duchy of Spoleto and <a href="../cathen/03216c.htm">Camerino</a>. After the death of Charles III the Bald (888), Guido had himself <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> Roman Emperor and King of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> under <a href="../cathen/14289c.htm">Pope Stephen V</a> (891); Pope Formosus in 892 also <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> his son Lambert II, who succeeded his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> in the dukedom, kingdom, and empire.

<p>Alberico I, Duke of <a href="../cathen/03216c.htm">Camerino</a> (897), and afterwards of Spoleto, married the <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> Marozia; he was killed by the Romans in 924. His son Alberico II made himself also master of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and remained there until the election to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> of his son <a href="../cathen/08426b.htm">John XII</a>. At this time the <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Emperor Otto I</a> detached from the Duchy of Spoleto the so-called Sabina Langobardica, which was bestowed upon the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In 967 <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a> united the duchy with that of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a> and <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, which was then ruled by Pandolfo Testa di Ferro; but after the death of the latter he detached Spoleto, which was in 989 granted to Hugo, Duke of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. The duchy was united with <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> a second time in 1057, when Godfrey of Lorraine espoused Beatrice, the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Boniface, Duke of Spoleto, and it remained so until the death of the Countess Matilda. During the conflict between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07230a.htm">Emperor Henry IV</a>, the latter named other dukes of Spoleto. After this the dukedom was in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Werners (Guarnieri) of Urslingen, Margraves of <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>. In 1155 <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a> destroyed the city for having made of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> of his ambassador to Apulia. In 1158 the emperor gave the duchy to Guelf VI of Este; Henry VI invested Conrad of Urslingen with it, upon whose death in 1198 it was ceded to <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a>, the cession being confirmed by Otto of Brunswick. The latter, however, in 1209 occupied the duchy for himself, making Dipold von Vohburg duke. In like manner <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> in his different treaties with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> acknowledged its sovereignty over the duchy, but when at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> he occupied it for the empire, and was always joyfully received by the populace (1240). His son, Manfred, on the other hand, did not succeed in winning the people. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> maintained at Spoleto a governor, who was often a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. As early as the thirteenth century, and more frequently in the fourteenth, Spoleto was involved in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, <a href="../cathen/10704a.htm">Terni</a>, and other cities; in 1324 it was almost destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugians</a>. In 1319 the struggle between the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs and Ghibellines</a> tore the city. Cardinal Albornoz favoured the city for the services which it rendered in the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> power, and made it independent of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>. At the beginning of the Great Schism, Pietro di <a href="../cathen/12117a.htm">Prato</a> succeeded in occupying Spoleto for the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a>, but was expelled by <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a>. Ladislaus II, King of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, in 1414 endeavoured in vain to make himself master of the city. <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Pope Eugenius IV</a> named as governor the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, Piero Tomacelli, who was tyrannical to such an extent that the people besieged him in his castle, and in 1438 summoned the bands of Piccinino to free them. In 1480 Cardinal Vitelleschi ended the tyranny of Piero and of the Trinci of <a href="../cathen/06124b.htm">Foligno</a>. The former perished in the Castle of Sant'Angelo. During the fifteenth century the city was often at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and in rebellion against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> power. In the campaign of 1860 in Umbria, Spoleto was heroically defended by <a href="../cathen/11294d.htm">Colonel O'Reilly</a>.



<p>Spoleto venerates as its apostle St. Brictius, who is also <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in other cities of Umbria and <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. It is difficult to discuss the epoch in which he lived because the legend of his life is so full of anachronisms. The names of other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> are also recorded at Spoleto, like St. Gregory the Priest; indeed, the name Ponte Sanguinario is said to record a great massacre of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Another <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was St. Saturnius (270), and during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of St. Savinus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, took place at Spoleto. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of certain date is C&aelig;cilianus, to whom <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Pope Liberius</a> wrote a letter in 354. There is record of Bishop Achilles, who during the conflict between <a href="../cathen/02658a.htm">Pope St. Boniface</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> Eulalius was a visitor of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (418); Bishop Spes (fifth century), who collected the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and erected many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>; St. Amasius (d. 489); St. Johannes, killed by Totila (546). At the time of Bishop Petrus (573) Spoleto was under <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> rule. It is related that an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in Spoleto wished to enter the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Pietro, then the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">force</a>, but was stricken with blindness. To Bishop Chrysanthus (591) <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> wrote four letters, in one of which he admonished him not to discipline fugitive <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> so lightly. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were: Adeodatus (about 777); Siguald (827), formerly <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Echternach; Adalbert (1015), who built the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and the episcopal residence within the city. After he had destroyed the city, <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a> presented to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> the so-called Madonna of St. Luke, a Byantine work with inscriptions of a dialogue between Mary and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. Bishop Nicol&ograve; Porta, who became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1228, was transferred in 1236 to the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Bartolommeo de Bardi, O.Min. (1320), rendered excellent services as Governor of <a href="../cathen/10704a.htm">Terni</a>. In 1417, on the death of Bishop Jacopo, who was a partisan of <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">Pope John XXIII</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> wished to proceed to the election of a new <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> but the people prevented them, proclaiming as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Nicol&ograve; Vivari, the nominee of <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>. Again in 1433 the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> wished to revive their right of electing a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but the intervention of <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a> prevented them. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were: Berardo Erubi (1448), afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, who played an important part in the government of the church; Alessandro Farnese (1555); Alfonso Visconti (1601), founder of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, which was enlarged by his successor Maffeo Barberini (1603), afterwards <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Pope Urban VIII</a>, who ordered the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. After the death of Cardinal Locatelli (1812), <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> nominated Bishop Antonio de Longo, whom the canons were unwilling to obey, and were therefore nearly all exiled. In 1820 Spoleto became a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> and the ancient <a href="../cathen/11101a.htm">Diocese of Norcia</a> was taken from its territory. Of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> we should record: Mastai Ferretti (1827-32), afterwards <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, whose episcopal rule was noteworthy for the manner in which (1837) he persuaded four thousand rebels to lay down their arms.
<h2 id="bevagna">Bevagna</h2>

<p>To the Diocese of Spoleto has been united that of Bevagna (<em>Mevania</em>), an ancient city, which venerates as first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> St. Vincent the Martyr; the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of certain date is Innocentius (487). In the time of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> it was very difficult to provide a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for this see, but in 649 and in 844 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are again recorded. Bevagna (M&aelig;vania, where, in ancient days the white bulls destined for the sacrificial altars were pastured) is situated twenty-two miles south-east of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, at the confluence of the Clitunno and Topino, and contains 6000 inhabitants. The ancient <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was dedicated to <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">St. Michael</a>. The body of Blessed James Bianconi is preserved at Bevagna. Blessed James was born there in 1220. At sixteen he was received into the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican order</a> at Spoleto. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, he devoted his energies especially to the work of extirpating the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11067a.htm">Nicolaites</a> from Umbria, and finally succeeded in converting its chief propagator, Ortinellus. After a life of extraordinary austerity James died on 15 August, 1301. In later times his remains were exposed on three occasions and were found to be incorrupt. Numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were attributed to his intercession and even today they are of not rare occurrence. <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Pope Boniface IX</a> has granted <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> to all those who visit his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> during the first three days of May; <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Pope Clement X</a> extended the celebration of his feast (23 August) to the whole <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> (cf. Jacobilli, "Vita del beato Giacomo da Bevagna", <a href="../cathen/06124b.htm">Foligno</a>, 1644; Piergi, "Vita del beato Giacomo Bianconi da Bevagna", Rome, 1729). Another Blessed James, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, who died on 2 September, 1377, is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> at Bevagna (see "Acta SS.", 1 Sept., 595-6; "Ann&eacute;e dominicaine", VIII, 1898, pp. 779-94).

<h2 id="trevi">Trevi</h2>

<p>Another ancient diocese united with Spoleto is Trevi. The town of Trevi (in ancient days Trebia), about four leagues from Spoleto, is situated on the right bank of the River Clitunno, on a rugged slope at the extremity of Monte Petino. It is in Umbria and so is to be distinguished from the Latin town Trebia. It was founded probably as early as the fifth century B.C. Pliny speaks of it as flourishing and calls its inhabitants "Trebiates Umbri&aelig; populi". There is evidence to show that the Faith was preached there before the end of the second century. In A.D. 296 <a href="../cathen/09637d.htm">Pope Marcellinus</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, as first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Trevi, &AElig;milianus, an <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, who, with his companions Hilarian, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, and Hermippus and Denis, was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> on 28 January, 302, under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>. The body of &AElig;milianus was brought to Spoleto and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> there. During the troubles caused by the barbarian and internal <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were concealed, but in 1660 they were discovered in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Up to the year 1050 nine other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Trevi are known from the lists of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> present at <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; they include: Constantine, in 487; Laurentius, in 499; Propinquus, in 501; Grisus or Priscus, in 743; Valerimus, in 769; Paulus in 826; and Crescentius, in 853. About the middle of the eighth century Trevi came under the temporal dominion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 840 and 881 the city suffered from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> inroads, and in 915 and 924 from an Hungarian invasion. The Trevians sided with the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a> party in their struggles with the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibellines</a>. Among the natives of Trevi the following may be mentioned: Saints Vincent, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bevagna, and Benignus, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; St. Constantinus, Bishop and patron of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> (feast 29 January); Blessed Thomas of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> of the <a href="../cathen/16019a.htm">Institute of Celestine V</a>; Benedetto Valenti, the learned jurisconsult; and Virgilio Lucarini, canon of St. George's Velabro, who founded the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Trevi, which was opened in 1674. Giotta da Vespignano <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> a beautiful fresco in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Holy Cross. In the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Martino was a very valuable <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, representing "The Coronation of the Blessed Virgin in Heaven", attributed by some to Giovanni Spagna, but more likely a work of <a href="../cathen/11737b.htm">Pietro Vannucci (Perugino)</a>; it is now in the Pinacoteca Vannucci, <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>.

<p>In the valley below the town is the celebrated church and shrine of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> delle Lagrime (Our Lady of the Tears). The story of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> image is briefly this: Diotallevio d'Antonio, who lived near the road leading from Spoleto to Trevi, had <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> an image of the Madonna and Child on the outside wall of his house. One day tears were noticed falling from the eyes of the Madonna. The report of this extraordinary phenomenon, which continued for some time, spread far and wide. Official records of the occurrence were made by the municipal authorities. Many <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> and favours were obtained through <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> before the picture. A small <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was erected in August, 1485, and Mass was daily offered therein. On 26 July, 1486, Santa Maria delle Lagrime was chosen patroness of the town. On 27 March, 1487, the large basilica was begun, which on its completion, 8 March, 1489, was confided to the <a href="../cathen/11244c.htm">Olivetans</a>. A contemporary account of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> origin of the shrine by Father Francesco Mugnoni, an <a href="../cathen/11244c.htm">Olivetan</a>, who resided within a short distance of d'Antonio's house, is preserved. The basilica contains <a href="../cathen/11737b.htm">Perugino's</a> "The Adoration of the Magi", and Giovanni Spagna's "Deposition from the Cross". The shrine has been enriched with many beautiful offerings in commemoration of the numerous benefits conferred upon the people of the neighbourhood and visiting <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> through the intercession of Our Lady of Tears. Notable among these is a representation, in silver relief, of the city of Ferni, given by its inhabitants and neighbouring towns in remembrance of their deliverance from the plague.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Mgr. Domenico Serafini, a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> of the Congregation of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, was born at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 3 August, 1852; professed at <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a> on 16 June, 1874; <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on 21 October, 1877; appointed procurator-general of the congregation five years later; in June, 1892, he was elected abbot-general; on 19 April, 1900, he was named <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and on 6 May, 1900, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, in succession to Mgr. Mariano Elzeviro Pagliari (born at <a href="../cathen/03216c.htm">Camerino</a>, in the Marches, on 11 September, 1834, and named to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> on 28 February, 1879). Spoleto has no suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>; it has 172 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with 170 secular and 60 <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, 92,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, 14 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> for men, and 11 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, 3 colleges for boys, and 2 for girls. Its <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> serves for southern Umbria. A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> weekly and a religious periodical are published here.
