<h1>Springfield</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> of Springfield (Campifontis) in <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, erected in June, 1870. It comprises five counties of Central and Western <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>: <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, Hampden, Hampshire, Franklin, and Berkshire. Its area is 4320 square miles, a little over half that of the entire state. According to the census of 1910 the population of the territory within the limits of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was 843,212. Of this number 323,122 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.
<h2>Early history</h2>

<p>Some of the early <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritans</a> of Central and Western <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> became <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in a remarkable manner: children taken captive by French and Indians at Deerfield and Westboro were carried to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and there <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. They married in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and the descendants of some of them attained eminence. Joseph-Octave Plessis, who in 1806 became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Quebec and in a trying time ruled the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> Church with firmness and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, was a grandson of Martha French, who a little over a century before had been carried away from the home of her father, Deacon French of Deerfield. Some Acadians were quartered at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> in 1655, but the last of them returned to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> in 1767. At the time of the Revolutionary War many <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irishmen</a> lived in Central and Western <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>. Some of them must have been <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but there is no evidence that they contributed in any way to the upbuilding of the future Church of Springfield. The foundations of this Church were laid by <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> immigrants, who in 1826 and later came to <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, to Chicopee (then a part of Springfield), and to Pittsfield, to dig canals, to lay railroads, and to build and operate factories. The <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of these immigrants was nourished by apostolic men, of whom the foremost was <a href="../cathen/06084b.htm">Rev. James Fitton</a>. He was born in <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> in 1805 and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by Bishop Fenwick (1827). After a short stay among the Indians at Eastport, <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a>, he was made <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> at <a href="../cathen/07144a.htm">Hartford</a>. His missionary <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> carried him into all parts of New England. In <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> his labours extended from "Boston on the east, to Great Barrington in the Berkshires on the west". In 1830 he said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in Chicopee. On 7 July, 1834, he laid at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> the foundation of the first church which was built in the territory now ruled by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Springfield. He became <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> in 1836. Contemporary with the erection of the church at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, <a href="../cathen/06084b.htm">Father Fitton</a> purchased land south of the town, on which he built a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. This <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> he deeded (1843) to the Rt. Rev. Benedict J. Fenwick, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>. Bishop Fenwick erected upon it the College of the Holy Cross, which he induced the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> to assume charge of. This was the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> college in New England. It began with seventeen students. It has become the largest of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colleges of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, whose students all follow a classical course, including Greek. Its influence is now felt in all parts of the American possessions. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> was composed mainly of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, though it included also French, English, and Americans. From <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> <a href="../cathen/06084b.htm">Father Fitton</a> made missionary trips to the towns along the Blackstone, and to the settlements along the Western Railroad. This work was continued and developed by the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> who succeeded him at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>. Of those the most energetic, as a missionary, was Rev. Matthew W. Gibson, who in thirteen years built churches in nine places of Worcester County and in ten more established <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>.

<p>The first resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Western <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> was Rev. John D. Brady. In 1841 he assumed charge of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Chicopee, which extended over four counties. For four years he shepherded this vast <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> alone. In 1845 Rev. Bernard O'Cavanaugh came to him as an assistant. Rev. Jeremiah O'Callaghan, the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and able, if somewhat eccentric, missionary of Vermont, had said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> at Pittsfield in 1845 and yearly thereafter till 1839. This remarkable man in his old age founded the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> in Holyoke. In 1844 Father Brady built the first church at Pittsfield, of which Rev. Bernard O'Cavanaugh became <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> in 1848. His successor, Rev. Patrick Cudahy, the "church builder of the Berkshires", and <a href="../cathen/02597a.htm">Rev. William Blenkinsop</a>, who continued the work of Father Brady in the Connecticut Valley, organized into new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and prepared for further development the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which was now firmly established in Western <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>. To this development <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> contributed when he made of Central and Western <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> with its see at Springfield.
<h2>Bishops</h2>

<p>Rt. Rev. Patrick T. O'Reilly, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Springfield, was born in Cavan, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 24 Dec., 1833. He came to <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> in his boyhood. He studied classics at St. Charles's College, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> at St. Mary's Seminary, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, 15 August, 1857, by <a href="../cathen/02191a.htm">Bishop Bacon of Portland</a>. He served as assistant to <a href="../cathen/02725b.htm">Father Boyce</a> at St. John's Church, <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, till 1862, when he was sent to organize the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St. Joseph's, <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>. In 1864 he returned to <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. John's. There he remained until he was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Springfield (28 June, 1870), being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 25 September of the same year. He ruled the Diocese of Springfield for twenty-one years and a half. During this time its population increased from 90,000 to 200,000; its <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from 43 to 196; its religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> from 12 to 321; its <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> from 43 to 96; its <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> from 2 to 30. Bishop O'Reilly confirmed 77,000 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. He dedicated 45 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and laid the corner- stones of nearly a hundred buildings <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> either to religion or to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. He gave encouragement to <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of the Sisters of Providence of Holyoke and the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> at Holyoke and at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> were begun during his administration. He died 28 May, 1892. He was succeeded by the present (1911) <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Rt. Rev. Thomas D. Beaven, D.D., who was born at Springfield, March, 1851. He studied at Holy Cross College and at the Great Seminary, <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, 18 Dec., 1875. He laboured at Spencer for three years as assistant and for ten as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. In 1888 he was made <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Holy Rosary, Holyoke. Four years later (31 July) he was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Springfield. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 18 Oct., 1892. Bishop Beaven is an organizer. He has applied to the temporal affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> sound business principles. He has developed the <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Brightside, with its infants' home, its <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>, its Beaven-Kelly Home for aged men, owes its existence to his inspiration and largely to his generosity. During his administration <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> have been opened in <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, Springfield, Montague City, and Adams, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> at Holyoke, <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, and Leicester, a House of the Good Shepherd at Springfield, and homes for working girls in many places. Springfield has for years been remarkable among the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the country for the number of its vocations to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. Four of its <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have become <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> during the present administration: Rt. Rev. Thomas J. Conaty, D.D. (Monterey and Los Angeles); Rt. Rev. Philip J. Garrigan, D.D. (<a href="../cathen/14016a.htm">Sioux City</a>); Rt. Rev. Daniel F. Feehan, D.D. (Fall River); and Rt. Rev. Joseph J. Rice, D.D. (Burlington).
<h2>Causes of growth</h2>

<p>The growth of the Diocese of Springfield is due largely to immigration. The <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> were quickly followed by <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a>, and these by Poles and Lithuanians. The <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> and the Syrians came later. These immigrants came to <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> to get a market for their labour. They prospered and their descendants are among the most esteemed citizens of the commonwealth.
<h2>Religious communities</h2>

<p>About 380 religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are engaged in charitable work in the diocese. Most of these are Sisters of Providence. The <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> (the first <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community to enter the diocese) conduct <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> and Leicester, the <a href="../cathen/07031a.htm">Grey Nuns</a> an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, the Little <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters of Mary an old people's home at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>; and the Sisters of the Good Shepherd have a house at Springfield. The <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> requires the services of 750 sisters. The <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> have a normal college in Springfield, an academy at Chicopee, and high schools in many <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. They also do a great part of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> work. The Sisters of Notre Dame conduct high schools at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, Springfield, Holyoke, and Chicopee. Other communities of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> engaged in teaching are: the Sisters of Holy Cross and of the Seven Dolors, Sisters of St. Ann, <a href="../cathen/02006a.htm">Sisters of the Assumption</a>, Sisters of Providence, Faithful Companions of Jesus, <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> (Hartford), Presentation Nuns (St. Hyacinth, P.Q.), Presentation Nuns (Fitchburg, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>), <a href="../cathen/06027b.htm">Felician Sisters</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters (Buffalo), and Daughters of the Holy Ghost. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of men represented in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>; the Fathers of La Salette, at Fitchburg, Ware, and Westfield; the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> at Chicopee and Holyoke; the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Vincentians</a>, at Springfield; the Fathers of the Assumption, at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/15728b.htm">Xaverian Brothers</a> at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> and Millbury.
<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>Official reports for 1911 give the following figures: 300 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> and 14 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (not including the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at Holy Cross and the <a href="../cathen/02104a.htm">Assumptionists</a> of the Apostolic School); 160 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; 28 missions with churches and 10 stations; 2 colleges attended by 600 students; 4 academies; 61 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with 25,600 pupils; 5 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>; 1 infants' home; 27,000 young people under <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> care; 6 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>; 5 homes for the aged; 3 working girls' homes; 1 industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; and 1 House of the Good Shepherd.
