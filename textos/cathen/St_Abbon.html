<h1>St. Abbon</h1>  

<p>(Or ABBO.)

<p>Born near <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> c. 945; died at <a href="../cathen/06102c.htm">Fleury</a>, 13 November, 1004, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06102c.htm">Fleury sur Loire (Fleuret)</a>, conspicuous both for learning and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, and one of the great lights of the Church in the stormy times of Hugh Capet of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and of the three Ottos of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>.

<p>He devoted himself to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, mathematics, and <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>. In early life he was called to England to direct the school of the newly founded <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/12638a.htm">Ramsey</a>, in the County of Huntingdon, after which he returned to Fleury. On the death of the Abbot Oilbold, Abbon was selected to succeed him, but one of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who had secured the support of the King and his son Robert, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, contested the choice, and the matter assumed national importance in the political forces it brought into play. It was finally settled by the famous Gerbert (later <a href="../cathen/14371a.htm">Pope Sylvester II</a>) in favour of Abbon. He was present at the Synod of St. Basolus (St. Basle), near <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, at which Archbishop Arnolf was tried for treason and <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, to make way for Gerbert. When the question arose about the marriage of Robert the Pious and Bertha, Abbon was commissioned to arrange it with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>. On the way to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he met <a href="../cathen/06790a.htm">Pope Gregory V</a>, who was a fugitive from the city from which the <a href="../cathen/08428a.htm">Antipope John XVII</a> had expelled him. Between the Pontiff and the Abbot the greatest esteem and affection existed. The royal petition for a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> was rejected. Abbon succeeded in bringing about the restoration of Arnulf to the see of Reims.

<p>His influence contributed largely to calm the excitement about the fear of the end of the world which is said to have been general in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in 1000. His glorious life had a sad ending. In 1004 he attempted to restore <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of La Reole, in Gascony, by transferring some of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Fleury into that community. But the trouble increased; fighting began between the two parties and when St. Abbon endeavoured to separate them he was pieced in the side by a lance. He concealed the wound and reached his cell, where he died in the arms of his faithful disciple Aimoin, who has left an account of his labours and virtues. The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> wrought at his tomb soon caused him to be regarded in the <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Church of Gaul</a> as a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept 13 November.
