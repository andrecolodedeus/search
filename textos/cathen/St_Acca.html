<h1>St. Acca</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Hexham</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron</a> of learning (c. 660-742). Acca was a Northumbrian by birth and began life in the household of a certain Bosa, who afterwards became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>. After a few years, however, Acca attached himself to <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a> and remained his devoted <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> and companion in all his troubles. He may have joined Wilfrid as early as 678, and he certainly was with him at the time of his second journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 692. On their return to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, when Wilfrid was reinstated at <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Hexham</a>, he made Acca <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of St. Andrew's <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> there; and after Wilfrid's death (709) Acca succeeded him as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The work of completing and adorning the churches left unfinished by <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a> was energetically carried on by his successor. In ruling the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and in conducting the services of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, Acca was equally <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a>. He brought to the North a famous <a href="../cathen/03306a.htm">cantor</a> named Maban, who had learned in <a href="../cathen/02319b.htm">Kent</a> the Roman traditions of psalmody handed down from <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> through <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>. He was famed also for his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> learning, and for his encouragement of students by every means in his power. It was at Acca's instigation that Eddius undertook the Life of <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a>, and above all, it was to the same kind friend and patron that <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> dedicated several of his most important works, especially those dealing with <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. For some unexplained reason Acca was driven from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in 732. He is believed to have retired to Withern in <a href="../cathen/06370a.htm">Galloway</a>, but he returned to <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Hexham</a> before his death in 742, when he was at once revered as a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">Saint</a>. Two crosses of exquisite workmanship, one of which is still preserved in a fragmentary state, were erected at the head and foot of his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">grave</a>. When the body of the Saint was translated, the <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> were found entire, and the accounts of his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were drawn up by <a href="../cathen/01172b.htm">St. &AElig;lred</a> and by <a href="../cathen/13794d.htm">Simeon of Durham</a>. Of any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> cultus there is little trace, but his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is said to have been kept on 20 October. There is also mention of 19 February, which may have been the date of some translation of his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>.

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The only writing of Acca's which we possess is a letter addressed to St. Bede and printed in his works. This document, together with much other material relating to Acca, has also been printed in RAINE'S <em>Priory of Hexham</em> (London, 1864), Surtees Society, 1864. Our knowledge of Acca's life is derived primarily from BEDE, EDDIUS, SIMEON OF DURHAM, RICHARD OF DURHAM, and AELRED. Adequate accounts may be also found in STANTON'S <em>English Menology</em> (London, 1892), 507; <em>Dict. of Nat. Biog,; Dict. of Christ. Biog</em>. For some archaeological sidelights, cf. BROWNE (Anglican Bishop), <em>Theodore and Wilfrith</em> (London, 1897).</p></div>
