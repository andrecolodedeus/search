<h1>St. Adalbert</h1>  

<p>Born 939 of a noble <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; died 997. He assumed the name of the Archbishop Adalbert (his name had been Wojtech), under whom he studied at <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>. He became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, whence he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee on account of the enmity he had aroused by his efforts to reform the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He betook himself to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and when released by <a href="../cathen/08427c.htm">Pope John XV</a> from his episcopal <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>, withdrew to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and occupied himself in the most <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the house. Recalled by his people, who received him with great demonstrations of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, he was nevertheless expelled a second time and returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The people of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> were just then turning towards <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Adalbert went among them as a missionary, and probably <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> King Geysa and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and King Stephen. He afterwards evangelized the Poles, and was made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>. But he again relinquished his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and set out to preach to the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> inhabitants of what is now the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Kingdom of Prussia</a>. Success attended his efforts at first, but his imperious manner in commanding them to abandon <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> irritated them, and at the instigation of one of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> he was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killed</a>. This was in the year 997. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated 23 April, and he is called the Apostle of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. Boleslas I, Prince of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, is said to have ransomed his body for an equivalent weight of gold. He is thought to be the author of the war-song, "Boga-Rodzica", which the Poles used to sing when going to battle.
