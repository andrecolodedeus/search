<h1>St. Adamnan</h1>  

<p>(Or Eunan).

<p><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a>, born at Drumhome, County Donegal, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, c. 624; died at the <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Abbey of Iona</a>, in 704. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by the Columban <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of his native place, subsequently becoming a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> at <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a> in 650. In 679 he succeeded to the abbacy of <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a>, which position he held up to his death. He was also president-general of all the Columban houses in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. During his rule he paid three lengthy visits to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, one of which is memorable for his success in introducing the Roman Paschal observance. On his third visit (697) he assisted at the Synod of Tara, when the <em>Cain Adamnain</em>, or Canon of Adamnan (ed. Kuno Meyer, London, 1905) was adopted, which freed <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children from the evils inseparable from <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, forbidding them to be killed or made captive in times of strife. It is not improbable, as stated in the "Life of St. Gerald" (d. <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mayo, 732), that Adamnan ruled the abbey of Mayo from 697 until 23 Sept., 704, but in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> his memory is inseparably connected with Raphoe, of which he is patron.

<p>From a literary point of view, St. Adamnan takes the very highest place as the biographer of St. Columba (Columcille), and as the author of a treatise "De Locis Sanctis". Pinkerton describes his "Vita Columbae" as "the most complete piece of biography that all <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> can boast of, not only at so early a period but even through the whole <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>". It was printed by <a href="../cathen/04099c.htm">Colgan</a> (from a copy supplied by <a href="../cathen/15612c.htm">Father Stephen White, S.J.</a>), and by the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>, but it was left for a nineteenth-century <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> scholar (Dr. Reeves, Protestant <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Down, Connor and Dromore) to issue, in 1837, the most admirable of all existing editions. <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede</a> highly praises the tract "De Locis Sanctis", the autograph copy of which was presented by St. Adamnan to King Aldfrid of Northumbria, who had studied in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The "Four Masters" tells us that he was "tearful, penitent, fond of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, diligent and ascetic, and learned in the clear understanding of the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scriptures of God</a>." His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated 23 September.
