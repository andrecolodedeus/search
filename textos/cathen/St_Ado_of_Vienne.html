<h1>St. Ado of Vienne</h1>  

<p>Born about 800, in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>; d. 16 December, 875. He was brought up at the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/06049d.htm">Abbey of Ferri&egrave;res</a>, and had as one of his masters the <a href="../cathen/09436b.htm">Abbot Lupus Servatus</a>, one of the most celebrated <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanists</a> of those times. By his brilliant talents and assiduous application Ado gained the esteem of his masters and schoolmates, while his ready obedience, deep <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, and sincere <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> foreshadowed his future <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Though urged on all sides to enter upon a career in the world, to which his nobility of birth and great <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> abilities entitled him, he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> himself entirely to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by taking the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> habit at <a href="../cathen/06049d.htm">Ferri&egrave;res</a>. When Markward, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Ferri&egrave;res, became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/12519a.htm">Pr&uuml;m</a> near <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, he applied for Ado to teach the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred sciences</a> there. His request was granted. Soon, however, certain <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Pr&uuml;m conceived an implacable <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against Ado, and upon the death of Markward, turned him out of their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. With the permission of his <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Ado now made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he remained five years. He then went to <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, where he discovered an old Roman <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> which served as the basis for his own renowned <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> published in 858, which is generally known as the "martyrology of Ado". At <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> he was received with open arms by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12763b.htm">St. Remigius</a>, who, with the <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Ferri&egrave;res, appointed him <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the Church of St. Roman near <a href="../cathen/15423a.htm">Vienne</a>. In 860 he became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Vienne, and a year later received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> from <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a>. By word and example he began reforming the laxity of his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and he gave them strict orders to instruct the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrines of Christianity</a>. His own life was a model of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and austerity. When Lothaire II, King of <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, had <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> dismissed his wife Theutberga and the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">Synod</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> had been <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribed</a> to <a href="../cathen/13428a.htm">sanction</a> the King's marriage to his <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a> Waldrada, Ado hastened to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and reported the crime to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, who thereupon annulled the acts of the synod. Besides the "Martyrology" mentioned above Ado wrote a chronicle from the beginning of the world to A.D. 874, "Chronicon de VI &aelig;tatibus mundi", and the lives of St. Desiderius and St. Theuderius. Ado's name is in the Roman <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> and at Vienne his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 16 December, the day of his death.
