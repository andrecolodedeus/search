<h1>St. Adrian of Canterbury</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">African</a> by birth, died 710. He became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Nerida, a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> near <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, when he was very young. <a href="../cathen/15484b.htm">Pope Vitalian</a> intended to appoint him <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> to succeed <a href="../cathen/04760b.htm">St. Deusdedit</a>, who had died in 664, but Adrian considered himself unworthy of so great a dignity, and begged the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> to appoint <a href="../cathen/14571a.htm">Theodore</a>, a Greek <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, in his place. The Pope yielded, on condition that Adrian should accompany <a href="../cathen/14571a.htm">Theodore</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and be his adviser in the administration of the <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Diocese of Canterbury</a>. They left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 668, but Adrian was detained in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by Ebroin, the Mayor of the Palace who suspected that he had a secret mission from the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Eastern</a> Emperor, Constans II, to the English kings. After two years Ebroin found that his suspicion had been groundless and allowed Adrian to proceed to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Immediately upon his arrival in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/14571a.htm">Archbishop Theodore</a> appointed him <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Peter in <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which had been founded by <a href="../cathen/02081a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, the apostle of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and became afterwards known as St. Austin's. Adrian accompanied <a href="../cathen/14571a.htm">Theodore</a> on his <a href="../cathen/15479a.htm">apostolic visitations</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and by his <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> advice and co-operation assisted the <a href="../cathen/14571a.htm">Archbishop</a> in the great work of unifying the customs and practices of the <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">Anglo-Saxon Church</a> with those of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Adrian was well versed in all the branches of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and profane learning. Under his direction the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">School</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> became the centre of English learning. He established numerous other <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in various parts of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In these <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Adrian were <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> many of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, scholars, and missionaries, who during the next century rekindled the waning light of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and learning in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. After spending thirty-nine years in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> Adrian died in the year 710 and was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated 9 January, the day of his death.
