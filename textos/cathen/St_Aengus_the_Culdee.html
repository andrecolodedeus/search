<div id="springfield2">
<h1>St. Aengus (the Culdee)</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> saint who flourished in the last quarter of the eighth century, and is held in imperishable <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> as the author of the <em>Felir&eacute;</em>, or Festology of the Saints. Born near Clonengh, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, Aengus was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, founded there by St. Fintan, not far from the present town of Mountrath. Becoming a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>, he lived for a time at Disert-beagh, where, on the banks of the Nore, he is said to have communed with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. From his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and solitude he was named the <a href="../cathen/04563b.htm">"Culdee"</a>; in other words, the <em>Ceile D&eacute;</em>, or "Servant of God." Not satisfied with his hermitage, which was only a mile from Clonenagh, and, therefore, liable to be disturbed by students or wayfarers, Aengus removed to a more solitary abode eight miles distant. This sequestered place, two miles southeast of the present town of Maryborough, was called after him "the Desert of Aengus", or "Dysert-Enos". Here he erected a little <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratory</a> on a gentle eminence among the Dysert Hills, now represented by a ruined and deserted <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> church. His earliest biographer (ninth century) relates the wonderful <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">austerities</a> practiced by St. Aengus in his "desert", and though he sought to be far from the haunts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, his fame attracted a stream of visitors. The result was that the good saint abandoned his oratory at Dysert-Enos, and, after some wanderings, came to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Tallaght, near <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, then governed by St. Maelruain. He entered as a lay-brother, concealing his identity, but St. Maelruain soon discovered him, and collaborated with him on the work known as the "Martyrology of Tallaght", about the year 790. This is a prose catalogue of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and is the oldest of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a>. About the year 805 St. Aengus finished his famous <em>Felir&eacute;</em>, a poetical work on the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, a copy of which is in the <em>Leabhar Breac.</em> The last touches were given to this work in the cell at Disert-beagh (St. Aengus had left Tallaght, not long after the death of St. Maelruain), where he passed away on Friday, 11 March, 824. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in Clonenagh, as we read in his metrical life, and his death is commemorated 11 March.
