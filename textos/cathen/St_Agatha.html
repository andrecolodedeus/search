<h1>St. Agatha</h1>  

<p>One of the most highly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity, put to death for her steadfast profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/03429a.htm">Catania, Sicily</a>. Although it is uncertain in which <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> this took place, we may accept, as probably based on ancient tradition, the evidence of her <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">legendary</a> life, composed at a later date, to the effect that her <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> occurred during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a> (250-253).

<p><a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">Historic</a> certitude attaches merely to the fact of her <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> and the public <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">veneration</a> paid her in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> since primitive times. In the so-called <em>Martyrologium Hieronymianum</em> (ed. De Rossi and Duchesne, in Acta SS., Nov. II, 17) and in the ancient <em>Martyrologium Carthaginiense</em> dating from the fifth or sixth century (Ruinart, <em>Acta Sincera</em>, <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, 1859, 634), the <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">name</a> of St. Agatha is recorded on 5 February. In the sixth century <a href="../cathen/06149a.htm">Venantius Fortunatus</a> mentions her in his poem on <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> as one of the celebrated <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> (Carm., VIII, 4, De Virginitate: Illic Euphemia pariter quoque plaudit Agathe Et Justina simul consociante Thecla. etc.). Among the poems of <a href="../cathen/04613a.htm">Pope Damasus</a> published by Merenda and others is a <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> to St. Agatha (P.L., XIII, 403 sqq.; Ihm, Damasi Epigrammata, 75, Leipzig, 1895). However, this poem is not the work of <a href="../cathen/04613a.htm">Damasus</a> but the product of an unknown author at a later period, and was evidently meant for the <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">liturgical celebration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">Saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a>. Its content is drawn from the <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">legend</a> of St. Agatha, and the poem is marked by end-rhyme. From a letter of <a href="../cathen/06406a.htm">Pope Gelasius</a> (492-496) to a certain Bishop Victor (Thiel. Epist. Roman. Pont., 495) we learn of a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">Basilica</a> of St. Agatha <em>in fundo Caclano</em>, e.g., on the estate of that name. The letters of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory I</a> make mention of St. Agatha at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in the Subura, with which a <em>diaconia</em> or deaconry was connected (Epp., IV, 19; P.L., LXXVII, 688). It was in existence as early as the fifth century, for in the latter half of that century Rieimer enriched it with a <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a>. This same <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> was given the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> by Rieimer and was restored to <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">Catholic worship</a> by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope Gregory I</a> (590-604).

<p>Although the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of St. Agatha is thus <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authenticated</a>, and her <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">veneration</a> as a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> had even in antiquity spread beyond her native place, we still possess no reliable information concerning the details of her <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> death. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that we have the <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts of her martyrdom</a> in two versions, <a href="../cathen/09023a.htm">Latin</a> and Greek, the latter deviating from the former (Acta SS., I, Feb., 595 sqq.). Neither of these recensions, however, can lay any claim to <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">historical</a> credibility, and neither gives the necessary internal evidence that the information it contains rests, even in the more important details, upon genuine tradition. If there is a kernel of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">historical</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the narrative, it has not as yet been possible to sift it out from the later embellishments. In their present form the <a href="../cathen/09023a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts</a> are not older than the sixth century. According to them Agatha, daughter of a distinguished <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and remarkable for her beauty of person, was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the Senator Quintianus with avowals of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. As his proposals were resolutely spurned by the pious <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, he committed her to the charge of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, whose seductive arts, however, were baffled by Agatha's unswerving firmness in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a>. Quintianus then had her subjected to various cruel tortures. Especially inhuman seemed his order to have her breasts cut off, a detail which furnished to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/07625a.htm">iconography</a> the peculiar characteristic of Agatha. But the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> was consoled by a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a>, who <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> healed her. Eventually she succumbed to the repeated cruelties practised on her. As already stated, these details, in so far as they are based on the <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts</a>, have no claim to <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">historical</a> credibility. <a href="../cathen/01317a.htm">Allard</a> also characterizes the <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts</a> as the work of a later author who was more concerned with writing an edifying narrative, abounding in <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, than in transmitting <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">historical</a> traditions.

<p>Both <a href="../cathen/03429a.htm">Catania</a> and <a href="../cathen/11419b.htm">Palermo</a> claim the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of being Agatha's birthplace. Her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 5 February; her <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">office</a> in the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> is drawn in part from the <a href="../cathen/09023a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts</a>. <a href="../cathen/03429a.htm">Catania</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honours</a> St. Agatha as her <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a>, and throughout the region around Mt. Etna she is invoked against the eruptions of the volcano, as elsewhere against fire and lightning. In some places bread and water are <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> during <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> on her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">Consecration</a>, and called Agatha bread.
