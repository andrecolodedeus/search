<h1>St. Agnes of Bohemia</h1>  

<p>(Also called Agnes of Prague). Born at Prague in the year 1200; died probably in 1281. She was the daughter of Ottocar, King of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and Constance of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, a relative of St. Elizabeth. At an early age she was sent to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Treinitz, where at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> religious she received the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> that became her rank. She was <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, Emperor of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; but when the time arrived for the solemnization of the marriage, it was impossible to persuade her to abandon the resolution she had made of consecrating herself to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the sanctuary of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. The Emperor Frederick was incensed at the unsuccessful issue of his matrimonial venture, but, on learning that St. Agnes had left him to become the spouse of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he is said to have remarked: "If she had left me for a mortal man, I would have taken vengeance with the sword, but I cannot take offence because in preference to me she has chosen the King of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>." The servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> entered the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Order of St. Clare</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Saviour at <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, which she herself had erected. She was elected <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and became in this office a model of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">Christian virtue</a> and religious observance for all. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> favoured her with the <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">gift of miracles</a>, and she predicted the victory of her brother Wenceslaus over the Duke of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. The exact year of her death is not certain; 1281 is the most probable date. [<em>Note:</em> She was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> a saint by Pope John Paul II on November 12, 1989. Her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on the second of March.]
