<h1>St. Alexander</h1>  

<p>St. Alexander, who died in chains after cruel torments in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a>, was first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cappadocia, and was afterwards associated as coadjutor with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, who was then 116 years old.

<p>This association came about as follows: Alexander had been <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="../cathen/13743a.htm">Alexander Severus</a> and on being released came to Jerusalem, where he was compelled by the aged <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to remain, and assist him in the government of that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. This arrangement, however, was entered into with the <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Palestine. It was Alexander who permitted <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, although only a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, to speak in the churches. For this concession he was taken to task, but he defended himself by examples of other permissions of the same kind given even to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> himself elsewhere, although then quite young. <a href="../cathen/03090a.htm">Butler</a> says that they had studied together on the great <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. Alexander <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> him a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Especial praise is given to Alexander for the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> he built at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.

<p>Finally, in spite of his years, he, with several other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, was carried off a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> to <a href="../cathen/03133b.htm">Caesarea</a>, and as the historians say, "the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of his white hairs and great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> formed a double crown for him in captivity". He suffered many tortures, but survived them all. When the wild beasts were brought to devour him, some licked his feet, and others their impress on the sand of the arena. Worn out by his sufferings he died in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. This was in the year 251. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept by the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latins</a> on 18 March, by the Greeks, 22 December.
