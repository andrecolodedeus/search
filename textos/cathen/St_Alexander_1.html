<h1>St. Alexander</h1>  

<p>St. Alexander, known as "The charcoal burner", was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04151b.htm">Comana</a>, in <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>. Whether he was the first to occupy that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is open to discussion. The <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> have also a long paper as to the exact location of <a href="../cathen/04151b.htm">Comana</a> as there were several plates of that name, but decide for <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, near Neo-Caesarea. The curious name of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> comes from the fact that he had, out of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, taken up the work of burning charcoal, so as to escape worldly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honours</a>. He is called a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, but it is not <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the term is to be taken literally. His philosophy consisted rather in his preference of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a> to earthly things. The discovery of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> was due to the very contempt with which he had been regarded. <a href="../cathen/07015a.htm">St. Gregory Thaumaturgus</a> had been asked to come to Comana to help select a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for that place. As he rejected all the candidates, someone in derision suggested that he might accept Alexander, the charcoal-burner. <a href="../cathen/07015a.htm">Gregory</a> took the suggestion seriously, summoned Alexander, and found that he had to do with a saint and a man of great capabilities. Alexander was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, administered it with remarkable wisdom and ultimately gave up his life for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, being burned to death in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a>. The vagueness of the information we have about him comes from the fact that his name is not found in any of the old Greek or Roman <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">calendars</a>. He would have been absolutely unknown were it not for a discourse pronounced by <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a>, on the life of <a href="../cathen/07015a.htm">St. Gregory Thaumaturgus</a>, in which the election of Alexander is incidentally described. In the modern Roman <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">Martyrology</a> his name occurs, and he is described as a "philosophus disertissimus." His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 11 August.
