<h1>St. Alexander</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth uncertain; died 17 April, 326. He is, apart from his own greatness, prominent by the fact that his appointment to the patriarchial see excluded the heresiarch <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> from that post. Arius had begun to teach his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> in 300 when Peter, by whom he was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, was Patriarch. He was reinstated by Achillas, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">successor of Peter</a> and then began to scheme to be made a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. When Achillas died Alexander was elected, and after that Arius threw off all disguise. Alexander was particularly obnoxious to him, although so tolerant at first of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Arius that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> nearly revolted. Finally the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was condemned in a council held in <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, and later on, as is well known, in the general Council of Nicaea, whose Acts Alexander is credited with having drawn up. An additional merit of this great man is that during his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> he passed through the bloody <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> of <a href="../cathen/06341a.htm">Galerius</a>, Maximinus, and others. It was while his predecessor Peter was in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, waiting for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, that he and Achillas succeeded in reaching the pontiff, and interceded for the reinstatement of Arius, which Peter absolutely refused declaring that Arius was doomed to perdition. The refusal evidently had little effect, for when Achillas succeeded Peter, Arius was made a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; and when in turn Alexander came to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> was still tolerated. It is worth recording that the great <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> succeeded Alexander, the dying pontiff compelling the future <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">doctor of the Church</a> to accept the post. Alexander is described as "a man held in the highest <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> by the people and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, magnificent, liberal, eloquent, just, a lover of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man, devoted to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, good and sweet to all, so <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortified</a> that he never broke his <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a> while the sun was in the heavens." His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 17 April.
