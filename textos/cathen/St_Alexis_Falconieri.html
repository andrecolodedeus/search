<h1>St. Alexis Falconieri</h1>  

<p>Born in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 1200; died 17 February, 1310, at Mount Senario, near Florence. He was the son of Bernard Falconieri, a merchant prince of Florence, and one of the leaders of the Republic. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> belonged to the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a> party, and opposed the Imperialists whenever they could consistently with their political principles. Alexis grew up in the practice of the most profound <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. He joined the <em>Laudesi</em>, a <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">pious confraternity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, and there met the six future companions of his life of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. He was favoured with an <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">apparition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, 15 August, 1233, as were these companions. The seven soon afterwards founded the Order of the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a>. With consistent loyalty and heroism Alexis at one abandoned all, and retired to La Camarzia, a house on the outskirts of the town, and the following year to Mt. Senario. With characteristic <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, he traversed, as a <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant</a>, in quest of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> for his brethren, the streets of the city through which he had lately moved as a prominent citizen. So deep and sincere was him <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> that, though he lived to the great age of hundred and ten years, he always refused to enter the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, of which he deemed himself unworthy. The <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of our <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">Saint</a> were confined principally to the material needs of the various communities in which he lived. In 1252 the new church at Cafaggio, on the outskirts of Florence, was completed under his care, with the financial assistance of Chiarissimo Falconieri. The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> image of the <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation</a>, still highly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, had its origin here. <a href="../cathen/08556a.htm">St. Juliana Falconieri</a>, his niece, was trained in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> under his personal direction. The influence exerted on his countrymen by Alexis and his companions may be gathered from the fact that in a few years ten thousand <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> had enrolled themselves under the banner of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servite</a> Order. At his death he was visited by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Infant Jesus</a> in visible form, as was attested by eyewitnesses. His body rests near the church of the Annunciation, in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>. <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> declared Alexis worthy of the veneration of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, 1 December, 1717, and accorded the same <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to his six companions, 3 July 1725.
