<h1>St. Aloysius Gonzaga</h1>  

<p>Born in the castle of Castiglione, 9 March, 1568; died 21 June, 1591. At eight he was placed in the court of Francesco de'Medici in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, where he remained for two years, going then to Mantua. At <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>, when he was twelve, he came under the spiritual guidance of <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>, and from him received First Communion. In 1581 he went with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and he and his brother were made pages of James, the son of Philip II. While there he formed the resolution of becoming a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, though he first thought of joining the Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>. He returned to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in 1584 after the death of the Infanta, and after much difficulty in securing his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> consent, renounced his heritage in favour of his brother, 2 November, 1585, a proceeding which required the approval of the emperor, as Castiglione was a fief of the empire. He presented himself to Father Claudius Acquaviva, who was then General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, 25 November, 1585. Before the end of his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, he passed a brilliant public act in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, having made his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and also his mathematical studies before his entrance. He had in fact distinguished himself, when in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, by a public examination not only in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, but also in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, at the <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">University of Alcal&aacute;</a>. He made his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> 25 November, 1587. Immediately after, he began his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies. Among his professors were Fathers Vasquez and Azor. In 1591 when in his fourth year of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> a famine and pestilence broke out in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Though in delicate health, he devoted himself to the care of the sick, but on March 3 he fell ill and died 21 June, 1591. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a> in 1621 and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> in 1726. His remains are in the church of St. Ignazio in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in a magnificent urn of lapis lazuli wreathed with festoons of silver. The altar has for its centerpiece a large marble relief of the Saint by Le Gros.
