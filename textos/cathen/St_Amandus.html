<h1>St. Amandus</h1>  

<p>One of the great apostles of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>; born near <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, about the end of the sixth century. He was, apparently, of noble extraction. When a youth of twenty, he fled from his home and became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> near <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, resisting all the efforts of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to withdraw him from his mode of life. Following what he regarded as divine inspiration, he betook himself to <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, where under the direction of St. Austregisile, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city, he remained in solitude for fifteen years, living in a cell and subsisting on bread and water. After a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> as a missionary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at the age of thirty-three. At the request of Clotaire II, he began first to evangelize the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, who were then degraded <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolaters</a>, and afterwards extended his work throughout all <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, suffering <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and undergoing great hardship but achieving nothing, until the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of restoring the life of a criminal who had been hanged, changed the feelings of the people to reverence and affection and brought many converts to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Monasteries at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a> and Mt. Blandin were erected. They were the first monuments to the Faith in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. Returning to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in 630, he incurred the enmity of King Dagobert, who he had endeavoured to recall from a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> life, and was expelled from the kingdom. Dagobert afterwards entreated him to return, asked pardon for the wrong done, and requested him to be tutor of the heir of the throne. The danger of living at court prompted the Saint to refuse the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. His next apostolate was among of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> of the Danube, but it met with no success, and we find him then in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, reporting to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> what results had been achieved.

<p>While returning to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> he is said to have calmed a storm at sea. He was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maastricht about the year 649, but unable the repress the disorders of the place, he appealed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/09723c.htm">Martin I</a>, for instructions. The reply traced his plan of action with regard to fractious <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and also contained information about the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelite heresy</a>, which was then desolating the East. Amandus was also commissioned to convoke councils in Neustria and Austrasia in order to have the decrees which had been passed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> read to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Gaul, who in turn commissioned him to bear the acts of their councils to the Sovereign Pontiff. He availed himself of this occasion to obtain his release from the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> of Maastricht, and to resume his work as a missionary. It was at this time that he entered into relations with the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Pepin of Landen, and helped St. Gertrude and St. Itta to establish their famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Nivelles. Thirty years before he had gone into the Basque country to preach, but had met with little success. He was now requested by the inhabitants to return, and although seventy years old, he undertook the work of evangelizing them and appears to have banished <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> from the land. Returning again to his country, he founded several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, on one occasion at the risk of his life. <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> especially boasts many of his foundations. Dagobert made great concessions to him for his various establishments. He died in his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Elnon, at the age of ninety. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept 6 February.
