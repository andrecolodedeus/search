<h1>St. Anastasia</h1>  

<p>This <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> enjoys the distinction, unique in the Roman liturgy, of having a special commemoration in the second Mass on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas day</a>. This Mass was originally celebrated not in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but in commemoration of this <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, and towards the end of the fifth century her name was also inserted in the Roman <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">canon of the Mass</a>. Nevertheless, she is not a Roman saint, for she suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a>, and was not <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> until almost the end of the fifth century. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that a later legend, not earlier than the sixth century, makes Anastasia a Roman, though even in this legend she did not suffer <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The same legend connects her name with that of <a href="../cathen/03742b.htm">St. Chrysogonus</a>, likewise not a Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, but <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> in <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, though he had a church in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> dedicated to his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. According to this "Passio", Anastasia was the daughter of Praetextatus, a Roman <em>vir illustris</em>, and had Chrysogonus for a teacher. Early in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> the <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Emperor</a> summoned Chrysogonus to Aquileia where he suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Anastasia, having gone from <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> to <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a> to visit the faithful of that place, was beheaded on the island of Palmaria, 25 December, and her body <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the house of Apollonia, which had been converted into a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a>. The whole account is purely legendary, and rests on no historical foundations. All that is certain is that a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> named Anastasia gave her life for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a>, and that her memory was kept sacred in that church. The so-called "Martyrologium Sieronymianum" (ed. <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> and Duchesne, Acta SS., 2 November) records her name on 25 December, not for <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a> alone, but also for Constantinople, a circumstance based on a separate story. According to Theodorus Lector (Hist. Eccles., II, 65), during the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> of <a href="../cathen/06416b.htm">Gennadius</a> (458-471) the body of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> was transferred to Constantinople and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in a church which had hitherto been known as "Anastasis" (Gr. <em>Anastasis</em>, Resurrection); thenceforth the church took the name of Anastasia. Similarly the cultus of St. Anastasia was introduced into Roman from <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a> by means of an already existing church. As this church was already quite famous, it brought the feast of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> into especial prominence. There existed in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> from the fourth century, at the foot of the Palatine and above the Circus Maximus, a church which had been adorned by Pope Damasus (366-384) with a large <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a>. It was known as "titulus Anastasix", and is mentioned as such in the Acts of the Roman Council of 499. There is some uncertainty as to the origin of this name; either the church owes its foundation to and was named after a Roman matron Anastasia, as in the case of several other titular churches of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Duchesne), or it was originally an "Anastasis" church (dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of Christ</a>), such as existed already at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> and Constantinople; from the word "Anastasis" came eventually the name "titulus Anastasix" (Grisar). Whatever way this happened, the church was an especially prominent one from the fourth to the sixth century, being the only titular church in the centre of ancient <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and surrounded by the monuments of the city's <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> past. Within its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> was the Palatine where the imperial court was located. Since the veneration of the <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmian</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, Anastasia, received a new impetus in Constantinople during the second half of the fifth century, we may easily infer that the intimate contemporary relations between Old and New Rome brought about an increase in devotion to St. Anastasia at the foot of the Palatine. At all events the insertion of her name into the Roman Canon of the Mass towards the end of the fifth century, show that she then occupied a unique position among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> publicly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Thenceforth the church on the Palatine is known as "titulus sanctx Anastasix", and the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a> became the titular saint of the old fourth-century basilica. Evidently because of its position as titular church of the district including the imperial dwellings on the Palatine this church long maintained an eminent rank among the churches of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; only two churches preceded it in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>: St. John Lateran, the mother-church of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and St. Mary Major. This ancient sanctuary stands today quite isolated amid the ruins of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The commemoration of St. Anastasia in the second Mass on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas day</a> is the last remnant of the former prominence enjoyed by this saint and her church in the life of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.
