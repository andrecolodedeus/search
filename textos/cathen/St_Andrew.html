<h1>St. Andrew</h1>  

<p>The name "Andrew" (Gr., <em>andreia</em>, manhood, or valour), like other Greek names, appears to have been common among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from the second or third century B.C.

<p>St. Andrew, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a>, son of Jonah, or John (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs17">Matthew 16:17</a>; <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs42">John 1:42</a>), was born in <a href="../cathen/02536a.htm">Bethsaida</a> of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs44">John 1:44</a>). He was brother of Simon (Peter) (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs2">Matthew 10:2</a>; <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs40">John 1:40</a>). Both were fishermen (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#vrs18">Matthew 4:18</a>; <a href="../bible/mar001.htm#vrs16">Mark 1:16</a>), and at the beginning of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> public life occupied the same house at <a href="../cathen/03309a.htm">Capharnaum</a> (<a href="../bible/mar001.htm#vrs21">Mark 1:21, 29</a>).

<p>From the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">fourth Gospel</a> we learn that Andrew was a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the Baptist, whose testimony first led him and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John the Evangelist</a> to follow <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs35">John 1:35-40</a>). Andrew at once recognized <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> as the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, and hastened to introduce Him to his brother, Peter, (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs41">John 1:41</a>). Thenceforth the two brothers were <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. On a subsequent occasion, prior to the final call to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostolate</a>, they were called to a closer companionship, and then they left all things to follow <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> (<a href="../bible/luk005.htm#vrs11">Luke 5:11</a>; <a href="../bible/mat004.htm#vrs19">Matthew 4:19-20</a>; <a href="../bible/mar001.htm#vrs17">Mark 1:17-18</a>).

<p>Finally Andrew was chosen to be one of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve</a>; and in the various lists of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> given in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs2">Matthew 10:2-4</a>); <a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs16">Mark 3:16-19</a>; <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#vrs14">Luke 6:14-16</a>; <a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs13">Acts 1:13</a>) he is always numbered among the first four. The only other explicit reference to him in the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptists</a> occurs in <a href="../bible/mar013.htm#vrs3">Mark 13:3</a>, where we are told he joined with Peter, James and John in putting the question that led to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> great <a href="../cathen/05528b.htm">eschatological</a> discourse. In addition to this scanty information, we learn from the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">fourth Gospel</a> that on the occasion of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> feeding of the five thousand, it was Andrew who said: "There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fishes: but what are these among so many?" (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#vrs8">John 6:8-9</a>); and when, a few days before <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Our Lord's death</a>, certain Greeks asked Philip that they might see <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, Philip referred the matter to Andrew as to one of greater authority, and then both told <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/joh012.htm#vrs20">John 12:20-22</a>). Like the majority of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve</a>, Andrew is not named in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Acts</a> except in the list of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, where the order of the first four is Peter, John, James, Andrew; nor have the Epistles or the <a href="../cathen/01594b.htm">Apocalypse</a> any mention of him.

<p>From what we know of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> generally, we can, of course, supplement somewhat these few details. As one of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve</a>, Andrew was admitted to the closest familiarity with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> during His public life; he was present at the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a>; beheld the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">risen Lord</a>; <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnessed</a> the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>; shared in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the first Pentecost, and helped, amid threats and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, to establish the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> in Palestine.

<p>When the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> went forth to preach to the Nations, Andrew seems to have taken an important part, but unfortunately we have no <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> as to the extent or place of his labours. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.1</a>), relying, apparently, upon <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, assigns Scythia as his mission field: <em>Andras de [eilechen] ten Skythian</em>; while <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a> (<a href="../fathers/310233.htm">Oration 33</a>) mentions Epirus; <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (Ep. ad Marcell.) <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaia</a>; and <a href="../cathen/14574b.htm">Theodoret</a> (on Ps. cxvi) Hellas. Probably these various accounts are correct, for <a href="../cathen/11050a.htm">Nicephorus</a> (H.E. II:39), relying upon early writers, states that Andrew preached in Cappadocia, Galatia, and Bithynia, then in the land of the anthropophagi and the Scythian <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">deserts</a>, afterwards in <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">Byzantium</a> itself, where he appointed St. Stachys as its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and finally in Thrace, <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>, Thessaly, and <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaia</a>. It is generally agreed that he was crucified by order of the Roman Governor, Aegeas or Aegeates, at Patrae in <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaia</a>, and that he was bound, not nailed, to the cross, in order to prolong his sufferings. The cross on which he suffered is commonly held to have been the decussate cross, now known as St. Andrew's, though the evidence for this view seems to be no older than the fourteenth century. His <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> took place during the reign of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, on 30 November, A.D. 60); and both the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> and Greek Churches keep 30 November as his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a>.

<p>St. Andrew's <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were translated from Patrae to Constantinople, and deposited in the church of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> there, about A.D. 357. When Constantinople was taken by the French, in the beginning of the thirteenth century, Cardinal Peter of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a> brought the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and placed them in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a>, where most of them still remain. St. Andrew is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as their chief <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron</a> by <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>.
