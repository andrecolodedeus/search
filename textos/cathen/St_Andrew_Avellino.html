<h1>St. Andrew Avellino</h1>  

<p>Born 1521 at Castronuovo, a small town in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>; died 10 November, 1608. His <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">baptismal name</a> was Lancelotto, which out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the cross he changed into Andrew when he entered the Order of <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a>. From his early youth he was a great lover of chastity. After receiving his elementary training in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Castronuovo, he was sent to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> to pursue a course in the humanities and in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Being a handsome youth, his chastity was often exposed to danger from <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> admirers, and to escape their importunities he took <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">ecclesiastical tonsure</a>. Hereupon he went to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> to study canon and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, obtained the degree of Doctor of Laws and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at the age of twenty-six. For some time he held the office of lawyer at the <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical court</a> of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. One day, while pleading the cause of a friend, a lie escaped his lips in the heat of argument. When, soon afterwards, his eyes fell upon the passage in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, "The mouth that belieth killeth the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>" (<a href="../bible/wis001.htm">Wisdom 1:11</a>), he felt deep remorse, renounced his profession as <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> lawyer and for some time devoted himself entirely to holy meditation and other spiritual exercises. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> now commissioned him to reform a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, which by the laxity of its <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> had become a source of great <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. By his own example and his untiring <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> he restored the religious discipline of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> but not without many and great difficulties. Certain wicked men who were accustomed to have clandestine meetings with the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> became exasperated at the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> interference, and one night he was assaulted and severely wounded. He was brought to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a> to recuperate. Here, however, he resolved to devote himself entirely to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and he entered the Order of <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a>, which had but recently been founded by St. Cajetan. On the vigil of the Assumption he was invested, being then thirty-five years of age. After completing his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, he obtained permission to visit the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the Apostles and the Martyrs at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and, upon his return was made master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>. After holding this office ten years he was elected superior. His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for strict religious discipline, and for the purity of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, as well as his deep <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and sincere <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> induced the General of his Order to entrust him with the foundation of two new <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatine</a> houses, one at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, the other at <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>. By his efforts many more <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatine</a> houses rose up in various diocese of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. As superior of some of these new foundations he was so successful in converting sinners and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> by his <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in the direction of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and by his eloquent preaching, that numerous disciples thronged around him, eager to be under his spiritual guidance. One of the most noteworthy of his disciples was Lorenzo Scupoli, the author of that still popular book "The Spiritual Combat". <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> was an intimate friend of <a href="../cathen/02149c.htm">Avellino</a> and sought his advice in the most important affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Through indefatigable in preaching, hearing <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a>, and visiting the sick, <a href="../cathen/02149c.htm">Avellino</a> still had time to write some <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> works. His letters were published in 1731, at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, in two volumes, and his other <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> works, three years later in five volumes. On 10 November, 1608, when beginning the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a>, he was stricken with apoplexy, and after devoutly receiving the <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">Holy Viaticum</a>, died the death of a saint at the age of eighty-eight. In 1624, only sixteen years after his death, he was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, and in 1712 was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>. He is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as patron by <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and invoked especially against a sudden death. His earthly remains lie buried in the Church of St. Paul at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>.
