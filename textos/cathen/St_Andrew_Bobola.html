<h1>St. Andrew Bobola</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a>, born of an old and illustrious Polish <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, in the Palatinate of <a href="../cathen/13436b.htm">Sandomir</a>, 1590; died at Jan&oacute;w, 16 May, 1657. Having entered the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at Wilno (1611), he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1622, and appointed preacher in the Church of St. Casimir, Wilno. After making his solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, 2 June, 1630, he was made superior at Bobruisk, where he wrought wonders by his preaching and distinguished himself by his devotion during an epidemic of the plague. In 1636 he began his work in the Lithuanian missions. During this period <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> was being ravaged by Cossacks, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russians</a>, and Tatars, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> was made the object of the concerted attacks of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and schismatics. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, in particular, had much to endure. Bobola's success in converting schismatics drew upon him the rage of those in high authority, and the adherents of the Greek Pope decided to centralize their forces in Polesia. A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> nobleman of this province offered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> a house at Pinsk, and here Father Bobola was stationed. The schismatics vainly endeavoured in every manner to hinder him in the exercise of his apostolic <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, extending their persecutions to attacks upon his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. On 16 May, 1657, he was seized by two Cossacks and severely beaten. Then tying him to their saddles, they dragged him to Jan&oacute;w where he was subjected to incredible tortures. After having been burned, half strangled, and partly flayed alive, he was released from suffering by a sabre stroke. His body was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the collegiate church of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> at Pinsk, where it became the object of great veneration. It was later transferred to Polosk, where it is still held in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, even by the schismatics. Father Bobola was declared Blessed by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1853, and his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, 23 May.

<p>[<em>Note:</em> Andrew Bobola was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Pope Pius XII with his encyclical "Invicti Athletae" <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> on May 16, 1957.]
