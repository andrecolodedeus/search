<h1>St. Andrew Corsini</h1>  

<p>Of the illustrious <a href="../cathen/01472d.htm">Corsini</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; born in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, in 1302; died 1373. Wild and dissolute in youth, he was startled by the words of his mother about what had happened to her before his birth, and, becoming a <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in his native city, began a life of great <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>. He studied at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and, on his return, became the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> of Florence. He was regarded as a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> and a thaumaturgus. Called to the <a href="../cathen/06070a.htm">See of Fiesoli</a>, he fled, but was discovered by a child, and compelled to accept the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. He redoubled his austerities as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was lavish in his care of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and was sought for everywhere as a peacemaker, notably at Bologna, whither he was sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to heal the breach between the nobility and the people. After twelve years in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a>, he died at the age of seventy-one, and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were so multiplied at his death that <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a> permitted a public cult immediately; but it was only in 1629 that <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> him. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 4 February.
