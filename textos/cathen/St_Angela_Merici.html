<h1>St. Angela Merici</h1>  

<p>Foundress of the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, born 21 March, 1474, at Desenzano, a small town on the southwestern shore of Lake Garda in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>; died 27 January, 1540, at <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>.

<p>She was left an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> at the age of ten and together with her elder sister came to the home of her uncle at the neighbouring town of Salo where they led an angelic life. When her sister met with a sudden death, without being able to receive the last <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, young Angela was much distressed. She became a <a href="../cathen/14520b.htm">tertiary</a> of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a> and greatly increased her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortifications</a> for the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">repose</a> of her sister's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. In her anguish and pious simplicity she <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">reveal</a> to her the condition of her deceased sister. It is said that by a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> she was satisfied her sister was in the company of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p>When she was twenty years old, her uncle died, and she returned to her paternal home at Desenzano. Convinced that the great need of her times was a better <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">instruction</a> of young girls in the rudiments of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, she converted her home into a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> where at stated intervals she daily gathered all the little girls of Desenzano and taught them the elements of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. It is related that one day, while in an <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>, she had a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> in which it was <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">revealed</a> to her that she was to found an association of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who were to devote their lives to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">religious training</a> of young girls. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> she had established at Desenzano soon bore abundant fruit, and she was invited to the neighbouring city, <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>, to establish a similar <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at that place. Angela gladly accepted the invitation.

<p>In 1524, while making a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the Holy Land, she became suddenly blind when she was on the island of Crete, but continued her journey to the Holy Places and was cured on her return while <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> before a <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">crucifix</a> at the same place where she was struck with blindness a few weeks before. When, in the <a href="../cathen/08531c.htm">jubilee year</a> 1525, she had come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to gain the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Pope Clement VII</a>, who had heard of her great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and her extraordinary success as a religious teacher of young girls, invited her to remain in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; but Angela, who shunned publicity, returned to <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>. Finally, on the 25th of November, 1535, Angela chose twelve <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> and laid the foundation of the order of the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> in a small house near the Church of St. Afra in <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>. Having been five years superior of the newly-founded order, she died.

<p>Her <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">body</a> lies <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the Church of St. Afra at <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>. She was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> in 1768, by <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1807, by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>. Her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated 31 May. <span class="stiki"><em>Note:</em> After this article was written, her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> was moved to 27 January.</span>
