<h1>St. Anne</h1>  

<p>Anne (Hebrew, <em>Hannah</em>, grace; also spelled <em>Ann, Anne, Anna</em>) is the traditional name of the mother of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a>.

<p>All our information concerning the names and lives of Sts. <a href="../cathen/08406b.htm">Joachim</a> and Anne, the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, is derived from <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal literature</a>, the Gospel of the Nativity of Mary, the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew and the <em>Protoevangelium</em> of James. Though the earliest form of the latter, on which directly or indirectly the other two seem to be based, goes back to about A.D. 150, we can hardly accept as beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> its various statements on its sole authority. In the Orient the Protoevangelium had great authority and portions of it were read on the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feasts</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> by the Greeks, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a>, <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabians</a>. In the Occident, however, it was rejected by the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> until its contents were incorporated by <a href="../cathen/08262b.htm">Jacobus de Voragine</a> in his "Golden Legend" in the thirteenth century. From that time on the story of St. Anne spread over the West and was amply developed, until St. Anne became one of the most popular <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> also of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>.

<p>The Protoevangelium gives the following account: In <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a> there lived a <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">rich</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> couple, Joachim and Hannah. They were childless. When on a <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a> Joachim presented himself to offer sacrifice in the temple, he was repulsed by a certain <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a>, under the pretext that men without offspring were unworthy to be admitted. Whereupon Joachim, bowed down with grief, did not return home, but went into the mountains to make his plaint to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in solitude. Also Hannah, having learned the reason of the prolonged absence of her husband, cried to the Lord to take away from her the curse of sterility, promising to dedicate her child to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were heard; an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> came to Hannah and said: "Hannah, the Lord has looked upon thy tears; thou shalt conceive and give birth and the fruit of thy womb shall be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> by all the world". The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> made the same promise to Joachim, who returned to his wife. Hannah gave birth to a daughter whom she called Miriam (Mary). Since this story is apparently a reproduction of the <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">biblical</a> account of the conception of <a href="../cathen/08647b.htm">Samuel</a>, whose mother was also called Hannah, even the name of the mother of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> seems to be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>.

<p>The renowned <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Father John of Eck</a> of <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>, in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermon</a> on St. Anne (published at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1579), pretends to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> even the names of the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> St. Anne. He calls them Stollanus and Emerentia. He says that St. Anne was born after Stollanus and Emerentia had been childless for twenty years; that <a href="../cathen/08406b.htm">St. Joachim</a> died soon after the presentation of Mary in the temple; that St. Anne then married <a href="../cathen/04048b.htm">Cleophas</a>, by whom she became the mother of <a href="../cathen/09748b.htm">Mary Cleophae</a> (the wife of Alphaeus and mother of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> James the Lesser, Simon and <a href="../cathen/08542b.htm">Judas</a>, and of Joseph the Just); after the death of Cleophas she is said to have married Salomas, to whom she bore Maria Salomae (the wife of Zebedaeus and mother of the Apostles John and James the Greater). The same spurious legend is found in the writings of <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a> (Opp. III, 59) and of many others. There arose in the sixteenth century an animated controversy over the marriages of St. Anne, in which <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> and <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> defended her monogamy. The Greek <a href="../cathen/10177b.htm">Menaea</a> (25 July) call the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of St. Anne Mathan and Maria, and relate that Salome and Elizabeth, the mother of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>, were daughters of two sisters of St. Anne. According to Ephiphanius it was maintained even in the fourth century by some enthusiasts that St. Anne conceived without the action of man. This <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> was revived in the West in the fifteenth century. (<em>Anna concepit per osculum Joachimi.</em>) In 1677 the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> condemned the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of Imperiali who taught that St. Anne in the conception and birth of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> remained <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> (<a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, De Festis, II, 9). In the Orient the cult of St. Anne can be traced to the fourth century. <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Justinian I</a> (d. 565) had a church dedicated to her. The canon of the Greek Office of St. Anne was composed by <a href="../cathen/14623a.htm">St. Theophanes</a> (d. 817), but older parts of the Office are ascribed to Anatolius of Byzantium (d. 458). Her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated in the East on the 25th day of July, which may be the day of the dedication of her first church at Constantinople or the anniversary of the arrival of her supposed <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> in Constantinople (710). It is found in the oldest <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> document of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, the Calendar of Constantinople (first half of the eighth century). The Greeks keep a collective feast of St. Joachim and St. Anne on the 9th of September. In the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> St. Anne was not <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>, except, perhaps, in the south of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, before the thirteenth century. Her picture, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in the eighth century, which was found lately in the church of Santa Maria Antiqua in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, owes its origin to Byzantine influence. Her feast, under the influence of the "Golden Legend", is first found (26 July) in the thirteenth century, e.g. at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> (in 1291), where a foot of St. Anne was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> (feast of translation, 16 September). It was introduced in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> by <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>, 21 November, 1378, from which time it spread all over the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>. It was extended to the universal <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> in 1584.

<p>The supposed <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Anne were brought from the Holy Land to Constantinople in 710 and were still kept there in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Sophia in 1333. The <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> of the church of Apt in southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> pretends that the body of St. Anne was brought to Apt by St. Lazarus, the friend of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, was hidden by St. Auspicius (d. 398), and found again during the reign of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> (feast, Monday after the <a href="../cathen/11204a.htm">octave</a> of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>); these <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were brought to a magnificent <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in 1664 (feast, 4 May). The head of St. Anne was kept at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> up to 1510, when it was <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">stolen</a> and brought to D&uuml;ren in Rheinland. St. Anne is the <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patroness</a> of Brittany. Her <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> picture (feast, 7 March) is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> at Notre Dame d'Auray, <a href="../cathen/15271b.htm">Diocese of Vannes</a>. Also in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, where she is the principal patron of the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">province of Quebec</a>, the shrine of <a href="../cathen/01539b.htm">St. Anne de Beaupr&eacute;</a> is well known. St. Anne is patroness of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in labour; she is represented holding the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a> in her lap, who again carries on her arm the child <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. She is also patroness of miners, Christ being compared to gold, Mary to silver.
