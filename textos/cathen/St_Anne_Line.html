<h1>St. Anne Line</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05474a.htm">English martyr</a>, d. 27 Feb., 1601. She was the daughter of William Heigham of Dunmow, Essex, a gentleman of means and an ardent <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a>, and when she and her brother announced their intention of becoming <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> both were disowned and disinherited. Anne married Roger Line, a convert like herself, and shortly after their marriage he was apprehended for attending Mass. After a brief confinement he was released and permitted to go into exile in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, where he died in 1594. When <a href="../cathen/06466c.htm">Father John Gerard</a> established a house of refuge for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, Mrs. Line was placed in charge. After <a href="../cathen/06466c.htm">Father Gerard's</a> escape from the Tower in 1597, as the authorities were beginning to suspect her assistance, she removed to another house, which she made a rallying point for neighbouring <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. On <a href="../cathen/03245b.htm">Candlemas Day</a>, 1601, Father Francis Page, S.J. was about to celebrate <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in her apartments, when priest-catchers broke into the rooms. Father Page quickly unvested, and mingled with the others, but the altar prepared for the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> was all the evidence needed for the arrest of Mrs. Line. She was tried at the Old Bailey 26 Feb., 1601, and indicted under the Act of 27 Eliz. for harbouring a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, though this could not be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. The next day she was led to the gallows, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravely</a> proclaiming her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, achieved the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> for which she had <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>. Her fate was shared by two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/02296c.htm">[Bl.] Mark Barkworth, O.S.B.</a>, and Roger Filcock, S.J., who were executed at the same time.

<p>Roger Filcock had long been Mrs. Line's friend and frequently her confessor. Entering the English College at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> in 1588, he was sent with the others in 1590 to colonize the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/13329a.htm">St. Albans</a> at <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, and, after completing his course there, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> and sent on the English mission. Father Garnett kept him on probation for two years to try his mettle before admitting him to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, and finding him <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a>, finally allowed him to enter. He was just about to cross to the Continent for his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> when he was arrested on suspicion of being a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and executed after a travesty of a trial.

<p>[<em>Note:</em> In 1970, Anne Line was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Pope Paul VI among the Forty Martyrs of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, whose joint feast day is kept on 25 October.]
