<h1>St. Anno</h1>  

<p>(Or HANNO).

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a> in 1055. When very young he entered the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>, under the guidance of his uncle, a canon of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>. He had formerly adopted the profession of arms. His attainments both in sacred and profane learning, as well as his unusual virtue, attracted the attention of the <a href="../cathen/07228a.htm">Emperor Henry III</a> who called him to court. He is said to have been a man of remarkably handsome presence and of rare eloquence and in a very special way adapted for great undertakings. A lover of right and justice, he defended them fearlessly in all circumstances. He was made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> was a scene of unwonted splendour, though very trying to him, as he accepted the office with the greatest repugnance. At the death of Henry, the Empress Agnes made him regent of the empire, and entrusted him with the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the young prince, afterwards Henry IV, who had already been corrupted by the flatterers who surrounded him. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop's</a> strictness was soon found to be distasteful to the prince, and he was deprived of his office of regent, but the disorders which followed on account of the exactions and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> of those who were attached to Henry became so unbearable that in 1072 Anno again resumed the reins of government.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at that time was torn by the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a> of <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipopes</a>. Anno joined with <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a> and <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a> in the work of order and reformation. <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a>, however, speaks of "the discontent of the court of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> because of the frequent sharp reprehensions addressed to the powerful Anno by <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Pope Nicholas II</a>" (Hist. de L'&eacute;glise, III, 283). It was probably because of a plea for more power to be given to the German emperors in papal elections. The feeling was so bitter in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> that a union was made with the bad elements of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and an <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/03128c.htm">Cadalus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, was put forward. The rightful Pope, at the time, was <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a>. At a great assembly held at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> in 1062, Anno pronounced a discourse in favour of Alexander; the Empress Agnes had been won over by <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a>; but the influence of the Adalbert, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>-Bremen, and others prevailed to such an extent that it was impossible to separate <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> altogether from <a href="../cathen/03128c.htm">Cadalus</a>, who, however, died four years later. According to <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a> (Hist. de l'&eacute;glise, III, 377), the autocratic nepotism of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, so common then, was shared by Anno, and he instances the giving of the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> to his nephew Cunon, who because of it was assassinated shortly after his appointment. Whether or not this be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the cares of state did not prevent Anno from fulfilling his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. His <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was continuous, his austerities extreme, his preaching incessant, his charity inexhaustible. He reformed all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and established five new ones for the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> and <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>. He died 4 December, 1075, and was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> shortly afterwards.
