<h1>St. Anschar</h1>  

<p>(Or ANSGARIUS.)

<p>Called the Apostle of the North, was b. in Picardy, 8 September, 801; d. 5 February, 865. He became a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> of Corbie, whence lie passed into <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>. With Harold, the newly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> King of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> who had been expelled from his kingdom but was now returning, he and Autbert went to preach the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> in that country where Ebbo, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, had already laboured but without much success. Anschar founded a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/13542a.htm">Schleswig</a>, but the intemperate <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Harold provoked another storm which ended in a second expulsion, and the consequent return of the missionaries. In the company of the ambassadors of Louis le D&eacute;bonnaire, he then entered Sweden, and preached the Gospel there. Although the embassy had been attacked on its way and had apparently abandoned its mission, Anschar succeeded in entering the country, and was favourably received by the king, who permitted him to preach. The chief of the royal counsellors, Herigar, was converted, and built the first church of Sweden. Anschar remained there a year and a half, and returning was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the new see of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, and appointed by <a href="../cathen/06789b.htm">Gregory IV</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of the northern nations. He revived also the abbey of Turholt in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, and established a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> there. In 845 Eric, the King of Jutland, appeared off Hamburg with a fleet of 600 vessels, and destroyed the city. Anschar was for some time a fugitive and was deprived also of his <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> possessions by Charles the Bald, but on the accession of Louis the German was restored to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a> which had been the See of Leudric, his enemy, was at the same time united to <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, but though the arrangement was made in 847 it was not confirmed by the Pope until 857, and Anschar was made the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Meantime he made frequent excursions to <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, ostensibly in the quality of envoy of King Louis. He built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> at <a href="../cathen/13542a.htm">Schleswig</a> and afterwards went as <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> ambassador to his old mission of <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>. King Olaf regarded him with favour, but the question of permitting him to preach was submitted to the oracles, which are said to have given a favourable answer. It was probably due to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. A church was built and a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> established there. In 854 we find him back in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, where he succeeded in changing the enmity of King Eric into friendship. Eric had expelled the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who had been left at <a href="../cathen/13542a.htm">Schleswig</a>, but at the request of Anschar recalled them. The saint built another church in Jutland and introduced the use of bells, which the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> regarded as instruments of magic, he also induced the king to mitigate the horrors of the slave-trade. He was eminent for his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, and observance of the monastic rule, he built <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, ransomed captives, sent immense <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> abroad, and regretted only that he had not been found worthy of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Though he wrote several works, very little of them remains. He had added devotional phrases to the psalms, which, according to <a href="../cathen/05745a.htm">Fabricius</a>, in his Latin Library of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, are an illustrious monument, to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>. He had also compiled a life of <a href="../cathen/15628a.htm">St. Willehad</a>, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, and the preface which he wrote was considered a masterpiece for that age. It is published by <a href="../cathen/05745a.htm">Fabricius</a> among the works of the historians of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>. Some letters of his are also extant. He is known in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> as St. Scharies and such is the title of his collegiate church in <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>. Another in Hamburg under the same title was converted into an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> by the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>. All of his success as a missionary he ascribed to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of Louis le D&eacute;bonnaire and the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a> of his predecessor in the work, Ebbo, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, who, however, as a matter of fact, had failed.
