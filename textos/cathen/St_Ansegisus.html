<h1>St. Ansegisus</h1>  

<p>Born about 770, of noble <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parentage</a>; died 20 July, 833, or 834. At the age of eighteen he entered the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Fontanelle (also called St. Vandrille after the name of its founder) in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>. St. Girowald, a relative of Ansegisus, was then <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Fontanelle. From the beginning of his monastic life St. Ansegisus manifested a deep <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> united with great learning, and upon the recommendation of the Abbot St. Girowald he was entrusted by the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Emperor Charlemagne</a> with the government and reform of two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, St. Sixtus near <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> and St. Memius (St. Mange) in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Challons-sur-Marne. Under the direction of St. Ansegisus these two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> soon regained their original splendour. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, being much pleased with the success of Ansegisus, appointed him <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Flay, or St. Germer, a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Diocese of Beauvais</a>, the buildings of which were threatening to fall into ruins. At the same time <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> made Ansegisus supervisor of royal works under the general direction of Abbot Einhard. Under the management of Ansegisus the structures of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Flay were completely renovated, monastic <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> was restored, and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were instructed in the sacred and the profane <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. Louis le D&eacute;bonnaire esteemed Ansegisus as highly as his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> had done and, seeing how all <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> flourished that had at one time been under the direction of Ansegisus, he put him at the head of the monastery of Luxeuil in the year 817. This <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was founded by St. Columban as early as 590 and, during the seventh and the first half of the eighth century, was the most renowned <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. Of late, however, its discipline had grown lax. Having restored this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to its former splendour, he was in 823, after the death of Abbot Einhard, transferred as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Fontanelle, where he had spent the early days of his monastic life. He immediately applied himself with vigour to restore monastic fervour by <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> exhortations and, most of all, by his own edifying example. Some learned and saintly <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> whom he invited from Luxeuil to Fontanelle assisted him in his great work of reform. Hand in hand with a reform of discipline came a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for learning. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was enriched with valuable books, such as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, some works of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede</a>, etc. The most learned of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were put to writing original works, while the others occupied themselves with transcribing valuable old books and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. In a short time the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of Fontanelle became one of the largest in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and acquired great renown for accuracy of transcribing and beauty of writing. A dormitory, a refectory, a chapter-house, a <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, and other new structures were erected at Fontanelle by St. Ansegisus. On account of his great learning and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> he was often sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to distant countries by Louis le D&eacute;bonnaire. The many and costly presents which he received as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> from foreign princes he distributed among various <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. While <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Fontanelle he wrote a "Constitutio pro monachis de victu et vestitu", in which he determines exactly how much food, what articles of dress, etc., the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were to receive from the different landed properties of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The work which made the name of Ansegisus renowned for all times is his collection of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and decrees made by the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Emperor Charlemagne</a> and his son Louis le D&eacute;bonnaire. These <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and decrees being divided into articles or chapters, are generally called "Capitulars". Ansegisus was the first to collect all those "Capitulars" into the four books entitled "Quatuor libri Capitularium Regum Francorum". The first and the second book contained all "Capitulars" relating to church affairs, while the third and the fourth books had all the "Capitulars" relating to state affairs. It was completed in the year 827. Shortly afterwards it was approved by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and remained for a long time the official book on civil and canon law. Shortly before his death Ansegisus was attacked by paralysis which ended his holy and useful life on 20 July, 833 or 834. His earthly remains lie buried in the Abbey of Fontanelle, where his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 20 July, the day of his death.
