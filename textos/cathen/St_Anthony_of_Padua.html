<h1>St. Anthony of Padua</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">Thaumaturgist</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, 1195; died at <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a> [actually Arcella --<em>Ed.</em>], 13 June, 1231. He received in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">name</a> of Ferdinand.

<p>Later writers of the fifteenth century asserted that his father was Martin Bouillon, descendant of the renowned <a href="../cathen/06624b.htm">Godfrey de Bouillon</a>, commander of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section1">First Crusade</a>, and his mother, Theresa Tavejra, descendant of Froila I, fourth king of Asturia. Unfortunately, however, his genealogy is uncertain; all that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> is that they were noble, powerful, and God-fearing people, and at the time of Ferdinand's birth were both still young, and living near the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>.

<p>Having been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, Ferdinand, at the age of fifteen, joined the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular of St. Augustine</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Vincent, just outside the city walls (1210). Two years later to avoid being distracted by relatives and friends, who frequently came to visit him, he betook himself with permission of his superior to the Convent of Santa Croce in <a href="../cathen/04095b.htm">C&oacute;imbra</a> (1212), where he remained for eight years, occupying his time mainly with study and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Gifted with an excellent understanding and a prodigious <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, he soon gathered from the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Sacred Scriptures</a> and the writings of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Holy Fathers</a> a treasure of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p>In the year 1220, having seen conveyed into the Church of Santa Croce the bodies of the first <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, who had suffered death at <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a>, 16 January of the same year, he too was inflamed with the desire of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and resolved to become a <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friar Minor</a>, that he might preach the Faith to the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> and suffer for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake. Having confided his intention to some of the brethren of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Olivares (near <a href="../cathen/04095b.htm">C&oacute;imbra</a>), who came to beg <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> at the Abbey of the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a>, he received from their hands the Franciscan habit in the same Convent of Santa Croce. Thus Ferdinand left the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular of St. Augustine</a> to join the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Order of Friars Minor</a>, taking at the same time the new name of Anthony, a name which later on the Convent of Olivares also adopted.

<p>A short time after his entry into the order, Anthony started for <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a>, but, stricken down by a severe illness, which affected him the entire winter, he was compelled to sail for <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> the following spring, 1221. His ship, however, was overtaken by a violent storm and driven upon the coast of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, where Anthony then remained for some time, till he had regained his health. Having heard meanwhile from the brethren of <a href="../cathen/10216a.htm">Messina</a> that a general chapter was to be held at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, 30 May, he journeyed thither, arriving in time to take part in it. The chapter over, Anthony remained entirely unnoticed.

<p>"He said not a word of his studies", writes his earliest biographer, "nor of the services he had performed; his only desire was to follow <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> and Him crucified". Accordingly, he applied to Father Graziano, <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">Provincial</a> of <a href="../cathen/04095b.htm">C&oacute;imbra</a>, for a place where he could live in solitude and penance, and enter more fully into the spirit and discipline of Franciscan life. Father Graziano, being just at that time in need of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for the hermitage of Montepaolo (near <a href="../cathen/06137a.htm">Forli</a>), sent him thither, that he might celebrate <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> for the <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay-brethren</a>.

<p>While Anthony lived retired at Montepaolo it happened, one day, that a number of Franciscan and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> were sent together to <a href="../cathen/06137a.htm">Forli</a> for <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>. Anthony was also present, but simply as companion of the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">Provincial</a>. When the time for <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> had arrived, it was found that no one had been appointed to preach. The superior turned first to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, and asked that one of their number should address a few words to the assembled brethren; but everyone declined, saying he was not prepared. In their emergency they then chose Anthony, whom they thought only able to read the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> and <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, and commanded him to speak whatever the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of God</a> might put into his mouth. Anthony, compelled by obedience, spoke at first slowly and timidly, but soon enkindled with fervour, he began to explain the most hidden sense of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> with such profound erudition and sublime <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that all were struck with astonishment. With that moment began Anthony's public career.

<p><a href="../cathen/06208a.htm">St. Francis</a>, informed of his learning, directed him by the following letter to teach theology to the brethren:

<blockquote><p>To Brother Anthony, my <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (i.e. teacher of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred sciences</a>), Brother Francis sends his greetings. It is my pleasure that thou teach <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brethren</a>, provided, however, that as the Rule prescribes, the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and devotion may not be extinguished. Farewell. (1224) </p></blockquote>

<p>Before undertaking the instruction, Anthony went for some time to <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>, to confer with the famous Abbot, Thomas Gallo; thence he taught successively in Bologna and <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a> in 1224, and later at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. Nothing whatever is left of his instruction; the primitive documents, as well as the legendary ones, maintain complete silence on this point. Nevertheless, by studying his works, we can form for ourselves a sufficient <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the character of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>; a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, namely, which, leaving aside all arid speculation, prefers an entirely seraphic character, corresponding to the spirit and ideal of <a href="../cathen/06208a.htm">St. Francis</a>.

<p>It was as an orator, however, rather than as professor, that Anthony reaped his richest harvest. He possessed in an eminent degree all the good qualities that characterize an eloquent preacher: a loud and clear voice, a winning countenance, wonderful <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, and profound learning, to which were added from on high the spirit of prophecy and an extraordinary <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">gift of miracles</a>. With the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of an apostle he undertook to reform the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a> of his time by combating in an especial manner the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of luxury, <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, and tyranny. The fruit of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> was, therefore, as admirable as his eloquence itself. No less fervent was he in the extinction of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, notably that of the <a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">Cathares and the Patarines</a>, which infested the centre and north of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and probably also that of the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a> in the south of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, though we have no authorized documents to that effect. Among the many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> St. Anthony wrought in the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; the three most noted recorded by his biographers are the following:

<ul><li>The first is that of a horse, which, kept <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> for three days, refused the oats placed before him, till he had knelt down and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, which St. Anthony held in his hands. Legendary narratives of the fourteenth century say this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> took place at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, at Wadding, at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>; the real place, however, was <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a>. <li>The second most important <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> is that of the poisoned food offered him by some <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, which he rendered innoxious by the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>. <li>The third <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> worthy of mention is that of the famous <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermon</a> to the fishes on the bank of the river Brenta in the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>; not <em>at</em> <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, as is generally supposed.</ul>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> with which St. Anthony fought against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and the great and numerous <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversions</a> he made rendered him worthy of the glorious title of <em>Malleus hereticorum</em> (Hammer of the Heretics). Though his preaching was always seasoned with the salt of discretion, nevertheless he spoke openly to all, to the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">rich</a> as to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, to the people as well as those in authority. In a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> at <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a> in the presence of many <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, he reproved the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, Simon de Sully, so severely, that he induced him to sincere amendment.

<p>After having been Guardian at Le-Puy (1224), we find Anthony in the year 1226, Custos Provincial in the province of Limousin. The most authentic <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of that period are the following:

<ul><li>Preaching one night on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of St. Pierre du Queriox at <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>, he remembered he had to sing a Lesson of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>. Interrupting suddenly his discourse, he <a href="../cathen/02568a.htm">appeared at the same moment</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> in choir to sing his Lesson, after which he continued his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermon</a>. <li>Another day preaching in the square <em>des creux des Arenes</em> at <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>, he <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> preserved his audience from the rain. <li>At St. Junien during the <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermon</a>, he predicted that by an artifice of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> would break down, but that all should remain safe and sound. And so it occurred; for while he was preaching, the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> was overthrown, but no one hurt; not even the saint himself. <li>In a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, where he had fallen ill, he delivered by means of his tunic one of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from great <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>. <li>Likewise, by breathing on the face of a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> (whom he had himself received into the order), he confirmed him in his <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">vocation</a>. <li>At Brive, where he had founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, he preserved from the rain the maid-servant of a benefactress who was bringing some vegetables to the brethren for their meagre repast.</ul>

<p>This is all that is historically certain of the sojourn of St. Anthony in Limousin.

<p>Regarding the celebrated <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">apparition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Infant Jesus</a> to our <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, French writers maintain it took place in the province of Limousin at the Castle of Chateauneuf-la-For&ecirc;t, between <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a> and Eymoutiers, whereas the Italian <a href="../cathen/07106b.htm">hagiographers</a> fix the place at Camposanpiero, near <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>. The existing documents, however, do not decide the question. We have more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> regarding the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">apparition</a> of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a> to St. Anthony at the Provincial Chapter of Arles, whilst the latter was preaching about the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the Cross.



<p>After the death of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a>, 3 October, 1226, Anthony returned to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. His way led him through La Provence on which occasion he wrought the following <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>: Fatigued by the journey, he and his companion entered the house of a poor <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who placed bread and wine before them. She had forgotten, however, to shut off the tap of the wine-barrel, and to add to this misfortune, the Saint's companion broke his glass. Anthony began to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and suddenly the glass was made whole, and the barrel filled anew with wine.

<p>Shortly after his return to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Anthony was elected Minister Provincial of Emilia. But in order to devote more time to preaching, he resigned this office at the General Chapter of <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, 30 May, 1230, and retired to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">Convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, which he had himself founded. The last <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> he preached was that of 1231; the crowd of people which came from all parts to hear him, frequently numbered 30,000 and more. His last <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> were principally directed against <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred and enmity</a>, and his efforts were <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with wonderful success. Permanent reconciliations were effected, peace and concord re-established, liberty given to debtors and other <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>, restitutions made, and enormous <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a> repaired; in fact, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a> were no longer sufficient for the number of penitents, and many of these declared they had been warned by <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">celestial visions</a>, and sent to St. Anthony, to be guided by his counsel. Others after his death said that he appeared to them <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">in their slumbers</a>, admonishing them to go to <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confession</a>.

<p>At <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a> also took place the famous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of the amputated foot, which Franciscan writers attribute to St. Anthony. A young man, Leonardo by name, in a fit of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> kicked his own mother. Repentant, he <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessed</a> his fault to St. Anthony who said to him: "The foot of him who kicks his mother deserves to be cut off." Leonardo ran home and cut off his foot. Learning of this, St. Anthony took the amputated member of the unfortunate youth and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> rejoined it.

<p>Through the exertions of St. Anthony, the <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Municipality of Padua</a>, 15 March, 1231, passed a law in favour of debtors who could not pay their <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a>. A copy of this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is still preserved in the museum of <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>. From this, as well as the following occurrence, the civil and religious importance of the Saint's influence in the thirteenth century is easily understood. In 1230, while <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> raged in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, St. Anthony betook himself to <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> to solicit from the ferocious Ezzelino the liberty of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a> <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>. An <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> legend relates that the tyrant humbled himself before the Saint and granted his request. This is not the case, but what does it matter, even if he failed in his attempt; he nevertheless jeopardized his own <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> for the sake of those oppressed by tyranny, and thereby showed his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and sympathy for the people. Invited to preach at the funeral of a <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usurer</a>, he took for his text the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: "Where thy treasure is, there also is thy heart." In the course of the <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermon</a> he said: "That <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">rich</a> man is dead and buried in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>; but go to his treasures and there you will find his heart." The relatives and friends of the deceased, led by curiosity, followed this injunction, and found the heart, still warm, among the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>. Thus the triumph of St. Anthony's missionary career manifests itself not only in his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and his numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, but also in the popularity and subject matter of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a>, since he had to fight against the three most obstinate <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of luxury, <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> and tyranny.

<p>At the end of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, 1231, Anthony retired to Camposanpiero, in the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, where, after a short time he was taken with a severe illness. Transferred to <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>, and strengthened by the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">apparition</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, he died at the age of thirty-six years, on 13 June, 1231. He had lived fifteen years with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, ten years as a Canon Regular of St. Augustine, and eleven years in the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Order of Friars Minor</a>.

<p>Immediately after his death he <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">appeared</a> at <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a> to the Abbot, Thomas Gallo, and his death was also announced to the citizens of <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a> by a troop of children, crying: "The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Father is dead; St. Anthony is dead!" <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, firmly persuaded of his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> by the numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> he had wrought, inscribed him within a year of his death (Pentecost, 30 May, 1232), in the <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">calendar</a> of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> he declared he had personally known the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pontiff</a>, having heard one of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and astonished at his profound <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> called him: "Ark of the Covenant". That this title is well-founded is also shown by his several works: "Expositio in Psalmos", written at <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a>, 1224; the "Sermones de tempore", and the "Sermones de Sanctis", written at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, 1229-30.

<p>The name of Anthony became celebrated throughout the world, and with it the name of <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>. The inhabitants of that city erected to his memory a magnificent temple, whither his precious <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were transferred in 1263, in presence of <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, Minister General at the time. When the vault in which for thirty years his sacred body had reposed was opened, the flesh was found reduced to dust but the tongue uninjured, fresh, and of a lively red colour. <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, beholding this wonder, took the tongue affectionately in his hands and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> it, exclaiming: "O Blessed Tongue that always praised the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and made others <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> Him, now it is evident what great <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> thou hast before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p>The fame of St. Anthony's <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> has never diminished, and even at the present day he is acknowledged as the greatest thaumaturgist of the times. He is especially invoked for the recovery of things lost, as is also expressed in the celebrated <a href="../cathen/12787a.htm">responsory</a> of <a href="../cathen/08558a.htm">Friar Julian of Spires</a>:

<blockquote><p>Si quaeris miracula . . . <br>. . . resque perditas.</p></blockquote>

<p>Indeed his very popularity has to a certain extent obscured his <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>. If we may believe the conclusions of recent critics, some of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">Saint's</a> biographers, in order to meet the ever-increasing demand for the marvellous displayed by his devout clients, and comparatively oblivious of the historical features of his life, have devoted themselves to the task of handing down to posterity the posthumous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> wrought by his <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a>. We need not be surprised, therefore, to find accounts of his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> that may seem to the modern mind trivial or incredible occupying so large a space in the earlier biographies of St. Anthony. It may be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that some of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> attributed to St. Anthony are <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">legendary</a>, but others come to us on such high authority that it is impossible either to eliminate them or explain them away <em>a priori</em> without doing violence to the facts of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history</a>.
