<h1>St. Antonio Maria Zaccaria</h1>  

<p>Founder of the Clerks Regular of St. Paul, commonly known as the <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a>; b. in <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 1502; d. 5 July, 1539. While he was still an infant his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> died, leaving the care of the child's <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> to his mother, who taught him compassion for the poor and suffering by making him her almoner. After completing the studies given in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a> he was sent to Padua for his philosophy, and in 1520, when he had finished this course, began the study of <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at that place. At the age of twenty-two he received his degree of Doctor of Medicine and returned to <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a> to practise his profession. Three years later he began to study <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and received holy orders in 1528. He now devoted himself with renewed energy to <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a> and mercy, visiting and consoling the sick in <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and poor-prisons. The ministry of preaching and the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> produced such great fruit that St. Antonio was encouraged to seek a larger field for his labours and to carry out a great project which he hard formed for the good of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. He went to the populous city of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, of which he was a burgess, and entered the Confraternity of Eternal Wisdom. Among the members of this religious body he allied himself with two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, Fathers Ferrari and Morigia, and told them of his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of founding a congregation of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> at this period was in a deplorable condition. Frequent <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> had devastated the country. The advent of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> soldiery and their contempt for everything <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> had spread the contagion of bad example, while famine and plague followed in the track of the soldiers. These scourges combined to produce a state of misery that appealed most powerfully to Antonio and his associates. <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">"The Congregation of the Regular Clerks of St. Paul"</a>, St. Antonio's work, which began with five members, was canonically sanctioned by <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Pope Clement VII</a> in 1533. Their rule bound them to "regenerate and revive the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Divine worship, and a truly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> way of life by frequent preaching and the faithful administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>."

<p>The first superior of the new congregation was St. Antonio, who soon became known in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> as an apostle. Besides giving conferences in churches to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and lay people, he went into the streets of the city with crucifix in hand, and produced great fruit in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> by preaching on the Passion and Death of Christ and the need of penance for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. In 1536 he resigned the superiorship to Father Morigia and later went to <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a> at the request of Cardinal Ridolfi. There he succeeded in reforming <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> and in bringing two <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to a stricter observance of their rule. In the latter labour he was greatly aided by a congregation of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> "The Angelicals of St. Paul", which he had founded in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. He introduced, also, the devotion of the "Forty Hours' Prayers", in <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>. The last two years of his life were spent in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. He sought there a more suitable church for his Congregation and accepted the offer of the church of S. Barnabas, but died before the affair was arranged. From this <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Barnabas, the Congregation received the name by which its members are commonly known, i.e. <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a>. Worn out by his <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> penances, as well as by his untiring labours of charity, he was attacked by fever during one of his mission. Knowing that this illness was his last, he had himself brought to his native city, <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>. There, in his mother's house, he received the last <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and peacefully expired at the early age of thirty-seven. His body was found incorrupt 27 years after his death. He was declared Blessed by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a> in 1849. (See <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">BARNABITES</a>.) On 15 May, 1897, he was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in St. Peter's, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a>. His writings are: "Detti notabili, raccolti da varii autori" (Venice, 1583); "Constitutiones ordinis clericorum regularium" (not published); "Sermones super praeceptis Decalogi" (not published).
