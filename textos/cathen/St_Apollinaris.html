<h1>St. Apollinaris</h1>  

<p>One of the first great <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of the church. He was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> by St. Peter himself. The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> he wrought there soon attracted official attention, for they and his preaching won many converts to the Faith, while at the same time bringing upon him the fury of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolaters</a>, who beat him cruelly and drove him from the city. He was found half dead on the seashore, and kept in concealment by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, but was captured again and compelled to walk on burning coals and a second time expelled. But he remained in the vicinity, and continued his work of evangelization. We find him then journeying in the province of Aemilia. A third time he returned to <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. Again he was captured, hacked with knives, had scalding water poured over his wounds, was beaten in the mouth with stones because he persisted in preaching, and then, loaded with chains, was flung into a horrible dungeon to starve to death; but after four days he was put on board ship and sent to Greece. There the same course of preachings, and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and sufferings continued; and when his very presence caused the oracles to be silent, he was, after a cruel beating, sent back to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. All this continued for three years, and a fourth time he returned to <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. By this time <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> was Emperor, and he, in answer to the complaints of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, issued a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of banishment against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Apollinaris was kept concealed for some time, but as he was passing out of the gates of the city, was set upon and savagely beaten, probably at Classis, a suburb, but he lived for seven days, foretelling meantime that the persecutions would increase, but that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> would ultimately triumph. It is not certain what was his native place, though it was probably Antioch. Nor is it sure that he was one of the seventy-two disciples of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as has been suggested. The precise date of his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> cannot be ascertained, but he was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> for twenty-six years.
