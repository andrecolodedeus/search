<h1>St. Apollonia</h1>  

<p>A holy virgin who suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in Alexandria during a local uprising against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> previous to the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a> (end of 248, or beginning of 249). During the festivities commemorative of the first millenary of the Roman Empire, the agitation of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> populace rose to a great height, and when one of their poets prophesied a calamity, they committed bloody outrages on the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> whom the authorities made no effort to protect. The great Dionysius, then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> (247-265), relates the sufferings of his people in a letter addressed to Fabius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, long extracts from which <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> has preserved for us (<a href="../fathers/250101.htm"><em>Church History</em> I.6.41</a>). After describing how a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, named respectively Metras and Quinta, were seized by the seditious mob and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> with the most cruel tortures, and how the houses of several other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were completely pillaged, Dionysius continues: "At that time Apollonia the <em>parth&eacute;nos presb&#251;tis (virgo presbytera,</em> by which he very probably means not a virgin advanced in years, but a <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a>) was held in high esteem. These men seized her also and by repeated blows broke all her teeth. They then erected outside the city gates a pile of fagots and threatened to burn her alive if she refused to repeat after them impious words (either a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against Christ, or an invocation of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> gods). Given, at her own request, a little freedom, she sprang quickly into the fire and was burned to death." Apollonia belongs, therefore, to that class of early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who did not await the death they were threatened with, but either to preserve their chastity, or because confronted with the alternative of renouncing their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or suffering death, <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> embraced the latter in the form prepared for them. In the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> paid to her <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> made no distinction between these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and others. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> touches on this question in the first book of the <a href="../fathers/1201.htm">"City of God"</a>, apropos of <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a> (<a href="../fathers/120101.htm"><em>City of God</em> I.26</a>); "But, they say, during the time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> certain <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> plunged into the water with the intention of being swept away by the waves and drowned, and thus preserve their threatened chastity. Although they quitted life in this wise, nevertheless they receive high <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and their feasts are observed with great <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. This is a matter on which I dare not pass judgment lightly. For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not but that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was divinely authorized through trustworthy revelations to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> thus the memory of these <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. It may be that such is the case. May it not be, too, that these acted in such a manner, not through human caprice but on the command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> but through obedience, as we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the case of Samson? When, however, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gives a command and makes it clearly known, who would account obedience thereto a crime or condemn such <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> devotion and ready service?" The narrative of Dionysius does not suggest the slightest reproach as to this act of St. Apollonia; in his eyes she was as much a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> as the others, and as such she was revered in the Alexandrian Church. In time, her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> was also popular in the West. A later legend assigned a similar <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> to Apollonia, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> virgin of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the reign of <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a>. There was, however, but one <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of this name, i.e. the Saint of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> celebrates her memory on 9 February, and she is popularly invoked against the toothache because of the torments she had to endure. She is represented in art with pincers in which a tooth is held. There was a church dedicated to her at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> but it no longer exists. The little square, however, in which it stood is still called "Piazza Sant' Apollonia".
