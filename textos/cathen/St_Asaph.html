<h1>St. Asaph</h1>  

<p>(Or Asa).

<p>First <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> See of that name (second half of the sixth century). No <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> life of him is extant, but local tradition points out the site of his ash tree, his church, his well, and his valley, Onen Asa, Fynnon Asa, Llanasa, Pantasa. All these sites are in Tengenel, near Holiwell indicating probably that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> once had hermitage in that neighbourhood. The want of a <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> life, however, is in part compensated for by Jocelyn of Furness's life of <a href="../cathen/08620a.htm">St. Kentigern</a>, or Mungo, the founder of the <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Diocese of Glasgow</a>. This <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> during his exile (c. 545) betook himself to <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> and there founded the Celtic Monastery of Llanelwy (the church on the Elwy), as the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> still call the town of St. Asaph. Of the building and government of few Celtic <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> do we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> so much as about Llanelwy. The church was built "of smoothed wood, after the fashion of the Britons, seeing that they could not yet build of stone". The 965 disciples, of whom Asa was one, were divided into three groups: 300 of the unlettered farmed the outlying lands, 300 worked in the offices around the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and 365 (the number corresponds to the days of the year) attended to the divine services. Of these the oldest assisted <a href="../cathen/08620a.htm">Kentigern</a> in the government of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and the rest were subdivided into three choirs. "As soon as one choir had terminated its service in church, immediately another entering commenced it: and that again being concluded another entered to celebrate." The founder, after the manner of other Celtie <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, used frequently to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> standing in the icy cold river, and once, having suffered very severely under this hardship, he sent the boy Asa, who was then attending him, to bring a fagot to burn and warm him. Asaph brought him live coals in his apron, and the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> revealed to <a href="../cathen/08620a.htm">Kentigern</a> the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of his disciple. So when the old man was recalled to Strathclyde, after the battle of Ardderyd, in 573 (the only definite date we have in the life), Asaph was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to succeed him, and became the first <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. The feast of his deposition is kept on 1 May, but we possess no further details of his life, nor do we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the year of his death.
