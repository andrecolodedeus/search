<h1>St. Attracta</h1>  

<p>(Or ST. ARAGHT).

<p>A contemporary of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> from whom she received the veil. She is known as the foundress of several churches in the Counties of <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a> and Sligo, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. <a href="../cathen/04099c.htm">Colgan's</a> account of her life is based on that written by Augustine Magraidin in the last years of fourteenth century, and abounds in improbable statements. However, the fact of St. Attracta receiving the veil from <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> is corroborated by Tirech&aacute;n, in the "Book of Armagh", as is evident from the following passage in the "Documenta de S. Patricio" (ed. Edmund Hogan, S.J.): "Et ecclesiam posuit in cella Adrachtae, filiae Talain, et ipsa accepit pallium de manu Patricii." A native of the County Sligo, she resolved to devote herself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but being opposed by her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, fled to South Connacht and made her first foundation at Drumconnell, near Boyle, County Roscommon, whence she removed to Greagraighe or Coolavin, County Sligo. At Killaraght, St. Attracta established a hospice for travellers, which existed as late as 1539. Her name was so great that numerous places were named after her, e.g. Killaraght (Cill Attracta), Toberaraght, Cloghan Araght, etc., and a large village which grew up around her oratory at Killaraght in Coolavin. <a href="../cathen/04099c.htm">Colgan</a> gives an account of the Cross of St. Attracta which was famed during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and of which the O'Mochain <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> were hereditary keepers. A striking confirmation of the existence of this <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> in the early years of the fifteenth century is afforded by an entry in the "Calendar of Papal Letters" (VI, 451) from which we learn that in 1413 the cross and cup of St. Attracta (Crux ac Cuach Aracht) were then <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the church of Killaraght, in the <a href="../cathen/01102f.htm">Diocese of Achonry</a>. By an Indult of 28 July, 1864, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> authorized the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a> and <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> of St. Attracta, which had lapsed into desuetude, to be again celebrated in the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church. The feast of St. Attracta, on 11 August, is given special <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01102f.htm">Diocese of Achonry</a>, of which she is the patroness. The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and proper lessons for her Office were drawn up by <a href="../cathen/14366a.htm">Cardinal Moran</a>.
