<h1>St. Avitus</h1>  

<p>(Alcimus Ecdicius).

<p>A distinguished <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Vienne, in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, from 490 to about 518, though his death is place by some as late as 525 or 526. He was born of a prominent Gallo-Roman <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> closely related to the Emperor Avitus and other illustrious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and in which episcopal honors were hereditary. In difficult times for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and Roman culture in Southern Gaul, Avitus exercised a favourable influence. He pursued with earnestness and success the extinction of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian heresy</a> in the barbarian Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> (443-532), won the confidence of King Gundobad, and converted his son, King Sigismund (516-523). He was also a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> opponent of Semipelagianism, and of the <a href="../cathen/01082a.htm">Acacian</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">Schism</a> at Constantinople. Like his contemporary, Ennodius of Pavia, he was strenuous in his assertion of the authority of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> as the chief bulwark of religious unity and the incipient <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> civilization. "If the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>," he says, "is rejected, it follows that not one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the whole episcopate threatens to fall" (<em>Si papa urbis vocatur in dubium, episcopatus videbitur, non episcopus, vaccilare</em>. &#151; Ep. xxxiv; ed. Peiper). The literary fame of Avitus rests on a poem of 2,552 hexameters, in five books, dealing with the Scriptural narrative of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">Original Sin</a>, Expulsion from <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Paradise</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">Deluge</a>, the Crossing of the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>. The first three books offer a certain dramatic unity; in them are told the preliminaries of the great disaster, the catastrophe itself, and the consequences. The fourth and fifth books deal with the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">Deluge</a> and the Crossing of the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> as symbols of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Avitus deals freely and familiarly with the Scriptural events, and exhibits well their beauty, sequence, and significance. He is one of the last masters of the art of rhetoric as taught in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Gaul in the fourth and fifth centuries. Ebert says that none of the ancient <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> poets treated more successfully the poetic elements of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. His poetic diction, though abounding in archaisms and rhythmic redundancy, is pure and select, and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of metre are well observed. It is said that Milton made use of his paraphrase [sic] of Scripture in the preparation of "Paradise Lost". He wrote also 666 hexameters "De virginitate" or "De consolatori&acirc; castitatis laude" for the comfort of his sister Fuscina, a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>. His prose works include "Contra Eutychianam H&aelig;resim libri II", written in 512 or 513, and also about eighty-seven letters that are of considerable importance for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and political history of the years 499-518. Among them is the famous letter to <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a> on the occasion of his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. There was once extant a collection of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>, but they have perished with the exception of two and some fragments and excerpts. In recent times Julien Havet has demonstrated (Questions m&eacute;rovingiennes, Paris, 1885), that Avitus is not the author of the "Dialogi cum Gundobado Rege", a defence of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, purporting to represent the famous Colloquy of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> in 449, and first published by d'Ach&eacute;ry (1661) in his "Spicilegium" (V, 110-116). It is a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> of the Oratorian, J&eacute;rome Viguier, who also forged the letter of Pope Symmachus (13 Oct., 501) to Avitus. The works of Avitus are found in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., LIX, 191-398. There are two recent editions: one by R. Peiper (in Mon. Germ. Hist.: Auct. Antiq., VI, Berlin, 1883), the other by U. Chevalier (Lyons, 1890).
