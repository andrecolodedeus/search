<h1>St. Baithen of Iona</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, specially selected by <a href="../cathen/04136a.htm">St. Columba</a> as one of the band of missionaries who set sail for <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">Britain</a> in 563. Born in 536, the son of Brenaron, he was an ardent disciple of St. Columba, and was appointed <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Tiree Island, a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> founded by <a href="../cathen/04152c.htm">St. Comgall</a> of Bangor. <a href="../cathen/01135c.htm">St. Adamnan</a>, in recording the death of St. Columba, tells us that the dying words of the Apostle of <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a>, as he was transcribing the <a href="../bible/psa053.htm">fifty-third Psalm</a>, were: "I must stop here, let Baithen write what follows". Baithen had been looked on as the most likely successor of St. Columba, and so it happened that on the death of that great apostle, in 596, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> unanimously confirmed the choice of their founder. St. Baithen was in high esteem as a wise counsellor, and his advice was sought by many <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, including St. Fintan Munnu of Taghmon.

<p><a href="../cathen/01135c.htm">St. Adamnan (Eunan)</a>, the biographer of St. Columba, tells many interesting incidents in the life of St. Baithen, but the mere fact of being the immediate successor of St. Columba, by the express wish of that apostle, is almost sufficient to attest his worth. The "Martyrology of Donegal" records the two following anecdotes. When St. Baithen partook of food, before each morsel in invariably recited "Deus in adjutorium meum intende". Also, "when he worked in the fields, gathering in the corn along with the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, he used to hold up one hand towards <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, beseeching <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while with the other hand he gathered the corn". St. Baithen of <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a> is generally known as Baithen Mor, to distinguish him from eight other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the same name &#151; the affix <em>mor</em> meaning "the Great". He wrote a life of his master, and some <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> poems, which are now lost, but which were seen by <a href="../cathen/01135c.htm">St. Adamnan</a>. He only ruled <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a> three years, as his death took place in the year 600, though the "Annals of Ulster" give the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> as 598. Perhaps the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> year may be 599. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on October 6th. Some writers assert that St. Baithen of <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a> is the <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron</a> of Ennisboyne, County Wicklow, but this is owing to a confusion with St. Baoithin, or Baithin mac Findech, whose <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is commemorated on 22 May. Another St. Baoithin, son of Cuana, whose <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is on 19 February, is patron of Tibohin, in Elphin.
