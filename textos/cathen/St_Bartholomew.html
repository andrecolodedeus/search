<div id="springfield2">
<h1>St. Bartholomew</h1>  

<p>One of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve Apostles</a>, mentioned sixth in the three <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> lists (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs3">Matthew 10:3</a>; <a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs18">Mark 3:18</a>; <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#vrs14">Luke 6:14</a>), and seventh in the list of <a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs13">Acts (1:13)</a>.

<p>The name (<em>Bartholomaios</em>) means "son of Talmai" (or Tholmai) which was an ancient <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">Hebrew name</a>, borne, e.g. by the King of Gessur whose daughter was a wife of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> (<a href="../bible/2sa003.htm#vrs3">2 Samuel 3:3</a>). It shows, at least, that Bartholomew was of Hebrew descent; it may have been his genuine proper name or simply added to distinguish him as the son of Talmai. Outside the instances referred to, no other mention of the name occurs in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>.

<p>Nothing further is known of him for <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>. Many scholars, however, identify him with <a href="../cathen/10711b.htm">Nathaniel</a> (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs45">John 1:45-51</a>; <a href="../bible/joh021.htm#vrs2">21:2</a>). The reasons for this are that Bartholomew is not the proper name of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a>; that the name never occurs in the <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">Fourth Gospel</a>, while <a href="../cathen/10711b.htm">Nathaniel</a> is not mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">synoptics</a>; that Bartholomew's name is coupled with <a href="../cathen/11799a.htm">Philip's</a> in the lists of <a href="../bible/mat000.htm">Matthew</a> and <a href="../bible/luk000.htm">Luke</a>, and found next to it in <a href="../bible/mar000.htm">Mark</a>, which agrees well with the fact shown by <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">St. John</a> that <a href="../cathen/11799a.htm">Philip</a> was an old friend of <a href="../cathen/10711b.htm">Nathaniel's</a> and brought him to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>; that the call of <a href="../cathen/10711b.htm">Nathaniel</a>, mentioned with the call of several <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, seems to mark him for the apostolate, especially since the rather full and beautiful narrative leads one to expect some important development; that <a href="../cathen/10711b.htm">Nathaniel</a> was of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> where <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> found most, if not all, of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve</a>; finally, that on the occasion of the appearance of the risen <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Savior</a> on the shore of the <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">Sea of Tiberias</a>, <a href="../cathen/10711b.htm">Nathaniel</a> is found present, together with several <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> who are named and two unnamed <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">Disciples</a> who were, almost certainly, likewise <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> (the word "apostle" not occurring in the <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">Fourth Gospel</a> and <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">"disciple"</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> ordinarily meaning <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a>) and so, presumably, was one of the Twelve. This chain of circumstantial evidence is ingenious and pretty strong; the weak link is that, after all, <a href="../cathen/10711b.htm">Nathaniel</a> may have been another personage in whom, for some reason, the author of the <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">Fourth Gospel</a> may have been particularly interested, as he was in <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, who is likewise not named in the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">synoptics</a>.

<p>No mention of St. Bartholomew occurs in ecclesiastical literature before <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, who mentions that <a href="../cathen/11446b.htm">Pantaenus</a>, the master of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, while evangelizing <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, was told that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> had preached there before him and had given to his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a> the <a href="../cathen/10057a.htm">Gospel of St. Matthew</a> written in Hebrew, which was still treasured by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. "India" was a name covering a very wide area, including even Arabia Felix. Other traditions represent St. Bartholomew as preaching in Mesopotamia, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, Lycaonia, Phrygia, and on the shores of the Black Sea; one legend, it is interesting to note, identifies him with <a href="../cathen/10711b.htm">Nathaniel</a>.

<p>The manner of his death, said to have occurred at Albanopolis in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, is equally uncertain; according to some, he was beheaded, according to others, flayed alive and crucified, head downward, by order of Astyages, for having <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> his brother, Polymius, King of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. On account of this latter legend, he is often represented in <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a> (e.g. in <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo's</a> Last Judgment) as flayed and holding in his hand his own skin. His <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are thought by some to be preserved in the church of St. Bartholomew-in-the-Island, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 24 August. An <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> of Bartholomew existed in the early ages.
