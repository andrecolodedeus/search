<h1>St. Benedict of Nursia</h1>  

<p>Founder of <a href="../cathen/10472a.htm">western monasticism</a>, born at Nursia, c. 480; died at <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, 543. The only authentic life of Benedict of Nursia is that contained in the second book of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory's</a> "Dialogues". It is rather a character sketch than a biography and consists, for the most part, of a number of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> incidents, which, although they illustrate the life of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, give little help towards a chronological account of his career. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory's</a> authorities for all that he relates were the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> own disciples, viz. Constantinus, who succeeded him as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>; and Honoratus, who was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a> when <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> wrote his "Dialogues".

<p>Benedict was the son of a Roman noble of Nursia, a small town near <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, and a tradition, which <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede</a> accepts, makes him a twin with his sister Scholastica. His boyhood was spent in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he lived with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and attended the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> until he had reached his higher studies. Then "giving over his books, and forsaking his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> house and wealth, with a mind only to serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he sought for some place where he might attain to the desire of his holy purpose; and in this sort he departed [from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>], instructed with learned <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and furnished with unlearned wisdom" (Dial. St. Greg., II, Introd. in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L. LXVI). There is much difference of opinion as to Benedict's age at the time. It has been very generally stated as fourteen, but a careful examination of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory's</a> narrative makes it impossible to suppose him younger than nineteen or twenty. He was old enough to be in the midst of his literary studies, to understand the real meaning and worth of the dissolute and licentious lives of his companions, and to have been deeply affected himself by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> (Ibid. II, 2). He was capable of weighing all these things in comparison with the life taught in the Gospels, and chose the latter, He was at the beginning of life, and he had at his disposal the means to a career as a Roman noble; clearly he was not a child, As <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> expresses it, "he was in the world and was free to enjoy the advantages which the world offers, but drew back his foot which he had, as it were, already set forth in the world" (ibid., Introd.). If we accept the date 480 for his birth, we may fix the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his abandoning the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and quitting home at about A.D. 500.

<p>Benedict does not seem to have left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the purpose of becoming a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>, but only to find some place away from the life of the great city; moreover, he took his old nurse with him as a servant and they settled down to live in Enfide, near a church dedicated to St. Peter, in some kind of association with "a company of virtuous men" who were in sympathy with his feelings and his views of life. Enfide, which the tradition of <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a> identifies with the modern Affile, is in the Simbrucini mountains, about forty miles from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and two from <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a>. It stands on the crest of a ridge which rises rapidly from the valley to the higher range of mountains, and seen from the lower ground the village has the appearance of a fortress. As <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory's</a> account indicates, and as is confirmed by the remains of the old town and by the inscriptions found in the neighbourhood, Enfide was a place of greater importance than is the present town. At Enfide Benedict worked his first <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> by restoring to perfect condition an earthenware wheat-sifter (<em>capisterium</em>) which his old servant had accidentally broken. The <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notoriety</a> which this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> brought upon Benedict drove him to escape still farther from social life, and "he fled secretly from his nurse and sought the more retired district of <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a>". His purpose of life had also been modified. He had fled <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to escape the evils of a great city; he now determined to be poor and to live by his own work. "For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake he deliberately chose the hardships of life and the weariness of labour" (ibid., 1).

<p>A short distance from Enfide is the entrance to a narrow, gloomy valley, penetrating the mountains and leading directly to <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a>. Crossing the Anio and turning to the right, the path rises along the left face oft the ravine and soon reaches the site of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero's</a> villa and of the huge mole which formed the lower end of the middle lake; across the valley were ruins of the Roman baths, of which a few great arches and detached masses of wall still stand. Rising from the mole upon twenty five low arches, the foundations of which can even yet be traced, was the bridge from the villa to the baths, under which the waters of the middle lake poured in a wide fall into the lake below. The ruins of these vast buildings and the wide sheet of falling water closed up the entrance of the valley to St. Benedict as he came from Enfide; today the narrow valley lies open before us, closed only by the far off mountains. The path continues to ascend, and the side of the ravine, on which it runs, becomes steeper, until we reach a cave above which the mountain now rises almost perpendicularly; while on the right hand it strikes in a rapid descent down to where, in St. Benedict's day, five hundred feet below, lay the blue waters of the lake. The cave has a large triangular-shaped opening and is about ten feet deep. On his way from Enfide, Benedict met a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, Romanus, whose <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was on the mountain above the cliff overhanging the cave. Romanus had discussed with Benedict the purpose which had brought him to <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a>, and had given him the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk's</a> habit. By his advice Benedict became a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> and for three years, unknown to men, lived in this cave above the lake. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> tells us little of these years, He now speaks of Benedict no longer as a youth (<em>puer</em>), but as a man (<em>vir</em>) of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Romanus, he twice tells us, served the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> in every way he could. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> apparently visited him frequently, and on fixed days brought him food.



<p>During these three years of solitude, broken only by occasional communications with the outer world and by the visits of Romanus, he matured both in mind and character, in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of himself and of his fellow-man, and at the same time he became not merely known to, but secured the respect of, those about him; so much so that on the death of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the neighbourhood (identified by some with Vicovaro), the community came to him and begged him to become its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. Benedict was acquainted with the life and discipline of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that "their manners were diverse from his and therefore that they would never agree together: yet, at length, overcome with their entreaty, he gave his consent" (ibid., 3). The experiment failed; the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> tried to poison him, and he returned to his cave. From this time his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> seen to have become frequent, and many people, attracted by his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and character, came to <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a> to be under his guidance. For them he built in the valley twelve <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, in each of which he placed a superior with twelve <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. In a thirteenth he lived with "a few, such as he thought would more profit and be better instructed by his own presence" (ibid., 3). He remained, however, the father or <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of all. With the establishment of these <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> began the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for children; and amongst the first to be brought were Maurus and Placid.

<p>The remainder of St. Benedict's life was spent in realizing the ideal of monasticism which he has left us drawn out in his Rule, and before we follow the slight chronological story given by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, it will be better to examine the ideal, which, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> says, is St. Benedict's real biography (ibid., 36). We will deal here with the Rule only so far as it is an element in St. Benedict's life. For the relations which it bore to the monasticism of previous centuries, and for its influence throughout the West on civil and religious government, and upon the spiritual life of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, the reader is referred to the articles <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">MONASTICISM</a> and RULE OF SAINT BENEDICT.
<h2>The Benedictine rule</h2>

<p>1. Before studying <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">St. Benedict's Rule</a> it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to point out that it is written for <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, not for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. The saint's purpose was not to institute an order of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> with <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and offices, but an organization and a set of rules for the domestic life of such <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> as wished to live as fully as possible the type of life presented in the Gospel. "My words", he says, "are addressed to thee, whoever thou art, that, renouncing thine own will, dost put on the strong and bright armour of obedience in order to fight for the Lord Christ, our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> King." (Prol. to Rule.) Later, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> imposed the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> state upon <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, and with the state came a preponderance of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, but the impress of the lay origin of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> has remained, and is perhaps the source of some of the characteristics which mark them off from later orders.

<p>2. Another characteristic feature of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> Rule is its view of work. His so-called order was not established to carry on any particular work or to meet any special special crisis in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as has been the case with other orders. With Benedict the work of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> was only a means to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of life. The great disciplinary force for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is work; idleness is its ruin. The purpose of his Rule was to bring men "back to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the labour of obedience, from whom they had departed by the idleness of disobedience". Work was the first condition of all growth in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. It was in order that his own life might be "wearied with labours for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake" that St. Benedict left Enfide for the cave at <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, comments <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> elect should at the beginning, when life and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> are strong are strong in them, "be wearied with labour and pains". In the regeneration of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the order of discipline, even <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> comes after work, for grace meets with no co-operation in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and heart of an idler. When the Goth "gave over the world" and went to <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a>, St. Benedict gave him a bill-hook and set him to clear away briars for the making of a garden. <em>"Ecce! labora!"</em> go and work. Work is not, as the civilization of the time taught, the condition peculiar to slaves; it is the universal lot of man, <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for his well-being as a man, and essential for him as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.

<p>3. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, as conceived by St. Benedict is essentially social. Life apart from one's fellows, the life of a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>, if it is to be wholesome and sane, is possible only for a few, and these few must have reached an advanced stage of self-discipline while living with others (Rule, 1). The Rule, therefore, is entirely occupied with regulating the life of a community of men who live and work and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and eat together, and this is not merely for a course of training, but as a permanent element of life at its best. The Rule conceives the superiors as always present and in constant touch with every member of the government, which is best described as patriarchal, or paternal (ibid., 2, 3, 64). The superior is the head of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; all are the permanent members of a household. Hence, too, much of the spiritual teaching of the Rule is concealed under legislation which seems purely social and domestic organization (ibid. 22-23, 35-41). So intimately connected with domestic life is the whole framework and teaching of the Rule that a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> may be more truly said to enter or join a particular household than to join an order. The social character of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> life has found expression in a fixed type for <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and in the kind of works which <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> undertake, and it is secured by an absolute communism in possessions (ibid. 33, 34, 54, 55), by the rigorous suppression of all differences of worldly rank - "no one of noble birth may [for that reason] be put before him that was formerly a slave" (ibid. 2). and by the enforced presence of everyone at the routine <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the household.

<p>4. Although private ownership is most strictly forbidden by the Rule, it was no part of St. Benedict's conception of monastic life that his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, as a body, should strip themselves of all wealth and live upon the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of the charitable; rather his purpose was to restrict the requirements of the individual to what was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and simple, and to secure that the use and administration of the corporate possessions should be in strict accord with the teaching of the Gospel. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> ideal of poverty is quite different from the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> takes no explicit <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty; he only <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> obedience according to the Rule. The rule allows all that is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to each individual, together with sufficient and varied clothing, abundant food (excluding only the flesh of quadrupeds), wine and ample sleep (ibid., 39, 40, 41, 55). Possessions could be held in common, they might be large, but they were to be administered for the furtherance of the work of the community and for the benefit of others. While the individual <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> was poor, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was to be in a position to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, not to be compelled to seek them. It was to relieve the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, to clothe the naked, to visit the sick, to bury the dead, to help the afflicted (ibid., 4), to entertain all strangers (ibid., 3). The poor came to Benedict to get help to pay their <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a> (Dial. St. Greg., 27); they came for food (ibid., 21, 28).

<p>5. St. Benedict originated a form of government which is deserving of study. It is contained in chapters 2, 3, 31, 64, 65 of the Rule and in certain pregnant phrases scattered through other chapters. As with the Rule itself, so also his scheme of government is intended not for an order but for a single community. He presupposes that the community have bound themselves, by their promise of stability, to spend their lives together under the Rule. The superior is then elected by a free and universal suffrage. The government may be described as a monarchy, with the Rule as its constitution. Within the four corners of the Rule everything is left to the discretion of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, the abuse of whose authority is checked by religion (Rule, 2), by open debate with the community on all important matters, and with its representative elders in smaller concerns (ibid., 3). The reality of these checks upon the wilfulness of the ruler can be appreciated only when it is remembered that ruler and community were bound together for life, that all were inspired by the single purpose of carrying out the conception of life taught in the Gospel, and that the relation of the members of the community to one another and to the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> to them, were elevated and spiritualized by a <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> which set before itself the acceptance of the teachings of the Sermon on the Mount as real and work-a-day <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>.

<p>6. (a) When a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> household, a community, has been organized by the willing acceptance of its social <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and responsibilities, by obedience to an authority, and, further, is under the continuous discipline of work and self-denial, the next step in the regeneration of its members in their return to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. The Rule deals directly and explicitly only with public <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. For this Benedict assigns the Psalms and Canticles, with readings from the Scriptures and Fathers. He devotes eleven chapters out of the seventy-three of his Rule to regulating this public <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and it is characteristic of the freedom of his Rule and of the "moderation" of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, that he concludes his very careful directions by saying that if any superior does not like his arrangement he is free to make another; this only he says he will insist on, that the whole <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> will be said in the course of a week. The practice of the holy Fathers, he adds, was resolutely "to say in a single day what I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> we tepid <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> may get through in a whole week" (ibid., 18). On the other hand, he checks indiscreet <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> by laying down the general rule "that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> made in common must always be short" (ibid., 20). It is very difficult to reduce St. Benedict's teaching on <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to a system, for this reason, that in his conception of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> character, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is coexistent with the whole life, and life is not complete at any point unless penetrated by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. .

<p>(b) The form of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which thus covers the whole of our waking hours, St. Benedict calls the first degree of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. It consists in realizing the <a href="../cathen/12396a.htm">presence of God</a> (ibid., 7). The first step begins when the spiritual is joined to the merely human, or, as the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> expresses it, it is the first step in a ladder, the rungs of which rest at one end in the body and at the other in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The ability to exercise this form of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is fostered by that care of the "heart" on which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> so often insists; and the heart is saved from the dissipation that would result from social intercourse by the habit of mind which sees in everyone <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself. "Let the sick be served in very deed as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself" (ibid., 36). "Let all guests that come be received as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>" (ibid., 53). "Whether we be slaves or freemen, we are all one in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and bear an equal rank in the service of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>" (ibid., 2).

<p>(c) Secondly, there is public <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. This is short and is to be said at intervals, at night and at seven distinct hours during the day, so that, when possible, there shall be no great interval without a call to formal, vocal, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> (ibid., 16). The position which St. Benedict gave to public, common <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> can best be described by saying that he established it as the centre of the common life to which he bound his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. It was the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, not only of the individual, but of the whole community to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the oft-repeated daily public acts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. and of praise and adoration of the Creator; and this public worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <em>opus Dei</em>, was to form the chief work of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and to be the source from which all other works took their inspiration, their direction, and their strength.

<p>(d) Lastly, there is private <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, for which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> does not legislate. It follows individual gifts - "If anyone wishes to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in private, let him go quietly into the oratory and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, not with a loud voice, but with tears and fervour of heart" (ibid., 52). "Our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> ought to be short and with purity of heart, except it be perchance prolonged by the inspiration of divine grace" (ibid., 20). But if St. Benedict gives no further directions on private <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, it is because the whole condition and mode of life secured by the Rule, and the character formed by its observance, lead naturally to the higher states of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. As the Saint writes: "Whoever, therefore, thou art that hastenest to thy heavenly country, fulfil by the help of Christ this little Rule which we have written for beginners; and then at length thou shalt arrive, under <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> protection, at the lofty summits of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and virtue of which we have spoken above" (ibid., 73). for guidance in these higher states the Saint refers to the Fathers, Basil and Cassian.

<p>From this short examination of the Rule and its system of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, it will be obvious that to describe the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> as a contemplative order is misleading, if the word is used in its modern technical sense as excluding active work; the "contemplative" is a form of life framed for different circumstances and with a different object from St. Benedict's. The Rule, including its system of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and public psalmody, is meant for every class of mind and every degree of learning. It is framed not only for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> and for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> advanced in perfection, but it organizes and directs a complete life which is adapted for simple folk and for sinners, for the observance of the Commandments and for the beginnings of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. "We have written this Rule", writes St. Benedict, "that by observing it in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, we may shew ourselves to have some degree of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in life and a beginning of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. But for him who would hasten to the perfection of religion, there are the teachings of the holy Fathers, the following whereof bringeth a man to the height of perfection" (ibid., 73). Before leaving the subject of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> it will be well to point out again that by ordering the public recitation and singing of the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a>, St. Benedict was not putting upon his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> a distinctly <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> was the common form of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; we must not read into his Rule characteristics which a later age and discipline have made inseparable from the public recitation of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>.

<p>We can now take up again the story of Benedict's life. How long he remained at <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a> we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. <a href="../cathen/14788c.htm">Abbot Tosti</a> conjectures it was until the year 529. Of these years <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> is content to tell no more than a few stories descriptive of the life of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and of the character and government of St. Benedict. The latter was making his first attempt to realize in these twelve <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> his conception of the monastic life. We can fill in many of the details from the Rule. By his own experiment and his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the history of monasticism the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> had learnt that the regeneration of the individual, except in abnormal cases, is not reached by the path of solitude, nor by that of austerity, but by the beaten path of man's social <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>, with its <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> conditions of obedience and work; and that neither the body nor the mind can be safely overstrained in the effort to avoid <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> (ibid., 64). Thus, at <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a> we find no solitaries, no conventual <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a>, no great austerities, but men living together in organized communities for the purpose of leading good lives, doing such work as came to their hand - carrying water up the steep mountain-side, doing the other household work, raising the twelve <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a>, clearing the ground, making gardens, teaching children, preaching to the country people, reading and studying at least four hours a day, receiving strangers, accepting and training new-comers, attending the regular hours of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, reciting and chanting the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a>. The life at <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a> and the character of St. Benedict attracted many to the new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and their increasing numbers and growing influence came the inevitable jealousy and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, which culminated with a vile attempt of a neighboring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalize</a> the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> by an exhibition of naked <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, dancing in the courtyard of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (Dial. St. Greg., 8). To save his followers from further <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> Benedict left <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a> and went to <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>.

<p>Upon the crest of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> "there was an ancient <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in which the foolish and simple country people, according to the custom of the old <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, worshipped the god Apollo. Round about it likewise upon all sides there were woods for the service of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>, in which, even to that very time, the mad multitude of infidels did offer most wicked sacrifice. The man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, coming hither, feat in pieces the idol, overthrew the altar, set fire on the woods and in the temple of Apollo built the oratory of St. Martin: and where the altar of the same Apollo was, he made an oratory of St. John: and by his continual preaching he brought the people dwelling in those parts to embrace the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>" (ibid., 8). On this spot the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> built his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. His experience at <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a> had led him to alter his plans, and now, instead of building several houses with a small community in each, he kept all his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in one <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and provided for its government by appointing a prior and deans (Rule, 65, 21). We find no trace in his Rule, which was most probably written at <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, of the view which guided him when he built the twelve small <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a>. The life which we have witnessed at <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a> was renewed at <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a> was renewed at <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, but the change in the situation and local conditions brought a corresponding modification in the work undertaken by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a> was a retired valley away in the mountains and difficult of access; Cassino was on one of the great highways to the south of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and at no great distance from <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>. This brought the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> into more frequent communication with the outside world. It soon became a centre of influence in a district in which there was a large population, with several <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Abbots came to see and advise with Benedict. Men of all classes were frequent visitors, and he numbered nobles and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> among his intimate friends. There were <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> in the neighbourhood whom the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> went to preach to and to teach. There was a village nearby in which St. Benedict preached and made many converts (Dial. St. Greg., 19). The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> became the protector of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, their trustee (ibid., 31), their refuge in sickness, in trial, in accidents, in want.

<p>Thus during the life of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> we find what has ever since remained a characteristic feature of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> houses, i.e. the members take up any work which is adapted to their peculiar circumstances, any work which may be dictated by their necessities. Thus we find the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> teaching in poor <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, practising the arts and following agriculture, undertaking the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, or devoting themselves wholly to study. No work is foreign to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, provided only it is compatible with living in community and with the performance of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>. This freedom in the choice of work was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in a Rule which was to be suited to all times and places, but it was primarily the natural result of the which St. Benedict had in view, and which he differs from the founders of later orders. These later had in view some special work to which they wished their disciples to devote themselves; St. Benedict's purpose was only to provide a Rule by which anyone might follow the Gospel counsels, and live, and work and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and save his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory's</a> narrative of the establishment of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> does little more for us than to supply disconnected incidents which illustrate the daily life of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. We gain only a few biographical facts. From <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> St. Benedict founded another <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> near <a href="../cathen/14518c.htm">Terracina</a>, on the coast, about forty miles distant (ibid., 22). To the wisdom of long experience and to the mature virtues of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, was now added the gift of prophecy, of which <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> gives many examples. Celebrated among these is the story of the visit of Totila, King of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>, in the year 543, when the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> "rebuked him for his wicked deeds, and in a few words told him all that should befall him, saying 'Much wickedness do you daily commit, and many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have you done: now at length give over your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> life. Into the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> shall you enter, and over the sea shall you pass: nine years shall you reign, and in the tenth shall you leave this mortal life.' The king, hearing these things, was wonderfully afraid, and desiring the holy man to commend him to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> he departed: and from that time forward he was nothing so cruel as before he had been. Not long after he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, sailed over into <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and in the tenth year of his reign he lost his kingdom together with his life." (ibid., 15).

<p>Totila's visit to <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> in 543 is the only certain date we have in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> life. It must have occurred when Benedict was advanced in age. <a href="../cathen/14788c.htm">Abbot Tosti</a>, following others, puts the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> death in the same year. Just before his death we hear for the first time of his sister Scholastica. "She had been dedicated from her infancy to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, and used to come once a year to visit her brother. To whom the man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> went not far from the gate to a place that did belong to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, there to give her entertainment" (ibid., 33). They met for the last time three days before Scholastica's death, on a day "when the sky was so clear that no cloud was to be seen". The sister begged her brother to stay the night, "but by no persuasion would he agree unto that, saying that he might not by any means tarry all night out of his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>.... The <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> receiving this denial of her brother, joining her hands together, laid them on the table; and so bowing her head upon them, she made her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>, and lifting her head from the table, there fell suddenly such a tempest of lightening and thundering, and such abundance of rain, that neither venerable Bennet, nor the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> that were with him, could put their head out of door" (ibid., 33). Three days later, "Benedict beheld the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of his sister, which was departed from her body, in the likeness of a dove, to ascend into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: who rejoicing much to see her great glory, with <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and lauds gave thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>, and did impart news of this her death to his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> whom also he sent presently to bring her corpse to his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, to have it buried in that grave which he had provided for himself" (ibid., 34).

<p>It would seem to have been about this time that St. Benedict had that wonderful vision in which he came as near to seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as is possible for man in this life. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> and <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a> say that Benedict saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and in that vision of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saw the whole world. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> will not allow that this could have been. <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, however, does not hesitate to say that "the saint merited while still in this mortal life, to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself and in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> all that is below him". If he did not see the Creator, he saw the light which is in the Creator, and in that light, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> says, "saw the whole world gathered together as it were under on beam of the sun. At the same time he saw the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Germanus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, in a fiery globe carried up by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>" (ibid., 35). Once more the hidden things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were shown to him, and he warned his brethren, both "those that lived daily with him and those that dwelt far off" of his approaching death. "Six days before he left this world he gave orders to have his sepulchre opened, and forthwith falling into an ague, he began with burning heat to wax faint; and when as the sickness daily increased, upon the sixth day he commanded his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to carry him into the oratory, where he did arm himself receiving the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Body and Blood of our Saviour Christ</a>; and having his weak body holden up betwixt the hands of his disciples, he stood with his own hands lifted up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; and as he was in that manner <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, he gave up the ghost" (ibid., 37). He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the same grave with his sister "in the oratory of St. John the Baptist, which [he] himself had built when he overthrew the altar of Apollo" (ibid.). There is some <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> are still at <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, or whether they were moved in the seventh century to Fleury. <a href="../cathen/14788c.htm">Abbot Tosti</a> in his life of St. Benedict, discusses the question at length (chap. xi) and decides the controversy in favour of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>.

<p>Perhaps the most striking characteristics in St. Benedict are his deep and wide human feeling and his moderation. The former reveals itself in the many anecdotes recorded by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>. We see it in his sympathy and care for the simplest of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; his hastening to the help of the poor Goth who had lot his bill-hook; spending the hours of the night in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> on the mountain to save his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> the labour of carrying water, and to remove from their lives a "just cause of grumbling"; staying three days in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to help to induce one of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to "remain quietly at his prayers as the other monks did", instead of going forth from the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and wandering about "busying himself worldly and transitory things". He lets the crow from the neighboring woods come daily when all are at dinner to be fed by himself. His mind is always with those who are absent; sitting in his cell he knows that Placid is fallen into the lake; he foresees the accident to the builders and sends a warning to them; in spirit and some kind of real presence he is with the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> "eating and refreshing themselves" on their journey, with his friend Valentinian on his way to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> taking a present from the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, with the new community in <a href="../cathen/14518c.htm">Terracina</a>. Throughout <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory's</a> narrative he is always the same quiet, gentle, dignified, strong, peace-loving man who by the subtle power of sympathy becomes the centre of the lives and interests of all about him. We see him with his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in the church, at their reading, sometimes in the fields, but more commonly in his cell, where frequent messengers find him "weeping silently in his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>", and in the night hours standing at "the window of his cell in the tower, offering up his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"; and often, as Totila found him, sitting outside the door of his cell, or "before the gate of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> reading a book". He has given his own portrait in his ideal picture of an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> (Rule, 64): <blockquote> It beseemeth the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> to be ever doing some good for his brethren rather than to be presiding over them. He must, therefore, be learned in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that he may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whence to bring forth things new and old; he must be chaste, sober, and merciful, ever preferring mercy to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, that he himself may obtain mercy. Let him hate <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the brethren. And even in his corrections, let him act with <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and not go too far, lest while he seeketh too eagerly to scrape off the rust, the vessel be broken. Let him keep his own frailty ever before his eyes, and remember that the bruised reed must not be broken. And by this we do not mean that he should suffer vices to grow up; but that prudently and with charity he should cut them off, in the way he shall see best for each, as we have already said; and let him study rather to be <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> than feared. Let him not be violent nor over anxious, not exacting nor obstinate, not jealous nor prone to suspicion, or else he will never be at rest. In all his commands, whether spiritual or temporal, let him be prudent and considerate. In the works which he imposeth let him be discreet and moderate, bearing in mind the discretion of holy Jacob, when he said: 'If I cause my flocks to be overdriven, they will all perish in one day'. Taking, then, such testimonies as are borne by these and the like words to discretion, the mother of virtues, let him so temper all things, that the strong may have something to strive after, and the weak nothing at which to take alarm.</blockquote>
