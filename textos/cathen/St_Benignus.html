<h1>St. Benignus</h1>  

<p>Date of birth unknown; d. 467, son of Sesenen, an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> chieftain in that part of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> which is now County Meath. He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, and became his favorite disciple and his coadjutor in the See of Armagh (450). His gentle and lovable disposition suggested the name Benen, which has been Latinized as Benignus. He followed his master in all his travels, and assisted him in his missionary labors, giving most valuable assistance in the formation of choral services. From his musical acquirements he was known as "Patrick's psalm-singer", and he drew thousands of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to Christ by his sweet voice. St. Benignus is said not only to have assisted in compiling the great <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> code of Laws, or <em>Senchus </em>Mor, but also to have contributed materials for the "Psalter of <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a>", and the "Book of Rights". He was present at the famous synod which passed the canon recognizing "the See Of the Apostle Peter" as the final court of appeal in difficult cases, which canon is to be found in the Book of Armagh. St. Benignus resigned his coadjutorship in 467 and died at the close of the same year. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on the 9th of November. Most authorities have identified <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick's</a> psalm-singer with the St. Benignus who founded Kilbannon, near <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, but it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, from Tirech&aacute;n's collections in the Book of Armagh, that St. Benignus of Armagh and St. Benignus of Kilbannon were two distinct <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. The former is described as son of Sesenen of County Meath, whilst the latter was son of Lugni of Connaught, yet both were contemporaries. St. Benignus of Kilbannon had a famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, where <a href="../cathen/08323c.htm">St. Jarlath</a> was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>, and he also presided over Drumlease. His sister, Mathona, was <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Tawney, in Tirerrill.
