<h1>St. Berach</h1>  

<p>Of Termonbarry, d. 595; a disciple of St. Kevin and a celebrated <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> saint, whose memory is still fresh in County Roscommon. He was of the tribe of Cinel Dobtha, or O'Hanley of Doohey Hanley, to which also belong the MacCoilidh <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Most of his long life was spent in the <a href="../cathen/05394b.htm">Diocese of Elphin</a> and he built his church at Cluain Coirpthe since known as Termonbarry or Kilbarry. His sister, St. Midabaria, was <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> at Bumlin (Strokestown), of which she is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as patroness on 22 February. Her ancient conventual church and graveyard are still to be seen. Under the title of "Berach of Cluain Coirpthe" St. Berach is honored in several <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a>, and his holy life attracted <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> to Kilbarry from all parts of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The MacCoilidh <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, whose name was anglicized to Cox in the early years of the seventeenth century, were hereditary custodians of St. Berach's <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>, and were <em>coarbs</em>, or <a href="../cathen/09092a.htm">lay abbots</a>, of Kilbarry. The <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a> is now in the Dublin Museum. In 1890, Dr. M. F. Cox, of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, the lineal representative of the MacCoilidhs, unearthed St. Berach's boat, and had it placed beside the present <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church of Whitehall, near Kilbarry. St. Berach's oratory at Cluain Coirpthe was replaced by a fine <em>damhliag</em> (stone church), built by MacCoilidh and O'Hanley in 916, and acquired the name of Termon Barry, or Kilbarry, that is the church of St. Berach. Some authorities give his feast as 11 February, but most martyrologists assign him 15 February. Kilbarrack Chureh, County Dublin, was also called after this <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, as in his early days he spent some time there and performed many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, duly recorded in his life. His bell was long preserved at the Abbey of Glendalough, but has disappeared since the sixteenth century.
