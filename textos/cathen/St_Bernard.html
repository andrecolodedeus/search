<h1>St. Bernard</h1>  

<p>(BARNARD.)

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Vienne, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Born in 778; died at Vienne, 23 January, 842. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, who lived near <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> and had large possessions, gave him an excellent <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and Bernard in obedience to the paternal wish, married and became a military officer under <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. After seven years as a soldier the death of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father and mother</a> recalled him. Dividing his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> into three parts &#151; one for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, one for the poor and one for his children &#151; he retired to the wilderness of Ambronay where there was a poor <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Bernard bought the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, enlarged it, and become one of its inmates. Upon the death of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> he was elected (805) to the vacant position. In 810 he was chosen <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Vienne to succeed Volf&egrave;re, but it was only upon the command of <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Pope Leo III</a> and of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> that he accepted the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Leidtrade, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, and distinguished himself by his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and learning. He took part in drawing up the Capitularies of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> and aided Agobard in a work upon Jewish <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a>.

<p>Bernard was a member of the Council of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (824) convoked by Louis the Pious, at the request of Eugenius II, in the hope of bringing about an agreement between the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and that of the East as to the devotion to be paid to images. Bernard took an unfortunate position in the quarrels between Louis the Pious and his sons over the partition of the empire between the three sons of his first marriage, to which the monarch had agreed. Like Agobard of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, Bernard sided with the oldest son, Lothair, and was one of the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who deposed the emperor at Compi&egrave;gne and condemned him to make a public penance. Louis soon regained his authority and another council of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> annulled the action of the one of Compi&egrave;gne. Agobard and Bernard were deposed, but the sentence of deposition was never carried out, owing to the intervention of Lothair, who had been reconciled to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. From this time on, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> devoted himself entirely to the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his pastoral office. Towards the end of his life he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> to retire to a solitary spot on the banks of the Is&egrave;re where stands today the town of Romans which owes its origin to him. On the approach of death he had himself removed to Vienne. He is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in Dauphiny as the <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of agricultural labourers.
