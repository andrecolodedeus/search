<h1>St. Bernard Tolomeo</h1>  

<p>Founder of the congregation of the Blessed Virgin of Monte Oliveto, born at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> in 1272; died in 1348. He received at <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the name of Giovanni, but took that of Bernard out of admiration for the saintly <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Clairvaux. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by his uncle, Christopher Tolorneo, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, and desired to enter the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, but his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> opposition prevented, and he continued his studies in secular surroundings. After a course in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> arid mathematics lie devoted himself to the study of civil and canon law, and of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. For a time Bernard served in the armies of Rudolph of Hapsburg. After his return to <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> he was appointed by his fellow citizens to the highest positions in the town government. While thus occupied he was struck with blindness. Having recovered his sight through the intervention of the Blessed Virgin he retired (1313) to a solitary spot about ten miles from <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, where he led a life of the greatest austerity.

<p>The fame of his virtues soon attracted many visitors, and Bernard was accused of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. He went to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> and cleared himself of this charge before <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> without difficulty. Upon his return he founded the congregation of the Blessed Virgin of Monte Oliveto, giving it the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>. The purpose of the new religious institute was a special <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to the Blessed Virgin</a>. Guido, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01702b.htm">Arezzo</a>, within whose diocese the congregation was formed, confirmed its constitution, (1319), and many favours were granted by Popes <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> (1344), and <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a>. Upon the appearance of the pest in the district of <a href="../cathen/01702b.htm">Arezzo</a>, Bernard and his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> devoted themselves to the care of the sick without any personal ill effects After having ruled the religious body he had founded for twenty-seven years Bernard died, at the age of seventy-six. His death was followed by many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and the congregation became a nursery of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. In 1634 the Congregation of Rites declared that the Blessed Bernard Tolomeo was deserving of veneration among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. In the Roman Martyrology he is commemorated on 21 August.
