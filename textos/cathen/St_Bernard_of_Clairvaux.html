<div id="springfield2">
<h1>St. Bernard of Clairvaux</h1>  

<p>Born in 1090, at Fontaines, near <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; died at <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a>, 21 August, 1153.

<p>His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were Tescelin, lord of Fontaines, and Aleth of Montbard, both belonging to the highest nobility of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. Bernard, the third of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of seven children, six of whom were sons, was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> with particular care, because, while yet unborn, a devout man had foretold his great destiny. At the age of nine years, Bernard was sent to a much renowned <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Chatillon-sur-Seine, kept by the secular canons of Saint-Vorles. He had a great taste for literature and devoted himself for some time to poetry. His success in his studies won the admiration of his masters, and his growth in virtue was no less marked. Bernard's great desire was to excel in literature in order to take up the study of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a>, which later on became, as it were, his own tongue. "Piety was his all," says <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>. He had a special devotion to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, and there is no one who speaks more sublimely of the Queen of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. Bernard was scarcely nineteen years of age when his mother died. During his youth, he did not escape trying <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, but his virtue triumphed over them, in many instances in a heroic manner, and from this time he thought of retiring from the world and living a life of solitude and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/13097d.htm">St. Robert</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Molesmes, had founded, in 1098, the <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">monastery of C&icirc;teaux</a>, about four leagues from <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a>, with the purpose of restoring the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a> in all its rigour. Returning to Molesmes, he left the government of the new <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> to St. Alberic, who died in the year 1109. St. Stephen had just succeeded him (1113) as third <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, when Bernard with thirty young noblemen of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, sought admission into the order. Three years later, St. Stephen sent the young Bernard, at the head of a band of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, the third to leave <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, to found a new house at Vall&eacute;e d'Absinthe, or Valley of Bitterness, in the <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Diocese of Langres</a>. This Bernard named Claire Vall&eacute;e, of <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a>, on the 25th of June, 1115, and the names of Bernard and <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a> thence became inseparable. During the absence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>, Bernard was blessed as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> by <a href="../cathen/15632a.htm">William of Champeaux</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons-sur-Marne</a>, who saw in him the predestined man, servum Dei. From that moment a strong friendship sprang up between the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who was professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at Notre Dame of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and the founder of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> of St. Victor.

<p>The beginnings of <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a> were trying and painful. The regime was so austere that Bernard's health was impaired by it, and only the influence of his friend <a href="../cathen/15632a.htm">William of Champeaux</a>, and the authority of the General Chapter could make him mitigate his austerities. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, however, made rapid progress. Disciples flocked to it in great numbers, desirous of putting themselves under the direction of Bernard. His father, the aged Tescelin, and all his brothers entered <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a> as religious, leaving only Humbeline, his sister, in the world and she, with the consent of her husband, soon took the veil in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Convent of Jully. <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a> becoming too small for the religious who crowded there, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to send out bands to found new houses. n 1118, the Monastery of the Three Fountains was founded in the Diocese of Ch&acirc;lons; in 1119, that of Fontenay in the Diocese of Auton (now Dijon) and in 1121, that of Foigny, near Vervins, in the Diocese of Laon (now <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>), Notwithstanding this prosperity, the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a> had his trials. During an absence from <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">Grand Prior</a> of Cluny, Bernard of Uxells, sent by the Prince of Priors, to use the expression of Bernard, went to <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a> and enticed away the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot's</a> cousin, Robert of Ch&acirc;tillon. This was the occasion of the longest, and most touching of Bernard's letters.

<p>In the year 1119, Bernard was present at the first general chapter of the order convoked by Stephen of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>. Though not yet thirty years old, Bernard was listened to with the greatest attention and respect, especially when he developed his thoughts upon the revival of the primitive spirit of regularity and fervour in all the monastic orders. It was this general chapter that gave definitive form to the constitutions of the order and the regulations of the "Charter of Charity" which <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Pope Callixtus II</a> confirmed 23 December, 1119. In 1120 Bernard composed his first work "De Gradibus Superbiae et Humilitatis" and his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> which he entitles "De Laudibus Mariae". The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Cluny had not seen, with satisfaction, those of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> take the first place among the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders for regularity and fervour. For this reason there was a temptation on the part of the "Black Monks" to make it appear that the rules of the new order were impracticable. At the solicitation of <a href="../cathen/15638a.htm">William of St. Thierry</a>, Bernard defended himself by publishing his "Apology" which is divided into two parts. In the first part he proves himself innocent of the invectives against Cluny, which had been attributed to him, and in the second he gives his reasons for his attack upon averred abuses. He protests his profound esteem for the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of Cluny whom he declares he loves equally as well as the other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. Peter the Venerable, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny, answered the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a> without wounding charity in the least, and assured him of his great admiration and sincere friendship. In the meantime Cluny established a reform, and <a href="../cathen/14326a.htm">Suger</a> himself, the minister of Louis le Gros, and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Denis, was converted by the apology of Bernard. He hastened to terminate his worldly life and restore discipline in his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Bernard did not stop here; it extended to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, and remarkable conversions of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> engaged in worldly pursuits were among the fruits of his labours. Bernard's letter to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a> is a real treatise "De Officiis Episcoporum". About the same time he wrote his work on "Grace and Free Will".



<p>In the year 1128, Bernard assisted at the Council of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, which had been convoked by Pope Honorius II, and was presided over by Cardinal Matthew, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a>. The purpose of this council was to settle certain disputes of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and regulate other matters of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> made Bernard secretary of the council, and charged him with drawing up the synodal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>. After the council, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a> was deposed. There then arose against Bernard <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> reproaches and he was denounced even in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> who meddled with matters that did not concern him. Cardinal Harmeric, on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, wrote Bernard a sharp letter of remonstrance. "It is not fitting" he said "that noisy and troublesome frogs should come out of their marshes to trouble the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>". Bernard answered the letter by saying that, if he had assisted at the council, it was because he had been dragged to it, as it were, by force. "Now illustrious Harmeric", he added, "if you so wished, who would have been more capable of freeing me from the necessity of assisting at the council than yourself? Forbid those noisy troublesome frogs to come out of their holes, to leave their marshes . . . Then your friend will no longer be exposed to the accusations of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and presumption". This letter made a great impression upon the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, and justified its author both in his eyes and before the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. It was at this council that Bernard traced the outlines of the Rule of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Knights Templars</a> who soon became the ideal of the French nobility. Bernard praises it in his "De Laudibus Novae Militiae".

<p>The influence of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a> was soon felt in provincial affairs. He defended the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against the encroachments of kings and princes, and recalled to their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> Henry <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>, and Stephen de Senlis, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. On the death of Honorius II, which occurred on the 14th of February, 1130, a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> broke out in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the election of two <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> and <a href="../cathen/01447a.htm">Anacletus II</a>. <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> having been banished from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Anacletus took refuge in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. King Louis le Gros convened a national council of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at Etampes, and Bernard, summoned thither by consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, was chosen to judge between the rival <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. He decided in favour of <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a>, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be recognized by all the great <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> powers, went with him into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, calmed the troubles that agitated the country, reconciled <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> with <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and Lothaire. According to the desire of the latter, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> went to <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> to consult with the emperor upon the best means to be taken for his return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, for it was there that Lothaire was to receive the imperial crown from the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. From <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, paid a visit to the <a href="../cathen/13343b.htm">Abbey of St. Denis</a>, and then to <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a> where his reception was of a simple and purely <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>. The whole pontifical court was touched by the saintly demeanor of this band of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. In the refectory only a few common fishes were found for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and instead of wine, the juice of herbs was served for drink, says an <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalist</a> of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>. It was not a table feast that was served to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and his followers, but a feast of virtues. The same year Bernard was again at the Council of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> at the side of <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/11264c.htm">oracle</a> he was; and then in Aquitaine where he succeeded for the time in detaching William, Count of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, from the cause of Anacletus.

<p>In 1132, Bernard accompanied <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and at Cluny the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> abolished the dues which <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a> used to pay to this celebrated <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>--an action which gave rise to a quarrel between the "White Monks" and the "Black Monks" which lasted twenty years. In the month of May, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> supported by the army of Lothaire, entered <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but Lothaire, feeling himself too weak to resist the partisans of Anacletus, retired beyond the Alps, and <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent</a> sought refuge in <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> in September, 1133. In the meantime the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> had returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in June, and was continuing the work of peacemaking which he had commenced in 1130. Towards the end of 1134, he made a second journey into Aquitaine, where William X had relapsed into <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. This would have died out of itself if William could have been detached from the cause of Gerard, who had usurped the <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">See of Bordeaux</a> and retained that of <a href="../cathen/01513b.htm">Angoul&ecirc;me</a>. Bernard invited William to the Mass which he celebrated in the Church of La Couldre. At the moment of the Communion, placing the <a href="../cathen/07489d.htm">Sacred Host</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a>, he went to the door of the church where William was, and pointing to the Host, he adjured the Duke not to despise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as he did His servants. William yielded and the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> ended. Bernard went again to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, where Roger of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> was endeavouring to withdraw the <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisans</a> from their allegiance to <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent</a>. He recalled the city of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, which had been deceived and misled by the ambitious <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> Anselm, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, to obedience to the pose, refused the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishopric</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and returned finally to <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a>. Believing himself at last secure in his <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> Bernard devoted himself with renewed vigour to the composition of those <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and learned works which have won for him the title of "Doctor of the Church". He wrote at this time his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> on the "Canticle of Canticles". In 1137 he was again forced to leave his solitude by order of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to put an end to the quarrel between Lothaire and Roger of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. At the conference held at <a href="../cathen/11419b.htm">Palermo</a>, Bernard succeeded in convincing Roger of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> and in silencing Peter of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> who sustained Anacletus. The latter died of grief and disappointment in 1138, and with him the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. Returning to <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a>, Bernard occupied himself in sending bands of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from his too-crowded <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> into <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Some of these, at the command of <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a>, took possession of Three Fountains Abbey, near the Salvian Waters in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, from which <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Pope Eugenius III</a> was chosen. Bernard resumed his commentary on the "Canticle of Canticles", assisted in 1139, at the Second General Lateran Council and the Tenth Oecumenical, in which the surviving adherents of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> were definitively condemned. About the same time, Bernard was visited at <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a> by St. Malachi, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and a very close friendship was formed between them. St. Malachi would gladly have taken the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> habit, but the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> would not give his permission. He died, however, at <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a> in 1148.

<p>In the year 1140, we find Bernard engaged in other matters which disturbed the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Towards the close of the eleventh century, the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, dominated by the passion for discussion and a spirit of independence which had introduced itself into political and religious questions, became a veritable public arena, with no other motive than that of <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>. This exaltation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> found an ardent and powerful adherent in <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a>, the most eloquent and learned man of the age after Bernard. "The history of the calamities and the refutation of his doctrine by St. Bernard", says <a href="../cathen/12659b.htm">Ratisbonne</a>, "form the greatest episode of the twelfth century". <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard's</a> treatise on the Trinity had been condemned in 1121, and he himself had thrown his book into the fire. But in 1139 he advocated new <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. Bernard, informed of this by <a href="../cathen/15638a.htm">William of St. Thierry</a>, wrote to <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> who answered in an insulting manner. Bernard then denounced him to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> who caused a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> to be held at <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>. <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> asked for a public discussion with Bernard; the latter showed his opponent's <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> with such clearness and force of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> that he was unable to make any reply, and was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a>, after being condemned, to retire. he <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> confirmed the judgment of the council, <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> submitted without resistance, and retired to Cluny to live under Peter the Venerable, where he died two years later.

<p><a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> died in 1143. His two successors, Celestin II and Lucius, reigned only a short time, and then Bernard saw one of his disciples, Bernard of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, Abbott of Three Fountains, and known thereafter as Eugenius III, raised to the Chair of St. Peter. Bernard sent him, at his own request, various instructions which compose the "Book of Consideration", the predominating <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of which is that the reformation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ought to commence with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of the head. Temporal matters are merely accessories; the principal are <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, meditation, or consideration, which ought to precede action. The book contains a most beautiful page on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, and has always been greatly esteemed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiffs</a>, many of whom used it for their ordinary reading.

<p>Alarming news came at this time from the East. <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> had fallen into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and Antioch were threatened with similar disaster. Deputations of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> solicited aid from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> also sent ambassadors. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> commissioned Bernard to preach a new <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> and granted the same <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> for it which <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> had accorded to the first. A parliament was convoked at V&eacute;zelay in <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> in 1146, and Bernard preached before the assembly. The King, Louis le Jeune, Queen Eleanor, and the princes and lords present prostrated themselves at the feet of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a> to receive the cross. The saint was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to use portions of his habit to make crosses to satisfy the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and ardour of the multitude who wished to take part in the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a>. Bernard passed into <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which multiplied almost at his every step undoubtedly contributed to the success of his mission. The Emperor Conrad and his nephew <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a>, received the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims'</a> cross from the hand of Bernard, and Pope Eugenius, to encourage the enterprise, came in person to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. It was on the occasion of this visit, 1147, that a council was held at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, at which the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/06555a.htm">Gilbert de la Por&eacute;e</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, were examined. He advanced among other absurdities that the essence and the <a href="../cathen/02062e.htm">attributes of God</a> are not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the properties of the Persons of the Trinity are not the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> themselves in fine that the Divine Nature did not become incarnate. The discussion was warm on both sides. The decision was left for the council which was held at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> the following year (1148), and in which Eon de l'Etoile was one of the judges. Bernard was chosen by the council to draw up a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> directly opposed to that of Gilbert, who concluding by stating to the Fathers: "If you believe and assert differently than I have done I am willing to believe and speak as you do". The consequence of this declaration was that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> condemned the assertions of Gilbert without denouncing him personally. After the council the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> paid a visit to <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a>, where he held a general chapter of the order and was able to realize the prosperity of which Bernard was the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p>The last years of Bernard's life were saddened by the failure of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> he had preached, the entire responsibility for which was thrown upon him. He had accredited the enterprise by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, but he had not guaranteed its success against the misconduct and perfidy of those who participated in it. Lack of discipline and the over-confidence of the German troops, the intrigues of the Prince of Antioch and Queen Eleanor, and finally the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> and evident treason of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> nobles of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, who prevented the capture of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, appear to have been the cause of disaster. Bernard considered it his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to send an apology to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and it is inserted in the second part of his "Book of Consideration". There he explains how, with the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> as with the Hebrew people, in whose favour the Lord had multiplies his prodigies, their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were the cause of their misfortune and miseries. The death of his contemporaries served as a warning to Bernard of his own approaching end The first to die was <a href="../cathen/14326a.htm">Suger</a> (1152), of whom the Abbot wrote to <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugenius III</a>: "If there is any precious vase adorning the palace of the King of Kings it is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the venerable <a href="../cathen/14326a.htm">Suger</a>". Thibaud, Count of Champagne, Conrad, Emperor of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and his son Henry died the same year. From the beginning of the year 1153 Bernard felt his death approaching. The passing of Pope Eugenius had struck the fatal blow by taking from him one whom he considered his greatest friend and consoler. Bernard died in the sixty-third year of his age, after forty years spent in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. He founded one hundred and sixty-three <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in different parts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>; at his death they numbered three hundred and forty-three. He was the first <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> placed on the calendar of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, 18 January 1174. <a href="../cathen/12134a.htm">Pope Pius VIII</a> bestowed on him the title of <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctor of the Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> him as only the founders of orders are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a>, because of the wonderful and widespread activity which he gave to the Order of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>.

<p>The works of St. Bernard are as follows: <ul><li>"De Gradibus Superbiae", his first treatise; <li>"Homilies on the Gospel 'Missus est'" (1120); <li>"Apology to <a href="../cathen/15638a.htm">William of St. Thierry</a>" against the claims of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Cluny; <li>"On the Conversion of Clerics", a book addressed to the young <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1122); <li>"De Laudibus Novae Militiae", addressed to Hughes de Payns, first Grand Master and Prior of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (1129). This is a eulogy of the <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military order</a> instituted in 1118, and an exhortation to the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> to conduct themselves with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> in their several stations. <li>"De amore Dei" wherein St. Bernard shows that the manner of loving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him without measure and gives the different degree of this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; <li>"Book of Precepts and Dispensations" (1131), which contains answers to questions upon certain points of the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a> from which the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> can, or cannot, dispense; <li>"De Grati&acirc; et Libero Arbitrio" in which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of grace and <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> according to the principles of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>; <li>"Book of Considerations", addressed to <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Pope Eugenius III</a>; <li>"De Officiis Episcoporum", addressed to Henry, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>.</ul>

<p>His sermons are also numerous: <ul><li>"On Psalm 90, 'Qui habitat'" (about 1125); <li>"On the Canticle of Canticles". St. Bernard explained in eighty-six sermons only the first two chapters of the <a href="../bible/son000.htm">Canticle of Canticles</a> and the first verse of the third chapter. <li>There are also eighty-six "Sermons for the Whole Year"; his "Letters" number 530.</ul>

<p>Many other letters, treatises, etc., falsely attributed to him are found among his works, such as the "l'Echelle du Clo&icirc;tre", which is the work of <a href="../cathen/07066a.htm">Guigues</a>, Prior of La Grande Chartreuse, les M&eacute;ditations, l'Edification de la Maison int&eacute;rieure, etc.
