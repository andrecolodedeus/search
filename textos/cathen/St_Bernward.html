<h1>St. Bernward</h1>  

<p>Thirteenth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, b. about the middle of the tenth century; d. 20 November, 1022. He claimed descent from a noble Saxon <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, which counted among its members men of distinction in <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. His grandfather was Athelbero, Count Palatine of Saxony. Having lost his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> at an early age, he came under the care of his uncle Volkmar, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, who entrusted his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> to <a href="../cathen/14554b.htm">Thangmar</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and learned director of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/07196a.htm">Heidelberg</a>. Under this master, Bernward made rapid progress in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> as well as in the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> and in the liberal and even mechanical arts. He became very proficient in mathematics, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, architecture, and particularly in the manufacture of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> vessels and ornaments of silver and gold. He completed his studies at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by Archbishop Willigis, Chancellor of the Empire (975-1011). He declined a valuable preferment in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of his uncle, Bishop Volkmar, and chose to remain with his grandfather, Athelbero, to comfort him in his old age. Upon the death of the latter, in 987, he became <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> at the imperial court, and was shortly afterwards appointed by the Empress-Regent Theophano, tutor to her son <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a>, then six years of age. The youthful emperor is known to have been a learned and religious prince, for which he was indebted in no small degree to his instructor.

<p>Bernward remained at the imperial court until 993, when he was elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>. His long episcopate of nearly thirty years was prolific of great results for the <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Diocese of Hildesheim</a>. <a href="../cathen/14554b.htm">Thangmar</a>, his former tutor, who subsequently became his biographer, describes in eloquent terms, how the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, after performing his episcopal functions in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, was wont to visit the various workshops connected with the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and with his own hands manufactured gold and silver vessels for the enrichment of the altars. Under his direction arose numerous churches and other edifices, including even fortifications for the defence of his episcopal city against the invasions of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> Normans. As evidences of his skill in the practice of the mechanical arts there are still preserved in Hildesheim a cross of rich and exquisite workmanship, known as the "Bernward Cross", the famous Bernward column, with winding reliefs representing scenes from the life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, two bronze doors of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, showing Scriptural scenes, and two candlesticks symbolic of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the light of the world. A monument of his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and skill is St. Michael's abbey-church at <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a> &#151; now <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> &#151; one of the most magnificent <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and practice of the arts were wholly employed in the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. A man of extraordinary <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, he was much given to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and the practice of <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>. Shortly before his death in 1022 he had himself invested with the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> habit. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/03478b.htm">Pope Celestine III</a> in 1193. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> occurs on 20 November.</p>
