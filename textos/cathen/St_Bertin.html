<h1>St. Bertin</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251a.htm">St. Omer</a>, b. near <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> about 615; d. about 709. At an early age he entered the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09467a.htm">Luxeuil</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> where, under the austere Rule of St. Columban, he prepared himself for his future missionary career. About the year 638 he set out, in company with two confr&egrave;res, Mummolin and Ebertram, for the extreme northern part of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in order to assist his friend and kinsman, Bishop <a href="../cathen/11251a.htm">St. Omer</a>, in the evangelization of the Morini. This country, now in the Department Pas-de-Calais, was then one vast marsh, studded here and there with hillocks and overgrown with seaweed and bulrushes. On one of these hillocks, Bertin and his companions built a small house whence they went out daily to preach the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> among the natives, most of whom were still <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>. Gradually some converted <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> joined the little band of missionaries and a larger <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> had to be built. A tract of land called Sithiu had been donated to Omer by a converted nobleman named Adrowald. Omer now turned this whole tract over to the missionaries, who selected a suitable place on it for their new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. But the community grew so rapidly that in a short time this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> also became too small and another was built where the city of <a href="../cathen/11251a.htm">St. Omer</a> now stands. Shortly after Bertin's death it received the name of St. Bertin. Mummolin, perhaps because he was the oldest of the missionaries, was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> until he succeeded the deceased <a href="../cathen/05386a.htm">St. Eligius</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Noyon, about the year 659. Bertin then became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. The fame of Bertin's learning and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> was so great that in a short time more than 150 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> lived under his rule, among them <a href="../cathen/15658a.htm">St. Winnoc</a> and his three companions who had come from Brittany to join Bertin's community and assist in the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. When nearly the whole neighbourhood was <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">Christianized</a>, and the marshy land transformed into a fertile plain, Bertin, knowing that his death was not far off, appointed Rigobert, a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, as his successor, while he himself spent the remainder of his life preparing for a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> death. Bertin began to be <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a saint soon after his death. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 5 September. In <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a> the Abbey of St. Bertin was famous as a centre of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and learning. The "Annales Bertiniani" (830-882; Mon. Germ. Hist.: Script., I, 419-515) are important for the contemporary history of the West Frankish Kingdom. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church, now in ruins, was one of the finest fourteenth-century Gothic edifices. In later times its <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, archives, and art-treasures were renowned both in and out of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were expelled in 1791 and in 1799 the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and its church were sold at auction. The valuable charters of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> are published in <a href="../cathen/07059a.htm">Gu&eacute;rard</a>, "Cartulaire de l'abbaye de St. Bertin" (Paris, 1841; appendix by Morand, ibid., 1861). The list of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> is given in <a href="../cathen/06350c.htm">"Gallia Christiana nova"</a>, III, 485 sqq. See Laplane, "Abb&eacute;s de St. Bertin" (St. Omer, 1854-55).
