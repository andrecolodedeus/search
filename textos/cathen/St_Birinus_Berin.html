<h1>St. Birinus (Berin)</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/04215a.htm">Confessor</a>, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dorchester (in what is now the County of Oxford, not Dorchester, the capital of Dorsetshire), and Apostle of Wessex; <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; died 3 December, 650, at his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> and was buried in his own church there. Later (680) his remains were deposited by Bishop Headda in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, where finally (4 September, 972) <a href="../cathen/05555b.htm">Bishop Ethelwold</a> enshrined them in silver and gold. According to <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, Birinus came to Britain on the advice of Pope Honorius I (625-638), having been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by Asterius at <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>. He promised "to sow the seed of the holy faith in the inner parts beyond the English", but on his arrival (634) found the West Saxons so <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> that he decided to devoted his ministry to them. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> blessed his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> by the conversion of their king, Cynegils (635), of his son Cwichelm (636), and of Cwichelm's son Cuthred (639). Cynegils' daughter (Cyneburga?) was also <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and Oswald, the holy King of Northumbria, who had come to Cynegils in suit of her hand, was sponsor to her father and wedded her. Doubtless his presence helped Birinus much in his first spiritual conquests. Immediately after this, Oswald and Cynegils gave him Dorcic, or Dorchester, the capital of Wessex, for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, where "he built and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and by his labours called many to the Lord".

<p>Birinus had great devotion for the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Body of Our Lord</a>, as is shown in the account of his walking on the sea to procure the corporal given him by Pope Honorius, wherein he ever carried the Blessed Eucharist. Field strangely disposes of this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> and others as allegorical or fabricated, after allowing, however, that their chroniclers had some common source of information lost to us now. Many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> took place at the discovery of Birinus's <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, and Huntingdon among others speaks of "the great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of Birin". At present, there is a growing devotion to him in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Established Church</a>. due probably to the connection of the royal family with Cedric, a side branch of whose stock was Cynegils. Field enumerates many modern <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> memorials. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Dorchester <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> their patron, in, 1849, with a beautiful <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>.
