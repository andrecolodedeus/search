<h1>St. Boisil</h1>  

<p>Superior of Melrose Abbey, d. 664. Almost all that is known of St. Boisil is learnt from <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> (Eccles. Hist., IV, xxvii, and Vita Cuthberti). He derived his information from Sigfrid, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Jarrow, who had previously been trained by Boisil at <a href="../cathen/10170a.htm">Melrose</a>. St. Boisil's fame is mainly due to his connection with his great pupil, <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a>, but it is plain that the master was worthy of the disciple. Contemporaries were deeply impressed with Boisil's <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuitions</a>. When Cuthbert presented himself at <a href="../cathen/10170a.htm">Melrose</a>, Boisil exclaimed "Behold a servant of the Lord", and he obtained leave from Abbot Eata to receive him into the community at once. When in the great pestilence of 664 Cuthbert was stricken down, Boisil declared he would certainly recover. Somewhat later Boisil himself as he had foretold three years before, fell a victim to this terrible epidemic, but before the end came he predicted that Cuthbert would become a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and would effect great things for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. After his death Boisil appeared twice in a vision to his former disciple, Bishop Ecgberht. He is believed, on somewhat dubious authority, to have written certain <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works, but they have not been preserved. St. Boswell's, Roxburghshire, commemorates his name. His <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, like those of <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede</a>, were carried off to Durham in the eleventh century by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> &AElig;lfred. In the early Calendars his day is assigned to 23 February, but the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> treat of him on 9 September.
