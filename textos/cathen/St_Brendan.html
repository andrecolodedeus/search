<h1>St. Brendan</h1>  

<p>St. Brendan of Ardfert and <a href="../cathen/04064b.htm">Clonfert</a>, known also as Brendan the Voyager, was born in Ciarraighe Luachra, near the present city of Tralee, County Kerry, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, in 484; he died at Enachduin, now Annaghdown, in 577. He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at Tubrid, near Ardfert, by Bishop Erc. For five years he was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> under <a href="../cathen/08201c.htm">St. Ita</a>, "the Brigid of Munster", and he completed his studies under St. Erc, who <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> him <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 512. Between the years 512 and 530 St. Brendan built monastic cells at Ardfert, and at Shanakeel or Baalynevinoorach, at the foot of Brandon Hill. It was from here that he set out on his famous voyage for the Land of Delight. The old <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Calendars assigned a special feast for the "Egressio familiae S. Brendani", on 22 March; and St Aengus the Culdee, in his Litany, at the close of the eighth century, invokes "the sixty who accompanied St. Brendan in his quest of the Land of Promise". Naturally, the story of the seven years' voyage was carried about, and, soon, crowds of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> and students flocked to Ardfert. Thus, in a few years, many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> were formed at Gallerus, Kilmalchedor, Brandon Hill, and the Blasquet Islands, in order to meet the wants of those who came for spiritual guidance to St. Brendan.

<p>Having established the See of Ardfert, St. Brendan proceeded to Thomond, and founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Inis-da-druim (now Coney Island, County Clare), in the present <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Killadysert, about the year 550. He then journeyed to <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, and thence to <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a>, and left traces of his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a> at Kilbrandon (near Oban) and Kilbrennan Sound. After a three years' mission in Britain he returned to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and did much good work in various parts of Leinster, especially at Dysart (Co. Kilkenny), Killiney (Tubberboe), and Brandon Hill. He founded the Sees of Ardfert, and of Annaghdown, and established churches at Inchiquin, County <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a>, and at Inishglora, County Mayo. His most celebrated foundation was <a href="../cathen/04064b.htm">Clonfert</a>, in 557, over which he appointed St. Moinenn as Prior and Head Master. St. Brendan was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in <a href="../cathen/04064b.htm">Clonfert</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 16 May.
<h2>Voyage of St. Brendan</h2>

<p>St. Brendan belongs to that glorious period in the history of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> when the island in the first glow of its conversion to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> sent forth its earliest messengers of the Faith to the continent and to the regions of the sea. It is, therefore, perhaps possible that the <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">legends</a>, current in the ninth and committed to writing in the eleventh century, have for foundation an actual sea-voyage the destination of which cannot however be determined. These adventures were called the "Navigatio Brendani", the Voyage or Wandering of St. Brendan, but there is no historical <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this journey. Brendan is said to have sailed in search of a fabled <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Paradise</a> with a company of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, the number of which is variously stated as from 18 to 150. After a long voyage of seven years they reached the "Terra Repromissionis", or <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Paradise</a>, a most beautiful land with luxuriant vegetation. The narrative offers a wide range for the interpretation of the geographical position of this land and with it of the scene of the <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">legend</a> of St. Brendan. On the Catalonian chart (1375) it is placed not very far west of the southern part of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. On other charts, however, it is identified with the "Fortunate Isles" of the ancients and is placed towards the south. Thus it is put among the <a href="../cathen/03243a.htm">Canary Islands</a> on the Herford chart of the world (beginning of the fourteenth century); it is substituted for the island of Madeira on the chart of the Pizzigani (1367), on the Weimar chart (1424), and on the chart of Beccario (1435). As the increase in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this region <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the former <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> the island was pushed further out into the ocean. It is found 60 degrees west of the first meridian and very near the equator on <a href="../cathen/02391b.htm">Martin Behaim's</a> globe. The inhabitants of Ferro, Gomera, Madeira, and the <a href="../cathen/02168a.htm">Azores</a> positively declared to <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> that they had often seen the island and continued to make the assertion up to a far later period. At the end of the sixteenth century the failure to find the island led the cartographers Apianus and <a href="../cathen/11328b.htm">Ortelius</a> to place it once more in the ocean west of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; finally, in the early part of the nineteenth century <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the existence of the island was completely abandoned. But soon a new theory arose, maintained by those scholars who claim for the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> the glory of discovering America, namely, MacCarthy, Rafn, Beamish, <a href="../cathen/11224d.htm">O'Hanlon</a>, Beauvois, Gafarel, etc. They rest this claim on the account of the <a href="../cathen/11115b.htm">Northmen</a> who found a region south of Vinland and the Chesapeake Bay called "Hvitramamaland" (Land of the White Men) or "Irland ed mikla" (Greater <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>), and on the tradition of the Shawano (Shawnee) Indians that in earlier times <a href="../cathen/06115b.htm">Florida</a> was inhabited by a white tribe which had iron implements. In regard to Brendan himself the point is made that he could only have gained a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of foreign animals and plants, such as are described in the legend, by visiting the western continent. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> was very early expressed as to the value of the narrative for the history of discovery. <a href="../cathen/07461a.htm">Honorius of Augsburg</a> declared that the island had vanished; <a href="../cathen/15439a.htm">Vincent of Beauvais</a> denied the authenticity of the entire <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> do not recognize it. Among the geographers, Alexander von Humboldt, Peschel, Ruge, and Kretschmer, place the story among geographical legends, which are of interest for the history of civilization but which can lay no claim to serious consideration from the point of view of geography. The oldest account of the legend is in Latin, "Navigatio Sancti Brendani", and belongs to the tenth or eleventh century; the first French translation dates from 1125; since the thirteenth century the legend has appeared in the literatures of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. A list of the numerous <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> is given by Hardy, "Descriptive Catalogue of Materials Relating to the History of Great Britain and Ireland" (London, 1862), I, 159 sqq. Editions have been issued by : Jubinal, "La Legende latine de S. Brandaines avec une traduction inedite en prose et en po&eacute;sie romanes" (Paris, 1836); Wright, "St. Brandan, a Medieval Legend of the Sea, in English Verse, and Prose" (London, 1844); C. Schroder, "Sanct Brandan, ein latinischer und drei deutsche Texte" (Erlangen, 1871); Brill, "Van Sinte Brandane" (Gronningen, 1871); Francisque Michel, Les Voyages merveilleux de Saint Brandan a la recherche du paradis terrestre" (Paris, 1878); Fr. Novati, "La Navigatio Sancti Brandani in antico Veneziano" (Bergamo, 1892); E. Bonebakker, "Van Sente Brandane" (Amsterdam, 1894); Carl Wahland gives a list of the rich literature on the subject and the old French prose translation of Brendan's voyage (Upsala, 1900), XXXVI-XC.
