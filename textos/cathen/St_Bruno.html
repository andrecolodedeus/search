<h1>St. Bruno</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13683b.htm">Segni</a>, in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, born at Solero, <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, about 1048; died 1123. He received his preliminary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of his native town. After completing his studies at Bologna and receiving <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, he was made a canon of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienna</a>. In appreciation of his great learning and eminent <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, he was called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where, as an able and prudent counsellor, his advice was sought by four successive <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. At a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1079 he <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius of Tours</a>, who denied the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">real presence of Our Lord</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> to retract his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. He enjoyed the personal friendship of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13683b.htm">Segni</a> by him in the Campagna of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in 1080. His <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to decline the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>. He is called "the brilliant defender of the church" because of the invincible <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> he evinced in aiding <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> and the succeeding <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> in their efforts for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform, and especially in denouncing lay investiture, which he even declared to be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>.

<p>He accompanied <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Pope Urban II</a> in 1095, to the Council of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> in which the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section1">First Crusade</a> was inaugurated. In 1102 he became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Monte Casino and was elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> in 1107, without, however, resigning his episcopal charge. With many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Bruno rejected the treaty known in history as the "Privilegium", which Henry V of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> had extorted from <a href="../cathen/11514b.htm">Pope Paschal II</a> during his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. In a letter addressed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> he very frankly censured him for concluding a convention which conceded to the German king in part the inadmissible claim to the right of investiture of ring and <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a> upon <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and demanded that the treaty should be annulled. Irritated by his opposition, Paschal II commanded Bruno to give up his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and to return to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. With untiring <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> he continued to labour for the welfare of his flock, as well as for the common interest of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at large, till his death. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Pope Lucius III in 1183. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on the 18th of July. St. Bruno was the author of numerous works, chiefly Scriptural. Of these are to be mentioned his commentaries on the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>, the Book of Job, the Psalms, the four Gospels, and the Apocalypse.
