<h1>St. Bruno</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/04215a.htm">Confessor</a>, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer, and founder of the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian Order</a>. He was born at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a> about the year 1030; died 6 October, 1101. He is usually represented with a death's head in his hands, a book and a cross, or <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with seven stars; or with a roll bearing the device <em>O Bonitas</em>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on the 6th of October.

<p>According to tradition, <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> belonged to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Hartenfaust, or Hardeb&uuml;st, one of the principal <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the city, and it is in remembrance of this origin that different members of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Hartenfaust have received from the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> either some special <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers for the dead</a>, as in the case of Peter Bruno Hartenfaust in 1714, and Louis Alexander Hartenfaust, Baron of Laach, in 1740; or a personal affiliation with the order, as with Louis Bruno of Hardev&uuml;st, Baron of Laach and Burgomaster of the town of Bergues-S. Winnoc, in the <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Diocese of Cambrai</a>, with whom the Hardev&uuml;st <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in the male line became extinct on 22 March, 1784.

<p>We have little information about the childhood and youth of <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a>. Born at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, he would have studied at the city college, or collegial of St. Cunibert. While still quite young (<em>a pueris</em>) he went to complete his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, attracted by the reputation of the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and of its director, Heriman. There he finished his classical studies and perfected himself in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred sciences</a> which at that time consisted principally of the study of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and of the <a href="../fathers/index.html">Fathers</a>. He became there, according to the testimony of his contemporaries, learned both in human and in Divine <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>.

<p>His <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> completed, <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> returned to <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, where he was provided with a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> at St. Cunibert's, and, according to the most probable opinion, was elevated to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dignity. This was about the year 1055. In 1056 Bishop Gervais recalled him to <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, to aid his former master Heriman in the direction of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The latter was already turning his attention towards a more perfect form of life, and when he at last left the world to enter the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, in 1057, <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> found himself head of the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, or <em>&eacute;col&acirc;tre</em>, a post difficult as it was elevated, for it then included the direction of the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and the oversight of all the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational establishments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. For about twenty years, from 1057 to 1075, he maintained the prestige which the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> has attained under its former masters, <a href="../cathen/12764a.htm">Remi of Auxerre</a>, <a href="../cathen/07510b.htm">Hucbald of St. Amand</a>, Gerbert, and lastly Heriman. Of the excellence of his teaching we have a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> in the funereal titles composed in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, which celebrate his eloquence, his poetic, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a>, and above all his <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, talents; and also in the merits of his pupils, amongst whom were Eudes of Ch&acirc;tillon, afterwards <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a>, Rangier, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12717a.htm">Reggio</a>, Robert, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>, and a large number of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>.

<p>In 1075 <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> was appointed chancellor of the church of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, and had then to give himself especially to the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Bishop Gervais, friend of <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a>, had been succeeded by Manasses de Gournai, who quickly became odious for his impiety and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. The chancellor and two other canons were commissioned to bear to the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, Hugh of Die, the complaints of the indignant <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and at the Council of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, 1077, they obtained the suspension of the unworthy <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>. The latter's reply was to raze the houses of his accusers, confiscate their goods, sell their <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, and appeal to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Bruno then absented himself from <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> for a while, and went probably to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to defend the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of his cause. It was only in 1080 that a definite sentence, confirmed by a rising of the people, compelled Manasses to withdraw and take refuge with the <a href="../cathen/07230a.htm">Emperor Henry IV</a>. Free then to choose another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were on the point of uniting their vote upon the chancellor. He, however, had far different designs in view. According to a tradition preserved in the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian Order</a>, Bruno was persuaded to abandon the world by the sight of a celebrated prodigy, popularized by the brush of Lesueur--the triple resurrection of the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Parisian</a> doctor, Raymond Diocres. To this tradition may be opposed the silence of contemporaries, and of the first biographers of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>; the silence of Bruno himself in his letter to Raoul le Vert, Provost of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>; and the impossibility of proving that he ever visited <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He had no need of such an extraordinary argument to cause him to leave the world. Some time before, when in conversation with two of his friends, Raoul and Fulcius, canons of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> like himself, they had been so enkindled with the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the desire of eternal goods that they had made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to abandon the world and to embrace the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. This <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, uttered in 1077, could not be put into execution until 1080, owing to various circumstances.



<p>The first <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> on leaving <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> seems to have been to place himself and his companions under the direction of an eminent solitary, St. Robert, who had recently (1075) settled at <a href="../cathen/10433b.htm">Molesme</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Diocese of Langres</a>, together with a band of other solitaries who were later on (1098) to form the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian Order</a>. But he soon found that this was not his vocation, and after a short sojourn at S&egrave;che-Fontaine near Molesme, he left two of his companions, Peter and Lambert, and betook himself with six others to Hugh of Ch&acirc;teauneuf, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, and, according to some authors, one of his pupils. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had shown these men in a dream, under the image of seven stars, conducted and installed them himself (1084) in a wild spot on the Alps of Dauphin&eacute; named Chartreuse, about four leagues from <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, in the midst of precipitous rocks and mountains almost always covered with snow. With <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> were Landuin, the two Stephens of Bourg and Die, canons of Sts. Rufus, and Hugh the Chaplain, "all, the most learned men of their time", and two <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, Andrew and Gu&eacute;rin, who afterwards became the first <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>. They built a little <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> where they lived in deep retreat and poverty, entirely occupied in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and study, and frequently <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by the visits of <a href="../cathen/07515b.htm">St. Hugh</a> who became like one of themselves. Their manner of life has been recorded by a contemporary, Guibert of Nogent, who visited them in their solitude. (De Vit&acirc; su&acirc;, I, ii.)

<p>Meanwhile, another pupil of <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a>, Eudes of Ch&acirc;tillon, had become <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name of <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> (1088). Resolved to continue the work of reform commenced by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, and being <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to struggle against the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Guibert of Ravenna</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07230a.htm">Emperor Henry IV</a>, he sought to surround himself with devoted allies and called his ancient master <em>ad Sedis Apostolicae servitium</em>. Thus the solitary found himself <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave the spot where he had spent more than six years in retreat, followed by a part of his community, who could not make up their minds to live separated from him (1090). It is difficult to assign the place which he then occupied at the pontifical court, or his influence in contemporary events, which was entirely hidden and confidential. Lodged in the palace of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself and admitted to his councils, and charged, moreover, with other collaborators, in preparing matters for the numerous councils of this period, we must give him some credit for their results. But he took care always to keep himself in the background, and although he seems to have assisted at the Council of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> (March, 1091), we find no evidence of his having been present at the Councils of Troja (March, 1093), of <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a> (March, 1095), or of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> (November, 1095). His part in history is effaced. All that we can say with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> is that he seconded with all his power the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> in his efforts for the reform of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, efforts inaugurated at the Council of Melfi (1089) and continued at that of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>. A short time after the arrival of <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had been <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to abandon <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> before the victorious forces of the emperor and the <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">antipope</a>. He withdrew with all his court to the south of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>.

<p>During the voyage, the former professor of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> attracted the attention of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/12717a.htm">Reggio</a> in further Calabria, which had just lost its <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> Arnulph (1090), and their votes were given to him. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the Norman prince, Roger, Duke of Apulia, strongly approved of the election and pressed <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> to accept it. In a similar juncture at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> he had escaped by flight; this time he again escaped by causing Rangier, one of his former pupils, to be elected, who was fortunately near by at the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of La Cava near <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a>. But he feared that such attempts would be renewed; moreover he was weary of the agitated life imposed upon him, and solitude ever invited him. He begged, therefore, and after much trouble obtained, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> permission to return again to his solitary life. His intention was to rejoin his brethren in Dauphin&eacute;, as a letter addressed to them makes clear. But the will of <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> kept him in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, near the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court, to which he could be called at need. The place chosen for his new retreat by <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> and some followers who had joined him was in the <a href="../cathen/14239a.htm">Diocese of Squillace</a>, on the eastern slope of the great chain which crosses Calabria from north to south, and in a high valley three miles long and two in width, covered with forest. The new solitaries constructed a little <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of planks for their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> reunions and, in the depths of the woods, cabins covered with mud for their habitations. A legend says that <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> whilst at <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was discovered by the hounds of Roger, Great Count of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and Calabria and uncle of the Duke of Apulia, who was then hunting in the neighbourhood, and who thus learnt to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and venerate him; but the count had no need to wait for that occasion to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him, for it was probably upon his invitation that the new solitaries settled upon his domains. That same year (1091) he visited them, made them a grant of the lands they occupied, and a close friendship was formed between them. More than once <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> went to Mileto to take part in the joys and sorrows of the noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, to visit the count when sick (1098 and 1101), and to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> his son Roger (1097), the future Kind of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. But more often it was Roger who went into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> to visit his friends, and when, through his generosity, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Stephen was built, in 1095, near the hermitage of St. Mary, there was erected adjoining it a little country house at which he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> to pass the time left free from governing his State.

<p>Meanwhile the friends of <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> died one after the other: <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> in 1099; Landuin, the <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the Grand Chartreuse, his first companion, in 1100; Count Roger in 1101. His own time was near at hand. Before his death he gathered for the last time his brethren round him and made in their presence a profession of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, the words of which have been preserved. He affirms with special emphasis his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">the mystery of the Holy Trinity</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">real presence of Our Saviour</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>--a protestation against the two <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> which had troubled that century, the <a href="../cathen/15061b.htm">tritheism</a> of <a href="../cathen/13189c.htm">Roscelin</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07694a.htm">impanation</a> of <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a>. After his death, the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> of Calabria, following a frequent custom of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> by which the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a> was associated with the death of its <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, dispatched a <em>rolliger</em>, a servant of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> laden with a long roll of parchment, hung round his neck, who passed through <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. He stopped at the principal churches and communities to announce the death, and in return, the churches, communities, or chapters inscribed upon his roll, in prose or verse, the expression of their regrets, with promises of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Many of these rolls have been preserved, but few are so extensive or so full of praise as that about <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a>. A hundred and seventy-eight witnesses, of whom many had known the deceased, celebrated the extent of his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and the fruitfulness of his instruction. Strangers to him were above all struck by his great <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and talents. But his disciples praised his three chief virtues--his great spirit of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, an extreme <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, and a filial <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to the Blessed Virgin</a>. Both the churches built by him in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> were dedicated to the Blessed Virgin: Our Lady of Casalibus in Dauphin&eacute;, Our Lady Della Torre in Calabria; and, faithful to his inspirations, the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> Statutes proclaim the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> the first and chief patron of all the houses of the order, whoever may be their particular patron.

<p>St. Bruno was buried in the little cemetery of the hermitage of St. Mary, and many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were worked at his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. He had never been formally <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>. His cult, authorized for the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian Order</a> by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> in 1514, was extended to the whole church by <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a>, 17 February, 1623, as a semi-double feast, and elevated to the class of doubles by <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a>, 14 March, 1674. <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> is the popular saint of Calabria; every year a great multitude resort to the Charterhouse of St. Stephen, on the Monday and Tuesday of Pentecost, when his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are borne in procession to the hermitage of St. Mary, where he lived, and the people visit the spots sanctified by his presence. An immense number of <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medals</a> are struck in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and distributed to the crowd, and the little <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> habits, which so many children of the neighbourhood wear, are blessed. He is especially invoked, and successfully, for the deliverance of those possessed.

<p>As a writer and founder of an order, <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> occupies an important place in the history of the eleventh century. He composed commentaries on the Psalms and on the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, the former written probably during his professorship at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, the latter during his stay at the Grande Chartreuse if we may believe an old <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> seen by <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a>--"Explicit glosarius Brunonis heremitae super Epistolas B. Pauli." Two letters of his still remain, also his profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and a short elegy on contempt for the world which shows that he cultivated poetry. The "Commentaries" disclose to us a man of learning; he knows a little Hebrew and Greek and uses it to explain, or if need be, rectify the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>; he is familiar with the Fathers, especially <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, his favourites. "His style", says Dom Rivet, "is concise, clear, nervous and simple, and his Latin as good as could be expected of that century: it would be difficult to find a composition of this kind at once more solid and more luminous, more concise and more clear". His writings have been published several times: at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1509-24; Cologne, 1611-40; <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, Latin Patrology, CLII, CLIII, Montreuil-sur-Mer, 1891. The <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> edition of 1524 and those of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a> include also some sermons and <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> which may be more justly attributed to <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13683b.htm">Segni</a>. The Preface of the Blessed Virgin has also been wrongly ascribed to him; it is long anterior, though he may have contributed to introduce it into the liturgy.

<p>St. Bruno's distinction as the founder of an order was that he introduced into the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> the mixed form, or union of the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">eremitical</a> and cenobite modes of monasticism, a medium between the <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a> Rule and that of St. Benedict. He wrote no rule, but he left behind him two institutions which had little connection with each other--that of Dauphin&eacute; and that of Calabria. The foundation of Calabria, somewhat like the <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a>, comprised two classes of religious: <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a>, who had the direction of the order, and cenobites who did not feel called to the solitary life; it only lasted a century, did not rise to more than five houses, and finally, in 1191, united with the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian Order</a>. The foundation of <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, more like the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">rule of St. Benedict</a>, comprised only one kind of religious, subject to a uniform discipline, and the greater part of whose life was spent in solitude, without, however, the complete exclusion of the conventual life. This life spread throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, numbered 250 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and in spite of many trials continues to this day.

<p>The great figure of <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> has been often sketched by artists and has inspired more than one masterpiece: in <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, for example, the famous <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> by Houdon, at St. Mary of the Angels in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, "which would speak if his rule did not compel him to silence"; in <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, the fine picture by <a href="../cathen/15770a.htm">Zurbaran</a>, in the Seville museum, representing <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> and <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> in conference; the Apparition of the Blessed Virgin to <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a>, by Guercino at Bologna; and above all the twenty-two pictures forming the gallery of <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> in the museum of the Louvre, "a masterpiece of Le Sueur and of the French <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>".
