<h1>St. Bruno of Querfurt</h1>  

<p>(Also called BRUN and BONIFACE).

<p>Second Apostle of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussians</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, born about 970; died 14 February, 1009. He is generally represented with a hand cut off, and is commemorated on 15 October. Bruno was a member of the noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Querfurt and is commonly said to have been a relative of the Emperor <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a>, although Hefele (in Kirchenlex., II, s.v. Bruno) emphatically denies this. When hardly six years old he was sent to Archbishop Adalbert of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> to be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> and had the learned Geddo as his teacher in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. He was a well-behaved, industrious scholar, while still a lad he was made a canon of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The fifteen year-old <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> became attached to Bruno, made him one of his court, and took him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> when the young emperor went there in 996 to be <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a>. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> Bruno became acquainted with <a href="../cathen/01127c.htm">St. Adalbert</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, who was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> a year later by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussians</a> to whom he had gone as a missionary. After Adalbert's death Bruno was tied with an intense desire for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. He spent much of has time in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the Aventine where Adalbert had become a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, and where Abbot Johannes Canaparius wrote a life of Adalbert. Bruno, however, did not enter the monastic life here, but in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Pereum, an island in the swamps near <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>.

<p>Pereum was under the rule of the founder of the Camaldoli reform, <a href="../cathen/13179b.htm">St. Romuald</a>, a saint who had great influence over the Emperor <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a>. Under the guidance of St. Romuald Bruno underwent a severe ascetic training; it included manual work, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> all week except Sunday and Thursday, night vigils, and scourging on the bare back; in addition Bruno suffered greatly from fever. He found much pleasure in the friendship of a brother of the same age as himself, Benedict of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, who shared his cell and who was one with him in mind and spirit. The Emperor <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> desired to convert the lands; between the Elbe and the Oder, which were occupied by <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and to plant colonies there. He hoped to attain these ends through the aid of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to be founded in this region by some of the most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> of Romuald's pupils. In 1001, therefore, Benedict another brother of the same <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, Joannes, went, laden with gifts from the emperor, to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, where they were well received by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Duke Boleslas, who taught them the language of the people. During this time Bruno studied the language of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, where he remained with Otto and awaited the Apostolic appointment by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Sylvester II made him <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> over the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> and gave him the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, but left the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, who had the supervision of the mission to the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>. Quiting <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1003, Bruno was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in February, 1004, by Archbishop Tagino of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> and gave his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> for the founding of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. As <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> has broken out between Emperor Henry II and the Polish Duke, Bruno was not able to go at once to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>; so, starting from <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> on the Danube, he went into <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, where St. Alalbert had also laboured. Here he finished his life of <a href="../cathen/01127c.htm">St. Adalbert</a>, a literary memorial of much worth.

<p>Bruno sought to convert the Hungarian ruler Achtum and his principality of "Black-Hungary", but he met with so much opposition, including that of the Greek <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, that success was impossible. In December, 1007, he went to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Here the Grand duke Vladimir entertained him for a month and then gave him a territory extending to the possessions of the Petschenegen, who lived on the Black Sea between the Danube and the Don. This was considered the fiercest and most cruel of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> tribes. Bruno spent five months among them, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> some thirty adults, aided in bringing about a treaty of peace with <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and left in that country one of his companions whom he had <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. About the middle of the year 1008 he returned to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> and there <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for Sweden. While in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> he heard that his friend Benedict and four companions had been killed by robbers on 11 May, 1003. Making use of the accounts of eyewitnesses, he wrote the touching history of the lives and death of the so-called Polish brothers. Towards the end of 1008 he wrote a memorable, but ineffectual, letter to the Emperor Henry II, exhorting him to show clemency and to conclude a peace with Boleslas of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. Near the close of this same year, accompanied by eighteen companions, he went to found a mission among the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussians</a>, but the soil was not fruitful, and Bruno and his companions travelled towards the borders of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, preaching <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageously</a> as they went. On the borders of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> they were attacked by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, the whole company were <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a>, Bruno with great composure meeting death by decapitation. Duke Boleslas bought the bodies of the slain and had them brought to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. It is said that the city of Braunsberg is named after <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a>.

<p>Soon after the time of their death <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> and his companions were reverenced as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Little value is to be attached to a legendary account of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> by a certain Wipert. Bruno's fellow-pupil, <a href="../cathen/05047d.htm">Dithmar</a>, or Thietmar, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Merseburg, gives a brief account of him in his Chronicle. VI, 58.
