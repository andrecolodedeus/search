<h1>St. Caesarius of Nazianzus</h1>  

<p>Physician, younger and only brother of <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, born probably c. 330 at Arianzus, near Nazianzus; died at the end of 368 or the beginning of 369. He received a careful training from his saintly mother Nonna and his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> Gregory, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10728c.htm">Nazianzus</a>. He studied probably at Caesarea in Cappadocia, and then at the celebrated <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. Here his favourite studies were geometry, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, and especially medicine. In the last-named <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> he surpassed all his fellow students. About 355 he came to Constantinople, and had already acquired a great <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for his medical skill, when his brother <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory</a>, homeward bound from <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, appeared there about 358. Caesarius sacrificed a remunerative and honourable post and returned to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> with <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory</a>. The capital, however, soon proved to be too great an attraction for him; we find him occupying an exalted position as physician at the court of Constantine and, much to the regret of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, at that of <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a>. <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a> failed in his efforts to win him over to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Paganism</a>. Caesarius, more appreciative of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> than of imperial favour, ultimately left the court, but returned to Constantinople after <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian's</a> death. Under the <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Emperor Valens</a> he became quaestor of Bithynia. His remarkable escape from the earthquake which shook Nicaea (11 October, 368) induced him to heed the insistent appeals of his brother and <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, who urged him to leave the world. He was suddenly seized with a fatal illness, shortly after having received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which he, like many others at the period, had deferred until late in life. He as unmarried, and directed that all his goods should be distributed to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, an injunction which his servants abused in their own interests. His remains were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> at <a href="../cathen/10728c.htm">Nazianzus</a>, where his brother pronounced the funeral oration in the presence of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>.

<p>The admission of the identity of this Caesarius with his namesake, the Prefect of Constantinople, who, in 365, was thrown into the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> by Procopius, rests on an assumption of James Godefroy, the editor of the Theodosian Code (Lyons, 1665), and not on any solid historical ground. The four "Dialogues" of one hundred and ninety-seven questions and answers which go under his name, and are to be found in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G., XXXVIII, 851-1190, can hardly be from his pen, owing to their nature, contents, and anachronisms. Today they are generally looked upon as spurious.
