<h1>St. Cajetan</h1>  

<p>(GAETANO.)

<p>Founder of the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a>, born October, 1480 at <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a> in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> territory; died at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> in 1547. Under the care of a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> mother he passed a studious and exemplary youth, and took his degree as <em>doctor utriusque juris</em> at Padua in his twenty-fourth year. In 1506 he became at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a prothonotary Apostolic in the court of <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>, and took an important share in reconciling the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Republic of Venice</a> with that pontiff. On the death of Julius in 1523 he withdrew from the court, and is credited with founding, shortly after, an association of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> called the Oratory of Divine Love, which spread to other Italian towns. Though remarkable for his intense <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he did not advance to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> till 1516. Recalled to <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a> in the following year by the death of his mother, he founded there a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for incurables, thus giving <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the active charity that filled his whole life. But his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> was more deeply moved by the spiritual diseases that, in those days of political disorder, infected the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of all ranks, and, like <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> in earlier times, he strove to reform them by instituting a body of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, who should combine the spirit of monasticism with the exercises of the active ministry.

<p>Returning to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1523 he laid the foundations of his new congregation, which was canonically erected by <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> in 1524. One of his four companions was Giovanni Pietro Caraffa, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03659a.htm">Chieti</a> (in Latin <em>Theate</em>), afterwards <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>, who was elected first superior, and from whose title arose the name <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a>. The order grew but slowly. During the sack of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1527 the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a>, then twelve in number, escaped to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> after enduring many outrages from the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> invaders. There Cajetan met St. Hieronymus &AElig;miliani (see <a href="../cathen/14140a.htm">SOMASCHI</a>), whom he assisted in the establishment of his Congregation of <a href="../cathen/04051d.htm">Clerks Regular</a>. In 1533 Cajetan founded a house in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, where he was able to check the advances of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>. In 1540 he was again at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, whence he extended his work to <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> and <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>. He passed the last four years of his life, a sort of seraphic existence, at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> where he died finally of grief at the discords of the city, suffering in his last moments a kind of mystical crucifixion. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> in 1629, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a> in 1671. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on the 7th of August.
