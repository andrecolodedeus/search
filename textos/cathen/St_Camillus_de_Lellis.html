<h1>St. Camillus de Lellis</h1>  

<p>Born at Bucchianico, Abruzzo, 1550; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 14 July, 1614.

<p>He was the son of an officer who had served both in the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> and French armies. His mother died when he was a child, and he grew up absolutely neglected. When still a youth he became a soldier in the service of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and afterwards of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, until 1574, when his regiment was disbanded. While in the service he became a confirmed gambler, and in consequence of his losses at play was at times reduced to a condition of destitution. The kindness of a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friar</a> induced him to apply for admission to that order, but he was refused. He then betook himself to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he obtained employment in the Hospital for Incurables. He was prompted to go there chiefly by the hope of a cure of abscesses in both his feet from which he had been long suffering. He was dismissed from the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> on account of his quarrelsome disposition and his passion for gambling. He again became a <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> soldier, and took part in the campaign against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in 1569. After the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> he was employed by the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> at <a href="../cathen/09588a.htm">Manfredonia</a> on a new building which they were erecting. His old gambling habit still pursued him, until a discourse of the guardian of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> so startled him that he determined to reform. He was admitted to the order as a <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a>, but was soon dismissed on account of his infirmity. He betook himself again to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he entered the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> in which he had previously been, and after a temporary cure of his ailment became a nurse, and winning the admiration of the institution by his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, he was appointed director of the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>.

<p>While in this office, he attempted to found an order of lay infirmarians, but the scheme was opposed, and on the advice of his friends, among whom was his spiritual guide, <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a>, he determined to become a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He was then thirty-two years of age and began the study of Latin at the Jesuit College in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He afterwards established his order, the Fathers of a Good Death (1584), and bound the members by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to devote themselves to the plague-stricken; their work was not restricted to the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, but included the care of the sick in their homes. <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Pope Sixtus V</a> confirmed the congregation in 1586, and ordained that there should be an election of a general superior every three years. Camillus was naturally the first, and was succeeded by an Englishman, named Roger. Two years afterwards a house was established in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and there two of the community won the glory of being the first <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of charity of the congregation, by dying in the fleet which had been quarantined off the harbour, and which they had visited to nurse the sick. In 1591 <a href="../cathen/07004a.htm">Gregory XIV</a> erected the congregation into a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, with all the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicants</a>. It was again confirmed as such by <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, in 1592. The infirmity which had prevented his entrance among the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> continued to afflict Camillus for forty-six years, and his other ailments contributed to make his life one of uninterrupted suffering, but he would permit no one to wait on him, and when scarcely able to stand would crawl out of his bed to visit the sick. He resigned the generalship of the order, in 1607, in order to have more leisure for the sick and poor. Meantime he had established many houses in various cities of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He is said to have had the gift of <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">miracles</a> and <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. He died at the age of sixty-four while pronouncing a moving appeal to his religious brethren. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> near the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Mary Magdalen, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and, when the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which were attributed to him were officially approved, his body was placed under the altar itself. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> in 1742, and in 1746 was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>.

<p>[<em>Note:</em> In 1930, Pope Pius XI named St. Camillus de Lellis, together with <a href="../cathen/08472c.htm">St. John of God</a>, principal Co-Patron of nurses and of nurses' associations.]
