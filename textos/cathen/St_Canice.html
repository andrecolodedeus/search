<h1>St. Canice</h1>  

<p>(Or KENNY).

<p>Commemorated on 11 October, born in 515 or 516, at Glengiven, in what is now County Derry, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; died at Aghaboe in 600. He was descended from Ui-Dalainn, a Waterford tribe which dwelt on an island now identified as Inis-Doimhle in the Suir. The father of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was a distinguished bard who found his way to the North and settled at Glengiven in Cinachta under its chief. His mother was called Maul; her name is commemorated in the church of Thomplamaul, Kilkenny, dedicated to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> under her invocation. The early years of Canice were spent in watching his chieftain's flocks, but, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> calling him to higher aims, we find him in 543 at <a href="../cathen/04064a.htm">Clonard</a>, under St. Finian, where he was a fellow-pupil of St. Columba. In 544 he was studying in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Glasnevin, with St. Kieran of Clonmacnoise and <a href="../cathen/04152c.htm">St. Comgall</a> of Bangor, under the tuition of St. Mobhi. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 545 in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09315b.htm">Llancarvan</a> in Glamorganshire, and set out for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to obtain the blessing of the reigning pontiff. In 550 we find him again at Glengiven, where he converted his foster-brother, Geal-Breagach, who afterwards assisted him in founding Drumachose. In 565 he passed over to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, where his name is recalled in the ruins of an ancient church, Kil-Chainnech on Tiree Island, and in a burial ground, Kil-Chainnech, in <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a>. He built cells on the island of Ibdon and Eninis, an oratory called Lagan-Kenny on the shores of Lough Lagan, and a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in Fifeshire on the banks of the <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Eden</a>. He is known in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> as St. Kenneth, was closely associated with St. Columba in the latter's missionary work, and, next to him and St. Bridget, is the favourite <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> saint in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> (<em>Eammack</em>). See Reeve's "Adamn&agrave;n" (Dublin, 1857, xxvi, xxxi); also the ancient lives in the "Codex Solmanticensis" edited by De Smedt and <a href="../cathen/02190c.htm">Backer</a> (see below), and the "Liber Kilkenniensis" in Marsh's Library, Dublin. His <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> foundations were Drumachose, two miles southeast of Limavady, Kilkenny West, in County Westmeath, and the great Abbey of Aghaboe in <a href="../cathen/11342b.htm">Ossory</a>, Queens County. Tradition asserts that he founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in Kilkenny by the round tower and <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> which bears his name. A man of great eloquence and learning, he wrote a commentary on the Gospels, known for centuries as Glas-Chainnigh.
