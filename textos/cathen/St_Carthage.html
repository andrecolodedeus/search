<h1>St. Carthage</h1>  

<p>St. Carthage, whose name is also given as Mochuda, was born of a good <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, in what is now County Kerry, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, about the year 555. He spent his youth as a swineherd near Castlemaine, and became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in a neighbouring <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> under the guidance of St. Carthage the Elder, subsequently receiving <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> orders. In 580 he determined to lead a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit's</a> life, and he built a cell at Kiltallagh, where his fame soon attracted <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. After a few years the jealousy of two neighbouring <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> forced him to quit his hermitage, and he proceeded on a visit to Bangor, where he spent a year. On the advice of <a href="../cathen/04152c.htm">St. Comgall</a> he returned to Kerry and founded churches at Kilcarragh and Kilfeighney. He then visited Waterford, Clonfert-molua (Kyle), and Lynally, whence, on the recommendation of St. Colman Elo, he settled at Rahan, near Tullamore, in the present King's County.

<p>St. Carthage founded his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Rahan about 590, and soon had hundred of disciples. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Abbot-Bishop of the Fercal district, and composed a rule for his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> metrical poem of 580 lines, divided into nine separate sections &#151; one of the most interesting literary relics of the early <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church. Numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are also recorded to him. At length, Blathmaic, a Meathian prince, instigated by the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, ordered St. Carthage to leave Rahan. This expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> and eight hundred of his community took place at Eastertide of the year 635. Journeying by Saigher, Roscrea, <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a>, and Ardfinnan, St. Carthage at length came to the banks of the River Blackwater, where he was given a foundation by the Prince of the Decies, and thus sprang up the episcopal city of <em>Lios-mor</em>, or Lismore, County Waterford.

<p>Great as was the fame of Rahan, it was completely eclipsed by that of Lisemore, although St. Carthage lived less than two years at his new foundation. He spent the last eighteen months of his life in contemplation and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, in a cave near the present St. Carthage's Well. When at the point of death, he summoned his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and gave them his farewell exhortation and blessing. Fortified by the Body of Christ he died on the 14th of May, 637, on which day his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated as first Bishop and Patron of <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a>. Short as was St. Carthage's stay in <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a>, he left an ineffaceable impress of his labours in a famous <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and infant <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, but more so in the shining example of an austere and blameless life. Purity was his transcendent virtue, and to guard it he practised the severest penances. On this account St. Cuimin of <a href="../cathen/05147a.htm">Connor</a> thus writes of him in an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> quatrain: <blockquote> The beloved Mochuda of <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, <br>Admirable every page of his history. <br>Before his time there was no one who shed <br>Half so many tears as he shed. </blockquote>

<p>Usher had two <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> copies of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> life of St. Carthage; and in 1634 <a href="../cathen/11348a.htm">Philip O'Sullivan Beare</a> sent a Latin translation to Father John Bollandus, S.J. The "Vita Secunda" is the one usually quoted. In 1891 the present writer discovered the site of the <em>Relig Mochuda</em> in which St. Carthage was buried.
