<h1>St. Casimir</h1>  

<p>Prince of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, born in the royal palace at <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, 3 October, 1458; died at the court of Grodno, 4 March, 1484. He was the grandson of Wladislaus II Jagiello, King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, who introduced <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> into <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a>, and the second son of King Casimir IV and Queen Elizabeth, an Austrian princess, the daughter of Albert II, Emperor of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and King of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. Casimir's uncle, Wladislaus III, King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, perished at Varna in 1444, defending <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. Casimir's elder brother, Wladislaus, became King of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> in 1471, and King of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> in 1490. Of his four younger brothers, John I, Albert, Alexander, and Sigismund in turn occupied the Polish throne, while Frederick, the youngest, became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, and finally <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, in 1493. The early training of the young princes was entrusted to Father Dlugosz, the Polish historian, a canon at <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, and later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Lw&oacute;w (Lemberg), and to Filippo Buonaccorsi, called Callimachus. Father Dlugosz was a deeply religious man, a loyal patriot, and like Callimachus, well versed in statecraft. Casimir was placed in the care of this scholar at the age nine, and even then he was remarkable for his ardent <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. When Casimir was thirteen he was offered the throne of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> by a <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungarian</a> faction who were discontented under <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">King Matthias Corvinus</a>. Eager to defend the Cross against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, he accepted the call and went to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> to receive the crown. He was unsuccessful, however, and returned a fugitive to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. The young prince again became a pupil of Father Dlugosz, under whom he remained until 1475. He was later associated with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> who initiated him so well into public affairs that after his elder brother, Wladislaus, ascended to the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> throne, Casimir became heir-apparent to the throne of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. When in 1479 the king went to Lithuania to spend five years arranging affairs there, Casimir was placed in charge of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and from 1481 to 1483 administered the State with great <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. About this time his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> tried to arrange for him a marriage with the daughter of Frederick III, Emperor of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, but Casimir preferred to remain single. Shortly afterwards he fell victim to a severe attack of lung trouble, which, weak as he was from fastings and <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortifications</a>, he could not withstand. While on a journey to <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a>, he died at the court of Grodno, 4 March 1484. His remains were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>.

<p>St. Casimir was possessed of great charms of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and character, and was noted particularly for his <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and chastity. Often at night he would kneel for hours before the locked doors of churches, regardless of the hour or the inclemency of the weather. He had a special <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to the Blessed Virgin</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard of Clairvaux</a>, "Omni die dic Marix mea laudes anima", was long attributed to him. After his death he was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, because of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> wrought by him. Sigismund I, King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, petitioned the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for Casimir's <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Pope Leo X</a> appointed the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> Zaccaria Ferreri, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Guardalfiera, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Przemysl to investigate the life and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of Casimir. This inquiry was completed at Turn in 1520, and in 1522 Casimir was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/01159b.htm">Adrian VI</a>. <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Pope Clement VIII</a> named 4 March as his feast. St. Casimir is the patron of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> Lithuania, though he is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as far as Belgiumand <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. In <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> and Lithuania <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> are dedicated to him, as at Rozana and on the River Dzwina near Potocka, where he is said to have contributed <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> to a victory of the Polish army over the Russians. In the beginning of the seventeenth century King Sigismund III began at <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a> the erection of a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Casimir, which was finished under King Wladislaus IV. The building was designed by Peter Danckerts, of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, who also adorned the walls with <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> illustrating the life of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. In this <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> is found an old <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> renovated in 1594, representing the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> with a lily in his hand. Two other pictures of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> are preserved, one in his life by Ferreri, and the other in the church at Krosno in Galicia.
