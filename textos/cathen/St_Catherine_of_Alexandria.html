<h1>St. Catherine of Alexandria</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> whose <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> and in the various <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental churches</a> on 25 November, and who for almost six centuries was the object of a very popular <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a>.

<p>Of noble birth and learned in the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, when only eighteen years old, Catherine presented herself to the <a href="../cathen/10077b.htm">Emperor Maximinus</a> who was <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> persecuting the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, upbraided him for his cruelty and endeavoured to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> how iniquitous was the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">worship of false gods</a>. Astounded at the young girl's audacity, but incompetent to vie with her in point of learning the tyrant detained her in his palace and summoned numerous scholars whom he commanded to use all their skill in specious reasoning that thereby Catherine might be led to <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a>. But she emerged from the debate victorious. Several of her adversaries, conquered by her eloquence, declared themselves <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and were at once <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. Furious at being baffled, Maximinus had Catherine scourged and then <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>. Meanwhile the empress, eager to see so extraordinary a young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, went with Porphyry, the head of the troops, to visit her in her dungeon, when they in turn yielded to Catherine's exhortations, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and immediately won the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> crown. Soon afterwards the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, who far from forsaking her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, effected so many <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversions</a>, was condemned to die on the wheel, but, at her touch, this instrument of torture was <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> destroyed. The <a href="../cathen/10077b.htm">emperor</a>, enraged beyond control, then had her beheaded and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> carried her body to <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a> where later a church and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> were built in her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. So far the Acts of St. Catherine.

<p>Unfortunately we have not these acts in their original form, but transformed and distorted by fantastic and diffuse descriptions which are entirely due to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> of the narrators who cared less to state <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authentic</a> facts than to charm their readers by recitals of the marvellous. The importance attached throughout the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> to the legend of this <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> accounts for the eagerness and care with which in modern times the ancient Greek, Latin and Arabic texts containing it have been perused and studied, and concerning which critics have long since expressed their opinion, one which, in all likelihood, they will never have to retract. Several centuries ago when devotion to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> was stimulated by the reading of extraordinary <a href="../cathen/07106b.htm">hagiographical</a> narrations, the historical value of which no one was qualified to question, St. Catherine was invested by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> peoples with a halo of charming poetry and <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">miraculous power</a>.

<p>Ranked with <a href="../cathen/09652b.htm">St. Margaret</a> and <a href="../cathen/02284d.htm">St. Barbara</a> as one of the fourteen most helpful <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, she was unceasingly praised by preachers and sung by poets. It is a well-known fact that <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to her one of his most beautiful panegyrics and that <a href="../cathen/01134b.htm">Adam of Saint-Victor</a> wrote a magnificent poem in her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>: "Vox Sonora nostri chori", etc. In many places her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> was celebrated with the utmost <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>, servile work being suppressed and the <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotions</a> being attended by great numbers of people. In several <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> it was observed as a Holy Day of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> up to the beginning of the seventeenth century, the splendour of its ceremonial eclipsing that of the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feasts</a> of some of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Numberless <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> were placed under her patronage and her <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> was found in nearly all churches, representing her according to <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/07625a.htm">iconography</a> with a wheel, her instrument of torture. Whilst, owing to several circumstances in his life, <a href="../cathen/11063b.htm">St. Nicholas of Myra</a>, was considered the <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron</a> of young bachelors and students, St. Catherine became the patroness of young maidens and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> students. Looked upon as the holiest and most illustrious of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it was but natural that she, of all others, should be worthy to watch over the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> and the young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of the world.

<p>The spiked wheel having become emblematic of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, wheelwrights and mechanics placed themselves under her patronage. Finally, as according to tradition, she not only remained a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> by governing her <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and conquered her executioners by wearying their patience, but triumphed in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">science</a> by closing the mouths of <a href="../cathen/14145c.htm">sophists</a>, her <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a> was implored by <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologists</a>, pulpit orators, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. Before studying, writing, or preaching, they besought her to illumine their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a>, guide their pens, and impart eloquence to their words. This devotion to St. Catherine which assumed such vast proportions in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> after the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>, received additional eclat in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in the beginning of the fifteenth century, when it was rumoured that she had appeared to <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a> and, together with <a href="../cathen/09652b.htm">St. Margaret</a>, had been divinely appointed <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan's</a> adviser.

<p>Although contemporary <a href="../cathen/07106b.htm">hagiographers</a> look upon the <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authenticity</a> of the various texts containing the legend of St. Catherine as more than <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, it is not therefore meant to cast even the shadow of a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> around the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. But the conclusion reached when these texts have been carefully studied is that, if the principal facts forming the outline are to be accepted as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the multitude of details by which these facts are almost obscured, most of the wonderful narratives with which they are embellished, and the long discourses that are put into the mouth of St. Catherine, are to be rejected as inventions, pure and simple.

<p>An example will illustrate. Although all these texts mention the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> translations of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> body to <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08254a.htm">itineraries</a> of the ancient <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> who visited <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Sinai</a> do not contain the slightest allusion to it. Even in the eighteenth century Dom Deforis, the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> who prepared an edition of <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet's</a> works, declared the tradition followed by this orator in his panegyric on the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, to be in a great measure <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, and it was just at this <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of St. Catherine disappeared from the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Since then devotion to the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> has lost all its former popularity.
