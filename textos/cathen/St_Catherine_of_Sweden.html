<h1>St. Catherine of Sweden</h1>  

<p>The fourth child of <a href="../cathen/02782a.htm">St. Bridget</a> and her husband, Ulf Gudmarsson, born 1331 or 1332; died 24 March, 1381. At the time of her death St. Catherine was head of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Wadstena, founded by her mother; hence the name, Catherine Vastanensis, by which she is occasionally called. At the age of seven she was sent to the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Riseberg to be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> and soon showed, like her mother, a desire for a life of <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">self-mortification</a> and devotion to spiritual things. At the command of her father, when about thirteen or fourteen years, she married a noble of German descent, Eggart von K&uuml;rnen. She at once persuaded her husband, who was a very religious man, to join her in a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of chastity. Both lived in a state of virginity and devoted themselves to the exercise of <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a> and active charity. In spite of her deep <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for her husband, Catherine accompanied her mother to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where St. Bridget went in 1349. Soon after her arrival in that city Catherine received news of the death of her husband in <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>. She now lived constantly with her mother, took an active part in St. Bridget's fruitful labours, and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> imitated her mother's ascetic life. Although the distinguished and beautiful young <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> was surrounded by suitors, she steadily refused all offers of marriage. In 1372 St. Catherine and her brother, Birger, accompanied their mother on a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the Holy Land; after their return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> St. Catherine was with her mother in the latter's last illness and death.

<p>In 1374, in obedience to St. Bridget's wish, Catherine brought back her mother's body to Sweden for burial at Wadstena, of which foundation she now became the head. It was the motherhouse of the <a href="../cathen/02785a.htm">Brigittine</a> Order, also called the Order of St. Saviour. Catherine managed the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> with great skill and made the life there one in harmony with the principles laid down by its founder. The following hear she went again to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in order to promote the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of St. Bridget, and to obtain a new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation of the order. She secured another confirmation both from <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> (1377) and from <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a> (1379) but was unable to gain at the time the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of her mother, as the confusion caused by the Schism delayed the process. When this sorrowful division appeared she showed herself, like <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a>, a steadfast adherent of the part of the Roman Pope, <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>, in whose favour she testified before a judicial commission. Catherine stayed five years in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and then returned home, bearing a special letter of commendation from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Not long after her arrival in Sweden she was taken ill and died. In 1484 <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a> gave permission for her veneration as a saint and her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> was assigned to 22 March in the Roman <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a>. Catherine wrote a devotional work entitled "Consolation of the Soul" (Sielinna Tro&euml;st), largely composed of citations from the Scriptures and from early religious books; no copy is known to exist. Generally she is represented with a hind at her side, which is said to have come to her aid when unchaste youths sought to ensnare her.
