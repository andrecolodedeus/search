<h1>St. Ceadda</h1>  

<p>(Commonly known as ST. CHAD.)

<p><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Lastingham, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> successively of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a> and <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a>, <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">England</a>; <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth uncertain, died 672.

<p>He is often confounded with his brother, <a href="../cathen/03475a.htm">St. Cedd</a>, also <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Lastingham and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the East Saxons. He had two other brothers, Cynibill and Caelin, who also became <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Probably Northumbrian by birth, he was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a> under <a href="../cathen/01233d.htm">St. Aidan</a>, but afterwards went to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, where he studied with <a href="../cathen/05325a.htm">St. Ecgberht</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Rathmelsige (<a href="../cathen/10168a.htm">Melfont</a>). There he returned to help his brother <a href="../cathen/03475a.htm">St. Cedd</a> to establish the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Laestingaeu, now Lastingham in Yorkshire. On his brother's death in 664, he succeeded him as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>.

<p>Shortly afterwards <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a>, who had been chosen to succeed Tudi, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a>, went to Gaul for <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> and remained so long absent that King Oswiu determined to wait no longer, and procured the <a href="../cathen/05374b.htm">election</a> of Chad as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, to which place the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a> had been transferred. As <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> was vacant, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Wini of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, assisted by two British <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. As <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> he visited his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> on foot, and laboured in an apostolic spirit until the arrival of <a href="../cathen/14571a.htm">St. Theodore</a>, the newly elected <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> who was making a <a href="../cathen/15479a.htm">general visitation</a>. <a href="../cathen/14571a.htm">St. Theodore</a> decided that St. Chad must give up the diocese to <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a>, who had now returned. When he further intimated that St. Chad's episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> had not been rightly performed, the Saint replied, "If you decide that I have not rightly received the episcopal character, I willingly lay down the office; for I have never thought myself worthy of it, but under obedience, I, though unworthy, consented to undertake it". <a href="../cathen/14571a.htm">St. Theodore</a>, however, desired him not to relinquish the episcopate and himself supplied what was lacking ("ipse ordinationem ejus denuo catholica ratione consummavit" &#151; <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, Hist. Eccl. IV, 2). Ceadda then returned to Lastingham, where he remained till <a href="../cathen/14571a.htm">St. Theodore</a> called him in 669 to become <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the Mercians. He built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a>, where he dwelt with seven or eight <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, devoting to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and study time he could spare from his work as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He received warning of his death in a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a>.

<p>His <a href="../cathen/13760a.htm">shrine</a>, which was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, was removed in the twelfth century to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a>, dedicated to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> and the Saint himself. At the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were rescued from profanation by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and they now lie in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>, which is dedicated to him. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">festival</a> is kept on the 2nd of March. All accounts of his life are based on that given by <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a>, who had been instructed in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a> by Trumberct, one of St. Chad's <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and disciples.
