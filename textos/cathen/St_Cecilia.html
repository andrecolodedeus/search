<h1>St. Cecilia</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">Virgin</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patroness</a> of <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a>, died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>This saint, so often glorified in the <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a> and in poetry, is one of the most <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity. The oldest historical account of St. Cecilia is found in the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum"; from this it is evident that her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> was celebrated in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> in the fourth century. Her name occurs under different dates in the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a>; its mention under 11 August, the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Tiburtius, is evidently a later and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> addition, due to the fact that this Tiburtius, who was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> on the Via Labicana, was wrongly identified with Tiburtius, the brother-in-law of St. Cecilia, mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts</a> of her <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Perhaps also there was another Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of the name of Cecilia <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> on the Via Labicana. Under the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of 16 September Cecilia is mentioned alone, with the topographical note: "Appi&acirc; vi&acirc; in e&acirc;dem urbe Rom&acirc; natale et passio sanct&aelig; Cecili&aelig; virginis (the text is to be thus corrected). This is evidently the day of the <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">burial</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/03183d.htm">Callistus</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> mentioned under 22 November, on which day it is still celebrated, was kept in the church in the Trastevere quarter at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to her. Its origin, therefore, is to be traced most probably to this church. The early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> guides (<em>Itineraria</em>) to the burial-places of Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> point out her grave on the Via Appia, next to the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of the Roman <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the third century (<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, Roma sotterranea, I, 180-181). <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> located the burial-place of Cecilia in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Callistus in a <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> immediately adjoining the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>; an empty <a href="../cathen/11053b.htm">niche</a> in one of the walls contained, probably, at one time the sarcophagus with the bones of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. Among the frescoes of a later time with which the wall of the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a> are adorned, the figure of a richly-dressed <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> appears twice and <a href="../cathen/15209a.htm">Pope Urban</a>, who was brought personal into close relation with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> by the <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts</a> of her <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, is depicted once. The ancient titular church of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, mentioned above was built as early as the fourth century and is still preserved in the Trastevere. This church was certainly dedicated in the fifth century to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> on the Via Appia; it is mentioned in the signatures of the Roman Council of 499 as "titulus sanctae Caeciliae" (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, Coll, Conc. VIII, 236). Like some other ancient <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> churches of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which are the gifts of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> whose names they bear, it may be inferred that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> owes this temple to the generosity of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> herself; in support of this view it is to be noted that the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, under which the oldest part of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Callistus is constructed, belonged most likely, according to <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi's</a> researches, to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of St. Cecilia (Gens Caecilia), and by <a href="../cathen/05117a.htm">donation</a> passed into the possession of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. Although her name is not mentioned in the earliest (fourth century) list of <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feasts</a> (Depositio martyrum), the fact that in the "Sacramentarium Leoniam", a collection of masses completed about the end of the fifth century, are found no less than five different masses in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Cecilia testifies to the great veneration in which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was at that time held in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> ["Sacram. Leon.", ed. <a href="../cathen/10641b.htm">Muratori</a>, in "Opera" (Arezzo, 1771), XIII, I, 737, sqq.].

<p>About the middle of the fifth century originated <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of St. Cecilia which have been transmitted in numerous <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>; these acts were also translated into Greek. They were utilized in the prefaces of the above-mentioned masses of the "Sacramentarium Leonianum". They inform us, that Cecilia, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> of a senatorial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> from her infancy, was given in marriage by her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to a noble <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> youth Valerianus. When, after the celebration of the marriage, the couple had retired to the wedding-chamber, Cecilia told Valerianus that she was <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who jealously guarded her body; therefore Valerianus must take care not to violate her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. Valerianus wished to see the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, whereupon Cecilia sent him to the third milestone on the Via Appia where he should meet <a href="../cathen/15209a.htm">Bishop (Pope) Urbanus</a>. Valerianus <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>, was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15209a.htm">pope</a>, and returned a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> to Cecilia. An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> then appeared to the two and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> them with roses and lilies. When Tiburtius, the brother of Valerianus, came to them, he too was won over to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. As <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> children of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> both brothers distributed rich <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04215a.htm">confessors</a> who had died for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The prefect, Turcius Almachius, condemned them to death; an officer of the prefect, Maximus, appointed to execute this sentence, was himself <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> and suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> with the two brothers. Their remains were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in one <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> by Cecilia. And now Cecilia herself was sought by the officers of the prefect. Before she was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, she arranged that her house should be preserved as a place of worship for the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. After a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, she was condemned to be suffocated in the bath of her own house. But as she remained unhurt in the overheated room, the prefect had her decapitated in that place. The executioner let his sword fall three times without separating the head from the trunk, and fled, leaving the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> bathed in her own blood. She lived three days, made dispositions in favour of the <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poor</a>, and provided that after her death her house should be dedicated as a church. <a href="../cathen/15209a.htm">Urbanus</a> <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> her among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the confessors, i.e. in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Callistus.



<p>In this shape the whole story has no historical value; it is a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> romance, like so many others compiled in the fifth and sixth century. The existence of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, however, is a historical fact. The relation between St. Cecilia and Valerianus, Tiburtius, and Maximus, mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts</a>, has perhaps some historical foundation. These three <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Praetextatus on the Via Appia, where their <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> are mentioned in the ancient pilgrim <em>Itineraria.</em> In the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum" their <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is set down under 14 April with the note: "Romae via Appia in cimiterio Pr&aelig;textati"; and the <a href="../cathen/11204a.htm">octave</a> under 21 April, with the comment: "Rome in cimiterio Calesti via Appia". In the opinion of Duchesne the octave was celebrated in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Callistus, because St. Cecilia was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> there. If, therefore, this second notice in the <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> is older than the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts</a>, and the latter did not give rise to this second <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a>, it follows that before the <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts</a> were written this group of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was brought into relation with St. Cecilia. The time when Cecilia suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is not known. From the mention of <em>Urbanus</em> nothing can be concluded as to the time of composition of the <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts</a>; the author without any authority, simply introduced the confessor of this name (<a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Praetextatus) on account of the nearness of his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> to those of the other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and identified him with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of the same name. The author of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> used the <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts</a> for his notice of <a href="../cathen/15209a.htm">Urbanus</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts</a> offer no other indication of the time of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. <a href="../cathen/06149a.htm">Venantius Fortunatus</a> (Miscellanea, 1, 20; 8,6) and Ado (Martyrology, 22 November) place the death of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> in the reign of <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a> and <a href="../cathen/04166a.htm">Commodus</a> (about 177), and <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> tried to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> this view as historically the surest one. In other Western sources of the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> and in the Greek "Synaxaria" this <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is placed in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>. P.A. Kirsch tried to locate it in the time of <a href="../cathen/13743a.htm">Alexander Severus</a> (229-230); Aub&eacute;, in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a> (249-250); <a href="../cathen/08614a.htm">Kellner</a>, in that of <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a> (362). None of these opinion is sufficiently established, as neither the <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts</a> nor the other sources offer the requisite chronological evidence. The only sure <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> indication is the position of the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Callistus, in the immediate proximity of the very ancient <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/15209a.htm">Urbanus</a> probably, and surely Pontianus and <a href="../cathen/01553a.htm">Anterus</a> were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a>. The earliest part of this <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> dates at all events from the end of the second century; from that time, therefore, to the middle of the third century is the period left open for the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of St. Cecilia.

<p>Her church in the Trastevere quarter of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was rebuilt by <a href="../cathen/11514a.htm">Paschal I</a> (817-824), on which occasion the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> wished to transfer thither her <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>; at first, however, he could not find them and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that they had been <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">stolen</a> by the <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombards</a>. In a vision he saw St. Cecilia, who exhorted him to continue his search, as he had already been very near to her, i.e. near her <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">grave</a>. He therefore renewed his quest; and soon the body of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, draped in costly stuffs of gold brocade and with the cloths soaked in her blood at her feet, was actually found in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Pr&aelig;textatus. They may have been transported thither from the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Callistus to save them from earlier depredations of the Lombards in the vicinity of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Cecilia with those of Valerianus, Tiburtius, and Maximus, also those of Popes <a href="../cathen/15209a.htm">Urbanus</a> and <a href="../cathen/09411a.htm">Lucius</a>, were taken up by <a href="../cathen/11514a.htm">Pope Paschal</a>, and reburied under the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of St. Cecilia in Trastevere. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> founded in the neighbourhood by the same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> were charged with the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of singing the daily Office in this <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a>. From this time the veneration of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> continued to spread, and numerous churches were dedicated to her. During the restoration of the church in the year 1599 Cardinal Sfondrato had the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> examined and found under it the sarcophagi, with the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, that <a href="../cathen/11514a.htm">Pope Paschal</a> had transported thither. Recent excavations beneath the church, executed at the instigation and expense of Cardinal Rampolla, disclosed remains of Roman buildings, which have remained accessible. A richly adorned underground <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was built beneath the middle <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisle</a>, and in it a latticed <a href="../cathen/15653b.htm">window</a>, opening over the altar, allows a view of the receptacles in which the bones of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> repose. In a side <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the church there have long been shown the remains of the bath in which, according to the <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts</a>, Cecilia was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>.

<p>The oldest representations of St. Cecilia show her in the attitude usual for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> of the earlier centuries, either with the crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in her hand (e.g. at S. Apollinare Nuovo in <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, in a sixth-century <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a>) or in the attitude of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, as an <em>Orans</em> (e.g. the two sixth and seventh-century pictures in her <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a>). In the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> of her church in Trastevere is still preserved the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> made under <a href="../cathen/11514a.htm">Pope Paschal</a>, wherein she is represented in rich garments as patroness of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Medieval</a> pictures of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> are very frequent; since the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries she is given the <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a> as an attribute, or is represented as playing on the <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a>, evidently to express what was often attributed to her in panegyrics and poems based on the <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts</a>, viz., that while the musicians played at her nuptials she sang in her heart to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only ("cantantibus organis illa in corde suo soi domino decantabat"); possibly the <em>cantantibus organis</em> was <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> interpreted of Cecilia herself as the <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organist</a>. In this way the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was brought into closer relation with music. When the Academy of Music was founded at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1584) she was made patroness of the institute, whereupon her veneration as patroness of <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a> in general became still more universal; today Cecilian <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> (musical associations) exist everywhere. The <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a> is now her ordinary attribute; with it Cecilia was represented by <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> in a famous picture preserved at Bologna. In another magnificent masterpiece, the marble statute beneath the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of the above-mentioned church of St. Cecilia at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/09512b.htm">Carlo Maderna</a> represented her lying prostrate, just as she had received the death-blow from the executioner's hand. Her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated in the Latin and the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> on 22 November. In the "Martyrologium Hieronymainum" are commemorated other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of this name, but of none of them is there any exact historical information. One suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in Carthage with Dativus in 304.
