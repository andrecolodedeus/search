<h1>St. Ceolfrid</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/15572a.htm">Wearmouth</a> and Jarrow, b. 642, place of birth not known; d. 29 Sept., 716, at <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a> on the frontier of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> belonged to the highest rank of the Ango-Saxon nobility. The name Ceolfrid is the Teutonic form of Geoffrey. At the age of eighteen he became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Ripon, then ruled over by <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a>. After ten years of study and preparation he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a>. He soon afterwards visited Canterbury and spent some time with Botulph, founder and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Icanhoe, now the town of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> (Botulph's town) in Lincolnshire. On his return to Ripon he fulfilled the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of novice-master, in which capacity he became noted for his profound <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of menial work. His fame reached the ears of <a href="../cathen/02441b.htm">St. Benedict Biscop</a>, then in the midst of his great monastic enterprise on the banks of the Wear. He begged him from <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a>, and soon after reaching <a href="../cathen/15572a.htm">Wearmouth</a> Ceolfrid was made <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and left in charge during the absence of Benedict on his journeys to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Meeting with difficulties as superior, he went back to Ripon, but was afterwards persuaded to return. From this time he became the constant companion of Benedict and accompanied him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on his fifth journey to the Holy City.

<p>About 681 Benedict began the foundation of a second <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Jarrow on the banks of the Tyne about six miles from <a href="../cathen/15572a.htm">Wearmouth</a>. Ceolfrid was appointed the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> to act as the deputy of Benedict, who in reality was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of both houses. He took with him seventeen <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from <a href="../cathen/15572a.htm">Wearmouth</a>, and from an inscription formerly on the wall of the church we learn that the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was completed about 684 or 685. Benedict died 12 January, 690, and directed the brethren to elect Ceolfrid to be his successor. Ceolfrid proved himself a worthy disciple of his master, carefully carrying out the ideals of Benedict. His disciple, the <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a>, has thus described his character and work: "This last [Ceolfrid] was himself a man of most extraordinary diligence and superior quickness of apprehension; prompt in carrying into effect but prudent in forming designs and unrivalled in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. . . During his long administration Ceolfrid brought to a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> conclusion all the admirable plans for promoting <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> which his distinguished predecessor had begun. Time also suggested and enabled him to carry into execution numerous improvements of his own. Amongst a great variety of these, we ought particularly to notice that he considerably augmented the number of private <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of ease; added largely to the plate and <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">sacred vestments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and with ardour which equalled the past energy of Benedict in founding, he nearly doubled the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of both his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Besides innumerable other literary acquisitions he procured three <a href="../cathen/11439a.htm">pandects</a> of the new, added to one of the old translations of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> which he had brought from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In his latter days, departing again for that city, he took with him as a donative one of these three valued volumes, leaving to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> the other two" (Liber de Vitis Abbat. Wirim, Wilcock tr.).

<p>This volume, which Ceolfrid carried with him on his last journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was the famous "Codex Amiatinus". Until recent years it was thought to have been the work of Servandus, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> near Alatri in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (sixth century). The name of <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> has also been connected with this <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, owing to its striking resemblance to his Bible; but Vigouroux concludes that it is absolutely independent of <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a>, though the prologue it contains on the divisions of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> may possibly be of Cassiodorian origin. The famous <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> antiquarian, <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> (1888), discovered its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> origin. He has conclusively <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that it was written at <a href="../cathen/15572a.htm">Wearmouth</a> or Jarrow between the years 690 and 716; that it was one of the three copies of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> which <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> refers to in the passage quoted above; and that Ceolfrid presented the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. For many years it was preserved in the Abbey of Monte Amiato near <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>; it now rests in the Laurentenian Library at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, where it was transferred at the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in 1786. This Codex gives the oldest text of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> and has played a most important role in its history; in the publication of the Sixtine and Clementine editions of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> it was preferred to all other <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. Samuel Berger says of it: "It is from Northumberland that the correct texts of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> were sent out not only throughout <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was thus paying a <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>, but also throughout <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> was from York and had been chosen by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> to correct the text of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>." He was instrumental in extinguishing the last remnants of Celtic particularism in the celebration of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>.

<p>Ceolfrid obtained from <a href="../cathen/13728b.htm">Pope Sergius I</a> letters of immunity for his two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and had them presented before a synod of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the presence of King Alefrid, thus obtaining both royal and episcopal sanction. With the advance of years came sickness and infirmity, and he resigned his office with the intention of journeying to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, there to end his days. He also wished to give his brethren an opportunity of "living under the direction of a younger <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, that the example of a more active leader might inspire them with greater ardour in the pursuit of virtue". He died on his last journey at <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>, and was buried in the church of the three <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, Sts. Speusippus, Eleusippus, and Meleusippus. His <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were afterwards transferred to Jarrow, and thence, in the time of the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> invasions, to Glastonbury.
