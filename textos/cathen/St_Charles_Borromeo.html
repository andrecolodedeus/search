<h1>St. Charles Borromeo</h1>  

<p>St. Charles Borromeo &#151; <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of the Title of St. Prassede, Papal Secretary of State under <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, and one of the chief factors in the <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Catholic Counter-Reformation</a> &#151; was born in the Castle of Arona, a town on the southern shore of the Lago Maggiore in northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 2 October, 1538; died at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 3 November, 1584. His emblem is the word <em>humilitas</em> <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a>, which is a portion of the Borromeo shield. He is usually represented in <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a> in his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> robes, barefoot, carrying the <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a> as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>; a rope round his neck, one hand raised in <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, thus recalling his work during the plague. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 4 November.

<p>His father was Count Giberto Borromeo, who, about 1530, married Margherita de Medici. Her younger brother was Giovanni Angelo, Cardinal de' Medici, who became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1559 under the title of <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>. Charles was the second son, and the third of six children, of Giberto and Margherita. Charles' mother died about the year 1547, and his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">married again</a>.

<p>His early years were passed partly in the Castle of Arona, and partly in the Palazzo Borromeo at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. At the age of twelve his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> allowed him to receive the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>, and, upon the resignation of his uncle, Julius Caesar Borromeo, he became titular <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Sts. Gratinian and Felinus at Arona.

<p>When he received the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> he was sent by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, where he studied <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> under J.J. Merla. In October, 1552, he left Arona for the <a href="../cathen/11593a.htm">University of Pavia</a>, where he had as his tutor Francesco Alciato, afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. His correspondence shows that he was allowed a small sum by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, and that often he was in straitened circumstances, which caused him considerable inconvenience. It was not only that he himself suffered, but that his retinue also were not suitably clothed. Charles evidently felt bitterly his humiliation, but he does not seem to have shown impatience. Leaving <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a> to meet his uncle, Cardinal de' Medici, at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, he was, within a few weeks called upon to attend the funeral of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, who died early in August, 1558, and was buried in the church of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> delle Grazie, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>.

<p>Fresh responsibilities at once came to Charles, for though he was not the elder son, yet, at the request of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, including even his brother, he assumed charge of all the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> business. The question of possession of the Castle of Arona was one of great difficulty, as it was claimed by both <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Charles conducted the negotiations with great energy and diplomatic skill, and as a consequence of the Peace of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> (3 April, 1559) the castle was handed over to Count Francesco Borromeo, in the name of his nephew, Federigo Borromeo, to be held by him for the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. He also did much to restore to their ancient monastic discipline the religious of his Abbey of Sts. Gratinian and Felinus. Though his studies were so often interrupted, yet his seriousness and attention enabled him to complete them with success, and in 1559 he maintained his thesis for the doctorate of civil and canon law.

<p>In the summer of 1559, <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> died, and the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> for the election of his successor, which began on 9 September, was not concluded till December, when Cardinal Giovanni Angelo de' Medici was elected and took the name of <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>. On the 3rd of January, 1560, Charles received a message by a courier from the <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">pope</a>, asking him to proceed at once to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He started immediately for the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>, but though he travelled rapidly he was not in time for the <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> (6 January). On 22 January he wrote to Count Guido Borromeo that the <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">pope</a> had given him the charge of the administration of all the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">papal states</a>. On 31 January he was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">cardinal-deacon</a>, together with Giovanni de' Medici, son of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, and Gianantonio Serbellone, cousin of the <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">pope</a>. Charles was given the title of Sts. Vitus and Modestus, which was in the August following changed to that of St. Martino-ai-Monti. He wished for no rejoicings at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>; all the celebration was to be at Arona, where were to be said ten Masses <em>de Spiritu Sancto</em>. At this time Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, resigned the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishopric</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and on 8 February the <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">pope</a> named Charles as administrator of the vacant see. In succession he was named Legate of Bologna, Romagna, and the <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a>. He was named Protector of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, of Lower <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cantons of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. Under his protection were placed the orders of St. Francis, the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07543a.htm">Humiliati</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> of the Holy Cross of Coimbra, the <a href="../cathen/07477a.htm">Knights of Jerusalem (or Malta)</a>, and those of the Holy Cross of Christ in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. By a <em>motu proprio</em> (22 January, 1561) <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> gave him an annual income of 1000 golden crowns from the <a href="../cathen/10194a.htm">episcopal <em>mensa</em></a> of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>.

<p>Charles' office of secretary of state and his care for the business of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> did not prevent him from giving time to study, and even to recreations in the form of playing the lute and violoncello, and a game of ball. He lived at first at the Vatican, but in July, 1562, removed to the Palazzo Colonna, Piazza Sancti Apostoli. Soon after his arrival in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he founded at the Vatican an academy, which was a way of providing, by literary work, a distraction from more serious occupations. The members, whether <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, met nearly every evening, and many of their contributions are amongst the works of Charles as "Noctes Vaticanae". Charles was very soon occupied as secretary of state in using his influence to bring about the re-assembling of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, which had been suspended since 1552. The state of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> was appalling from an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> point of view. Many were the difficulties that had to be overcome &#151; with the emperor, with <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II of Spain</a>, and, greatest of all, with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where the demand was made for a national council. Still, in spite of obstacles, the work went on with the view of re-assembling the council, and for the most part it was Charles' patience and devotion that accomplished the object.



<p>It was not until 18 January, 1562, that the council resumed at <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>, with two <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, 106 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 4 mitred <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and 4 generals of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders present. The correspondence which passed between Charles and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> at <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> is enormous, and the questions which arose many times threatened to bring about the breaking-up of the council. Difficulties with the emperor, the national principles put forward on behalf of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by the Cardinal Charles of Lorraine, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, required from Charles constant attention and the greatest delicacy and skill in treatment. The twenty-fifth, and last, session of the council was held 3 and 4 December, 1563; at it were present 255 Fathers. At a consistory on the 26th of January, 1564, <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> confirmed the decrees of the council, and later appointed a congregation of eight <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to see to the execution of these decrees. During the sitting of the re-assembled council Charles' elder brother, Count Federigo, had died (28 November, 1562). This event had a very determining result as to Charles, for he immediately resolved to give himself with greater strictness to spiritual matters, and he looked upon his brother's death as a warning to him to give up all worldly things. His resolution was well needed, for, as he was now head of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, great pressure was brought to bear upon him to give up the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a> and to marry. This view was even suggested to him by the <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">pope</a> at the instance of other relatives. Some months passed in these efforts to influence Charles, but finally he resolved to definitely fix himself in the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a> by being secretly <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> took place, by the hands of Cardinal Federigo Cesa, in Santa Maria Maggiore, on the 4th of September, 1563. He writes that he celebrated his first Mass on the Assumption, in St. Peter's, at the altar of the Confession. He said his second Mass at his house, attached to the Gesu, in an oratory where St. Ignatius had been accustomed to celebrate. Charles at this time had as his confessor Father Giovanni Battista Ribera, S.J. On the 7th of December, 1563, the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the Sistine Chapel; on the 23rd of March, 1564, he received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/12376a.htm">preconized</a> on the 12th of May. In the following June his title was changed to that of Santa Prassede.

<p>Meanwhile Charles had provided for the spiritual wants of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Antonio Roberti, in May, 1560, has, as his vicar, taken possession of his <a href="../cathen/01694d.htm">archbishopric</a>, and Charles sent Monsignor Donato, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a>, as his deputy for episcopal functions. Monsignor Donato soon died, and in his place, Charles commissioned Monsignor Girolamo Ferragato, O.S.A., one of his suffragans, to visit the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and to report on its needs. Ferragato entered <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 23 April, 1562; on 24 June of the same year Charles sent to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> Fathers Palmio and Carvagial, S.J., with the object of preparing the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, both <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, for the carrying out of the reforms prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. While anxious for the spiritual welfare of his flock, he was no less solicitous for his own. There came to him the thought of what was the will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> concerning him, and whether he was to continue as the spiritual father of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> or retire to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. It happened in the autumn of 1563, between the sessions of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Lorraine went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, accompanied by <a href="../cathen/02314b.htm">Ven. Bartholomew of the Martyrs, O.P.</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a>, in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. Bartholomew had already shown himself to be of a like spirit to Charles, and when <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> introduced them, and suggested that he should begin the reform of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Charles, Bartholomew answered that if the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">princes of the Church</a> had all been like Cardinal Borromeo, he would have proposed them as models for the reform of the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In a private interview, Charles opened his heart to Bartholomew and told him of his thought of retiring to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Bartholomew applauded his desire, but at the same time declared his opinion that it was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will that he should not abandon his position. Charles was now assured that it was his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to remain in the world; but all the more he felt he ought to visit his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, though the <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">pope</a> always opposed his departure. Bartholomew counselled patience, and represented the assistance he could give to the <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">pope</a> and the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by remaining in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Charles was satisfied, and stayed on, doing the great work <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> by sending <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> deputies. After the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> he was much occupied with the production of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> embodying the teaching of the council, the revision of the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> and <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>. He also was a member of a commission for the reform of <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a>, and chose <a href="../cathen/11421b.htm">Palestrina</a> to compose three masses; one of these is the "Missa Papae Marcelli".

<p>Pastoral solicitude, which is the characteristic chosen for mention in the collect of his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a>, made him ever anxious to have the most suitable representatives in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. He heard of the excellent qualities of Monsignor Nicol&ograve; Ormaneto, of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, and succeeded in obtaining the consent of his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to his transference to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. Ormaneto had been in the household of <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a>, and also the principal assistant of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>. On the 1st of July, 1564, Ormaneto reached <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and at once carried out Charles' instructions by calling together a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod for the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. There were 1200 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at the Synod. It was with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> that Charles began the reform, and the many abuses needed skilful and tactful treatment. Father Palmio contributed much in bringing the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to a sense of the necessity for reform. The synod was followed by a visitation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> by Ormaneto. In September Charles sent thirty <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> to assist his vicar; three of these were placed over the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, which was opened on the 11th of November (<a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>). Charles was constantly directing the work of restoration of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the young, even down to minute details, was foremost in his thoughts. The manner of preaching, repression of <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avaricious</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ceremonies, and <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a> are some of the subjects on which Charles wrote many letters. The revival of strict observance of rule in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> was another matter to which Charles urged Ormaneto's attention; the setting up of grilles in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> parlours was ordered, and, to remove material difficulties, Charles ordered his agent, Albonese, to pay the cost of this where the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, through poverty, were unable to bear the expense. This order brought difficulties with his own relations. Two of his aunts, sisters of <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, had entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a>; they resented the setting up of the grilles as casting a slur on their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. Charles, in a letter (28th of April, 1565) displaying much thought and great tact, strove to bring his aunts to see the good purpose of the order, but without success, and the <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">pope</a> wrote on the 26th of May, 1565, telling them that he had given general orders for the setting up of the grilles, and that it would be pleasing to him that those united to him by ties of blood and affection should set a good example to other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>.

<p>Notwithstanding the support which Charles gave, Ormmaneto was discouraged by the checks with which he met, and wished to return to his own diocese. Charles pressed the <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">pope</a> to allow him to leave <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and at the same time encouraged Ormaneto to remain. At last the <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">pope</a> gave his consent to Charles visiting his flock and summoning a provincial council; but, desiring his stay to be short one, he created Charles <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> <em>a latere</em> for all <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Charles prepared to start, chose canonists to help the council, and wrote to the Court of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II</a>. He left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> 1 September, and, passing through <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, Bologna, <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, he made his solemn entry into <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> on Sunday, 23 September, 1565. His arrival was the occasion of great rejoicings, and the people did their utmost to welcome the first resident <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> for eighty years. On the following Sunday he preached in the Duomo, on the words: "With desire I have desired to eat this <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a> with you" (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#vrs15">Luke 22:15</a>).

<p>On the 15th of October the first provincial council met. It was attended by ten out of the fifteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province, those absent being represented by their procurators. Three of these <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> were <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and one, Nicol&ograve; Sfondrato of <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, was afterwards <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">pope</a> with the title of <a href="../cathen/07004a.htm">Gregory XIV</a>. Charles announced that the reform must begin with the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>: "We ought to walk in front, and our spiritual subjects will follow us more easily." He commenced by fulfilling all things required in himself, and his wonderful <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> astonished the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. The council was finished on the 3rd of November, and Charles sent a minute report to the <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">pope</a>. On the 6th of November he went to <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, to meet the Archduchesses Giovanna and Barbara, who were to be married to the Prince of <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a> and the Duke of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>. Charles conducted Barbara to <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> and Giovanna to <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, where at Fiorenzuola, he received the news of the <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">pope's</a> serious illness. He reached <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to find that the <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">pope's</a> condition was hopeless, and he at once bade the <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Holy Father</a> turn all his thoughts to his heavenly home. On the 10th of December <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> died, assisted by two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, Charles and Philip Neri. On the 7th of January, 1566, the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> for the election of his successor was concluded by the election of Cardinal Michele Ghislieri, O.P., of <a href="../cathen/01283d.htm">Alessandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10478a.htm">Mondov&igrave;</a>, who, at the request of Charles, took the name of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>. It had been maintained that Charles at first favoured <a href="../cathen/10575a.htm">Cardinal Morone</a>, but his letter to the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (Sylvain, I,309) seems to prove that he did his utmost to secure the election of Cardinal Ghislieri. <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> wished to keep Charles to assist him in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; but though Charles delayed his departure for some time, in the end his earnest representations obtained permission for him to return to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, at least for the summer. He returned to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, 5 April, 1566, having made a detour to visit the sanctuary of Our Lady of Loreto. Charles showed admirably how the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had the power to reform from within, and, though the task he had to do was gigantic, he set about its execution with great calmness and confidence. He began with his household, gave up much of his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and insisted that in all that concerned him personally the greatest economy should be used; for his position as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> he required due respect. He practised great <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, and whatever the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> or his own provincial council had laid down for the life of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> he carried out, not only in the letter, but also in the spirit.

<p>The rules for the management of his household, both in spiritual and temporal affairs, are to be found in the "Acta Ecclesiae Mediolanensis". The result of the care that was taken of his household was seen in the many members of it who became distinguished <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. More than twenty were chosen while members of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> household; one of these was Dr. Owen Lewis, fellow of New College, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, who taught at Oxford and <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, and after being <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to St. Charles was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cassano in Calabria.

<p>The administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> needed to be perfected; he therefore chose a <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of exemplary life, learned in law and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>. He also appointed two other vicars, one for civil and the other for criminal causes. He associated with them other officials, all chosen for their integrity, and took care that they should be well paid, so as to preclude all suspicion of venality. Corruption in such matters was specially distasteful to him. Whilst providing for upright officials, the needs of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> were not forgotten, and in time his court was known as the holy tribunal. He so organized his administration that by means of reports and conferences with the visitors and the vicars forane, his pastoral visits were productive of great fruit. The canons of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter were in turn the object of his reforming care. He put before them his plan of giving them definite work in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and in connexion with the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>. They welcomed his reforms, as he wrote to Monsignor Bonome: "The result of the way I have taken is very different to that in vogue today" (27 April, 1566). <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> congratulated Charles on his success and exhorted him to continue the work.

<p>Another great work which was begun at this time was that of the <a href="../cathen/03711b.htm">Confraternity of Christian Doctrine</a>, in order that the children might be carefully and systematically instructed. This work was really the beginning of what is now known as the Sunday <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and there is a remarkable testimony to this in an inscription under a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> outside the Essex <a href="../cathen/15154b.htm">Unitarian</a> Church, Kensington, London, where Cardinal Borromeo is mentioned in connexion with the work. The visitation of his flock was steadily carried out and various <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> foundations were made to succour the needy and sinners. In 1567 opposition began to be made to his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. The officials of the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> announced that they would inflict severe penalties on the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> officers if they <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> more <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, or carried arms. The matter was referred to the king, and finally to the <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">pope</a>, who counselled the Senate of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> to support the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. Peace was not restored; and the <em>bargello</em>, or sheriff, of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> announced sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> on the captain of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and several other officials. Much trouble followed, and again the matter was laid before the <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">pope</a>, who decided in favour of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>.

<p>In October, 1567, Charles started to visit three <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> valleys, Levantina, Bregno, and La Riviera. In most parts, indeed, there was much to reform. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> especially were in many cases so lax and careless, and even living <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> lives, that the people had grown to be equally negligent and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. The hardships of this journey were great; Charles travelled on a mule, but sometimes on foot, over most difficult and even dangerous ground. His labours bore great fruit, and a new spirit was put into both <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. In August, 1568, the second <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod was held, and it was followed in April, 1569, by the second provincial council. In August, 1569, matters came to a head in connexion with the collegiate church of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> della Scala. This church had been declared by <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>, in 1531, exempt from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, provided that the consent of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was obtained; but this consent had never been obtained, and consequently the exemption did not take effect. Now the governor, the Duke of Albuquerque, had been induced by the opponents of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> to issue an edict declaring that all who violated the king's <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> should receive severe punishment. The canons of La Scala claimed exemption from the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and relied on the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> to support them. Charles announced his intention of making his visitation in accordance with the wishes of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, by sending Monsignor Luigi Moneta to the canons. He was met with opposition and open insult. Early in September Charles himself went, vested for a visitation. The same violent demeanour was again shown. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> took the <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a> into his own hands and went forward to pronounce the sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. The armed men raised their weapons; the canons closed the door of the church against Charles, who with eyes fixed on the <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">crucifix</a>, recommended himself and these unworthy men to the Divine protection. Charles was indeed in danger of his life, for the canons' supporters opened fire, and the <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a> in his hand was damaged. His <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> then put up the public notice that the canons had incurred censures. This act was followed by blows and cries, removal of the notices, and the declaration that the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was himself suspended from his office. <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> was shocked at this incident, and only with very great difficulty allowed Charles to deal with these rebellious canons, when they repented.

<p>In October, 1569, Charles was again in great danger. The <a href="../cathen/07543a.htm">Order of the Humiliati</a>, of which he was protector, had by his persevering care been induced to accept certain reforms, in 1567. But some of its members strove to bring about a return to their former condition. As Charles would not consent to this, some of the order formed a conspiracy to take his life. On the 26th of October, whilst Charles was at evening <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> with his household, a member of the <a href="../cathen/07543a.htm">Humiliati</a>, dressed as a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, having entered with others of the public who were admitted to the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, took his stand four or five yards from the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10600c.htm">motet</a> "Tempus est ut revertar ad eum qui me misit", by Orlando Lasso, was being sung; the words "Non turbetur cor vestrum, neque formidet" had just been sung, when the assassin fired his weapon, loaded with ball, and struck Charles, who was kneeling at the altar. Charles, thinking himself mortally wounded, commended himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. A panic arose, which allowed the assassin to escape, but Charles motioned to his household to finish the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. At their conclusion it was found that the ball had not even pierced his clothes, but some of the shot had penetrated to the skin, and where the ball had struck a slight swelling appeared, which remained through his life.

<p>It was seen how far the unruly-minded had gone, and the serious turn affairs had taken. At once the governor took prompt steps to assure Charles of his sympathy and his wish to find the assassin. Charles would not allow this, and asked the governor to use his efforts to prevent the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> being infringed. In some measure this occurrence led the canons of La Scala to sue for pardon, and on the 5th of February, 1570, Charles publicly absolved them before the door of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Notwithstanding his wish to forgive those who had attempted his life, and his efforts to prevent their prosecution, four of the conspirators (amongst them Farina, who actually fired) were sentenced to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>. All being of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, they were handed over to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> (29 July, 1570); two were beheaded; Farina and another were hanged.

<p>Charles at this time made a second visit to <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, first visiting the three valleys of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, then over the mountains to see his half-sister Ortensia, Countess d'Altemps. Afterwards he visited all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cantons, everywhere using his influence to remove abuses both among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, and to restore religious observance in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>. He visited Altorf, Unterwalden, <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>, <a href="../cathen/13349a.htm">Saint Gall</a>, Schwyz, <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a>, where he said that he nowhere except at Loreto, experienced a greater religious feeling (10 September, 1570). Heresy had spread in many of these parts, and Charles sent to them experienced missionaries to win back those who had embraced it.

<p>At this time <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> came to the conclusion that nothing less than the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/07543a.htm">Order of the Humiliati</a> was adequate. He therefore issued a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> (7 February, 1571) suppressing the order and providing for its <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. This same year, owing to the short harvest, the whole province suffered from a terrible famine, during which Charles worked with unceasing toil to help the starving, relieving at his own expense as many as 3000 daily for three months. His example induced others to help, the governor, especially, giving large <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. In the summer of 1571 Charles was for somme time seriously ill, in the month of August; having partly recovered, he was making his visitation when he heard of the serious illness of the governor, the Duke of Albuquerque. Charles returned to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> only in time to console the duchess. He made use of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> ordered by <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> for the success of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, to urge on his flock the necessity of averting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> by penance. Great were the rejoicings at the victory of <a href="../cathen/09181b.htm">Lepanto</a> (7 October, 1571). Charles was especially interested in this expedition by reason of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> ships being commanded by Marco Antonio Colonna, whose son Fabricio was married to his sister, Anna Borromeo.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> remained in bad health, suffering from low fever and catarrh. It was feared that consumption would set in; in spite of his illness he prepared for the third <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod, which was held in his absence in April, 1572. He soon afterwards heard of the death of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> (1 May, 1572), and, though feeble, he started for the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a>, which lasted one day and resulted in the election of Cardinal Ugo Buoncompagni, with the title of <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>, 13 May, 1572. As medical treatment had not restored Charles to health, he now abandoned it and returned to his ordinary rule of life, with the result that he was before long quite well. On his homeward journey he again visited Loreto, in November, and reached <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> on 12 November. He at this time resigned the offices of Grand Penitentiary, Archpriest of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Maggiore, and other high dignities. In April, 1573, he held his third provincial council.

<p>The new governor of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> was Don Luigi di Requesens, who had known Charles in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. However, as soon as he took office, being urged by the opponents of Charles, he published some letters falsely incriminating Charles in questions of the royal authority and containing much that was contrary to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Charles protested against their publication; with great reluctance, and after much anxious deliberation, he publicly pronounced, in August, sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> explicitly against the grand Chancellor and implicitly against the governor. As a consequence of this, <a href="../cathen/09210a.htm">libels</a> were published in the city against Charles. The governor showed his displeasure by placing restrictions on the meetings of the confraternities, also depriving Charles of the Castle of Arona. Various rumours were in circulation of more wicked plans against Charles, but his tranquillity was maintained, and he carried on his work with his usual care, despite the fact that the governor had placed an armed guard to watch his palace. None of the governor's actions succeeding, the governor was led to ask for <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, which he obtained by deception. When <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> learned of this, he compelled the governor to make satisfaction to Charles. This was done, and on 26 November Charles announced that the governor was absolved from all penalties and censures. In this year Charles founded a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for the nobility at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>.

<p>In August, 1574, Henry III of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was passing through the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Diocese of Milan</a> on his way from <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> to take the French throne. Charles met him at Monza. The fourth <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod was in November, 1574. <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> proclaimed a jubilee for 1575, and on the 8th of December, 1574, Charles left for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He visited many shrines and, having reached <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, performed the required devotions and started for <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, in February. He assisted at the death-bed of his brother-in-law, Cesare Gonzaga, and continued the visitation of his province. In 1576 the jubilee was kept in the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Diocese of Milan</a>. It began on the 2nd of February. Whilst the jubilee was being celebrated, news came of the outbreak of plague in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>. The fourth provincial council was held in May. In August, Don John of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, visited <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. Religious exercises were being carried out, and his arrival was made the occasion of rejoicings and spectacular effects. All at once everything was changed, for the plague appeared in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. Charles was at <a href="../cathen/09322b.htm">Lodi</a>, at the funeral of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He at once returned, and inspired confidence in all. He was convinced that the plague was sent as a chastisement for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, abd sought all the more to give himself to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. At the same time he thought of the people. He prepared himself for death, made his will (9 September, 1576), and then gave himself up entirely to his people. Personal visits were paid by him to the plague-stricken houses. In the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of St. Gregory were the worst cases; to this he went, and his presence comforted the sufferers. Though he worked so arduously himself, it was only after many trials that the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> of the town were induced to assist him, but his persuasive words at last won them so that they afterwards aided him in every way. It was at this time that, wishing to do penance for his people, he walked in procession, barefooted, with a rope round his neck, at one time bearing in his hand the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the Holy Nail.

<p>At the beginning of 1577 the plague began to abate, and though there was a temporary increase in the number of cases, at last it ceased. The <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> vowed to build a church dedicated to St. Sebastian, if he would deliver them. This promise was fulfilled. Charles wrote at this time the "Memoriale", a small work, addressed to his suffragans, which had for its object to recall the lessons given by the cessation of the plague. He also compiled books of devotion for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of every state of life. By the beginning of 1578 the plague had quite disappeared from all parts. At the end of 1578 the fifth <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod was held. It lasted three days. Charles endeavoured at this time to induce the canons of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> to unite with himself in community life. In this year, on the 16th of August, he began the foundation of the congregation of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> under the patronage of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> and St. Ambrose, giving it the title of the Oblates of St. Ambrose. Though he had been helped by various orders of religious, especially by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a>, one of whom (now <a href="../cathen/01299b.htm">Bl. Alexander Sauli</a>) was for many years his constant adviser, yet he felt the need of a body of men who could act as his assistants and, living in community, would be more easily impressed by his spirit and wishes. He was the master mind of this new congregation, and he ever insisted on the need of complete union between himself and its members. It was his delight to be with them, and, looking to him as a father, they were ready to go where he wished, to undertake works of every kind. He placed them in <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and confraternities. The remaining <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were held in 1579 and succeeding years, the last (the eleventh) in 1584.

<p>His first <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, to visit the Holy Shroud, was in 1578. About this time he first visited the holy mountain of Varallo to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">meditate</a> on the mysteries of the Passion in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> there. In 1578-9 the Marquis of Ayamonte, the successor of Requesens as governor, opposed the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, and in September of the latter year Charles went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to obtain a decision on the question of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. The dispute arose in consequence of the governor ordering the carnival to be celebrated with additional festivities on the first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, against the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> orders. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> confirmed the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, and urged the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> to submit. The envoys sent by them were so ashamed that they would not themselves present the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> reply. <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> had welcomed Charles and rejoiced at his presence. Charles did much work during his stay for his province, especially for <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. In connexion with the rule which Charles drew up for the Oblates of St. Ambrose, it is to be noted that when in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he submitted it to <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a>, who advised Charles to exclude the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty. Charles defended its inclusion, so St. Philip said, "We will put it to the judgment of Brother Felix". This brother was a simple <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, close to the Piazza Barberini. St. Philip and St. Charles went to him, and he put his finger on the article dealing with the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty, and said, "This is what should be effaced". Felix was also a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, and is known as St. Felix of Cantalicio. Charles returned to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> by <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, Bologna, and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, everywhere reviving the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> spirit. When he reached <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of his people was great, for it had been said he would not return. After the beginning of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> (1580), Charles began his visitation at <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>; soon after, in April, he was called back to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> to assist at the death-bed of the governor, Ayamonte. In this year Charles visited the Valtelline valley in the Grisons. In July he was brought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a youth who afterwards reached great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. He was invited by the Marquis Gonzaga to stay with him, and refused, but while staying at the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest's</a> house he met the eldest son of the marquis, Luigi Gonzaga, then twelve years old, now raised to the altars of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as <a href="../cathen/01331c.htm">St. Aloysius Gonzaga, S.J.</a>. Charles gave him his first <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Communion</a>. The next year (1581) Charles sent to the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> a special envoy in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Father Charles Bascape of the <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a>, charging him to endeavour to come to an understanding on the question of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. The result was that a governor, the Duke of Terra Nova, was sent, who was instructed to act in concert with Charles. After this no further controversy arose.

<p>In 1582 Charles started on his last journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, both in obedience to the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, and to have the decrees of the sixth provincial council confirmed. This was his last visit, and during it he resided at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> attached to his titular church of Santa Prassede, where still are shown pieces of furniture used by him. He left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in January, 1583, and travelled by Sienna and Mantua, where he had been commissioned by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to pronounce a judgment. A great portion of this year was taken up by visitations. In November he began a visitation as <a href="../cathen/15483a.htm">Apostolic visitor</a> of all the cantons of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> and the Grisons, leaving the affairs of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in the hands of Monsignor Owen Lewis, his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. He began in the Mesoleina Valley; here not only was there <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> to be fought, but also <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witchcraft</a> and <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">sorcery</a>, and at Roveredo it was discovered that the <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, was the foremost in sorceries. Charles spent considerable time in setting right this terrible state of things. It was his especial care to leave <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and good religious to guide the people. Next he visited Bellinzona and Ascona, working strenuously to extirpate <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and meeting with much opposition from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Coire. The negotiations were continued into the next year, the last of Charles on earth. All his work bore fruit, and his efforts in these part ensured the preservation of the Faith. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> spread <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> reports that Charles was really working for <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> against the inhabitants of the Grisons. In spite of their falsehoods Charles continued to attack them and to defend <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who had much to suffer.

<p>At the end of 1584 he had an attack of erysipelas in one leg, which <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to remain in bed. He however has a congress of the rural deans, sixty in number, with whom he fully discussed the needs of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He also made great exertions to suppress the licentiousness of the carnival. Knowing the needs of the invalids who left the great <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> he determined to found a convalescent <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. He did not live to see it completed, but his immediate successor saw that the work was executed. During September and early October he was at <a href="../cathen/11134b.htm">Novara</a>, <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>. On the 8th of October he left <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> and thence travelled to Monte Varallo. He was going to <a href="../cathen/04660c.htm">prepare for death</a>. His confessor, <a href="../cathen/01154a.htm">Father Adorno</a>, was told to join him. On 15 October he began the exercises by making a general confession. On the 18th the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a> summoned him to Arona to discuss urgent and important business. The night before Charles spent eight hours in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> on his knees. On the 20th he was back at Varallo; on the 24th an attack of fever came on; he concealed it at first, but suffering from sickness he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to declare his state. For five days this state lasted, but still he said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> and gave <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Communion</a> daily, and carried on his correspondence. He seemed to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that death was at hand and determined to work as long as he had strength left. The foundation of the college at Ascona was not completed, and it was urgent that it should be finished in a short time, so Charles pressed on and started, in spite of his sufferings, on 29 October, having previously paid a farewell visit to the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. He was found prostrate in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> where the burial of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> was represented. He rode to Arona, thence went by boat to Canobbio, where he stayed the night, said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> on the 30th, and proceeded to Ascona. He visited the college, and afterwards set out at night for Canobbio, staying a short time at Locarno, where he intended to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> a cemetery, but, finding himself without his pontifical vestments, he abandoned the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. When he reached Canobbio the fever was decreasing, and he was very weak. The next day he took the boat for Arona and stayed there with the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, at the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> he had founded, and on <a href="../cathen/01315a.htm">All Saints' Day</a> he said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> for the last time, giving <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Communion</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> and many of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. The next day he assisted at Mass and received <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>. His cousin, Rene Borromeo, accompanied him on the boat, and that evening he reached <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. It was not known there that he was ill. He at once was visited by <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, whose orders he obeyed. He would not allow Mass to be said in his room. A picture of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> was before him, together with two others of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> at Gethsemani and the body of the dead Christ. The physicians regarded the danger as extreme, and though there was a slight improvement, it was not maintained, and the fever returned with great severity. The <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> gave him the <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">Viaticum</a>, which he received vested in <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a> and stole. The administration of extreme unction was suggested. "At once", Charles replied. It was at once given, and afterwards he showed but little sign of life. The governor, the Duke of Terra Nova, arrived after great difficulty in getting through the crowds which surrounded and had entered the palace. The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for a passing <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were said, the Passion was read, with Father Bascap&egrave; and <a href="../cathen/01154a.htm">Father Adorno</a> at the bedside, the words "Ecce venio" (Behold I come) being the last words he was heard to utter (3 November, 1584). On the 7th of November his requiem was sung by Cardinal Nicol&ograve; Sfondrato, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/07004a.htm">Gregory XIV</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> at night in the spot which he had chosen.

<p>Devotion to him as a saint was at once shown and gradually grew, and the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> kept his anniversary as though he were <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>. This veneration, at first private, became universal, and after 1601 Cardinal <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> wrote that it was no longer <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to keep his anniversary by a requiem Mass, and that the solemn Mass of the day should be sung. Then materials were collected for his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>, and processes were begun at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, Bologna, and other places. In 1604 the cause was sent to the Congregation of Rites. Finally, 1 November, 1610, <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> solemnly <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> Charles Borromeo, and fixed his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> for the 4th day of November.

<p>The position which Charles held in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> was indeed a very remarkable one. The mass of correspondence both to and by him testifies to the way in which his opinion was sought. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> under whom he lived &#151; as has been shown above &#151; sought his advice. The sovereigns of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, Henry III of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II</a>, <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Queen of Scots</a>, and others showed how they valued his influence. His brother <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> have written in praise of his virtues. Cardinal Valerio of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> said of him that he was to the well-born a pattern of virtue, to his brother <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> an example of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nobility. Cardinal <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> styled him "a second Ambrose, whose early death, lamented by all good men, inflicted great loss on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>".

<p>It is a matter of interest to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> late in the sixteenth or at the beginning of the seventeenth century had circulated some life of St. Charles in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Doubtless some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of him had been brought to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> by <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Blessed Edmund Campion, S.J.</a>, who visited him at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> in 1580, on his way to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, stopped with him some eight days, and conversed with him every day after dinner. Charles had much to do with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in the days of his assistance to <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, and he had a great veneration for the portrait of <a href="../cathen/08462b.htm">Bishop Fisher</a>. Charles also had much to do with <a href="../cathen/06213a.htm">Francis Borgia</a>, General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and with <a href="../cathen/01472b.htm">Andrew of Avellino</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a>, who gave great help to his work in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>.
