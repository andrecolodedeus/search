<h1>St. Christopher</h1>  

<p>(Greek <em>christos</em>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <em>pherein</em>, to bear. Latin <em>Christophorus</em>, i.e. Christbearer).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, probably of the third century. Although St. Christopher is one of the most popular <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in the East and in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a>, almost nothing <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> about his life or death.

<p>The legend says: A <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> king (in <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Canaan</a> or <a href="../cathen/01674a.htm">Arabia</a>), through the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of his wife to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, had a son, whom he called Offerus (Offro, Adokimus, or Reprebus) and <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to the gods Machmet and Apollo. Acquiring in time extraordinary size and strength, Offerus resolved to serve only the strongest and the bravest. He bound himself successively to a mighty king and to <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, but he found both lacking in <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, the former dreading even the name of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and the latter frightened by the sight of a cross at the roadside.

<p>For a time his search for a new master was in vain, but at last he found a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> (Babylas?) who told him to offer his allegiance to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, instructed him in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> him. Christopher, as he was now called, would not promise to do any <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> or <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, but willingly accepted the task of carrying people, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake, across a raging stream. One day he was carrying a child who continually grew heavier, so that it seemed to him as if he had the whole world on his shoulders. The child, on inquiry, made himself known as the Creator and Redeemer of the world. To <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> his statement the child ordered Christopher to fix his staff in the ground. The next morning it had grown into a palm-tree bearing fruit. The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> many. This excited the rage of the king (prefect) of that region (Dagnus of Samos in Lycia?). Christopher was put into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and, after many cruel torments, beheaded.

<p>The Greek legend may belong to the sixth century; about the middle of the ninth, we find it spread through <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Originally, St. Christopher was only a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, and as such is recorded in the old <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a>. The simple form of the Greek and <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <em>passio</em> soon gave way to more elaborate legends. We have the Latin edition in prose and verse of 983 by the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> Walter of Speyer, "Thesaurus anecdotorum novissimus" (Augsburg, 1721-23), II, 27-142, and Harster, "Walter von Speyer" (1878). An edition of the eleventh century is found in the Acta SS., and another in the "Golden Legend" of <a href="../cathen/08262b.htm">Jacob de Voragine</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> conveyed in the name, at first understood in the spiritual sense of bearing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the heart, was in the twelfth or thirteenth century taken in the realistic meaning and became the characteristic of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. The fact that he was frequently called a great <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> may have given rise to the story of his enormous size. The stream and the weight of the child may have been intended to denote the trials and struggles of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> taking upon itself the yoke of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in this world.

<p>The existence of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> St. Christopher cannot be denied, as was sufficiently shown by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Nicholas Serarius, in his treatise on <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a>, "Litaneutici" (Cologne, 1609), and by Molanus in his history of sacred pictures, "De picturis et imaginibus sacris" (Louvain, 1570). In a small church <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> St. Christopher, the body of <a href="../cathen/12763b.htm">St. Remigius of Reims</a> was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a>, 532 (Acta SS., 1 Oct., 161). <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> (d. 604) speaks of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Christopher (Epp., x., 33). The <a href="../cathen/10611a.htm">Mozarabic</a> <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> and <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">St. Isidore of Seville</a> (d. 636), contains a special office in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. In 1386 a brotherhood was founded under the patronage of St. Christopher in Tyrol and Vorarlberg, to guide travellers over the Arlberg. In 1517, a St. Christopher <a href="../cathen/14482a.htm">temperance society</a> existed in Carinthia, <a href="../cathen/14318a.htm">Styria</a>, in <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, and at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>. Great veneration was shown to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, along the shores of the Danube, the Rhine, and other rivers where floods or ice-jams <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> frequent damage. The oldest picture of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a> dates from the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Justinian</a> (527-65). <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">Coins</a> with his image were cast at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, in <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>.

<p>His <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> were placed at the entrances of churches and dwellings, and frequently at bridges; these <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> and his <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">pictures</a> often bore the inscription: "Whoever shall behold the image of St. Christopher shall not faint or fall on that day." The saint, who is one of the fourteen <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> helpers, has been chosen as <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron</a> by <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a>, by <a href="../cathen/03019a.htm">Brunswick</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/10107a.htm">Mecklenburg</a>, and several other cities, as well as by bookbinders, gardeners, mariners, etc. He is invoked against lightning, storms, epilepsy, pestilence, etc. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 25 July; among the Greeks, on 9 March; and his emblems are the tree, the Christ Child, and a staff. St. Christopher's Island (commonly called St. Kitts), lies 46 miles west of Antigua in the Lesser Antilles.
