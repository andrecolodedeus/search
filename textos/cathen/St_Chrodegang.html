<h1>St. Chrodegang</h1>  

<p>(Called also CHRODEGAND, GODEGRAND, GUNDIGRAN, RATGANG, RODIGANG and SIRIGANG).

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, born at the beginning of the eighth century at Hasbania, in what is now <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Limburg, of a noble <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; died at <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, 6 March, 766. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the court of <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a>, became his private secretary, then chancellor, and in 737 prime minister. On 1 March, 742, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, retaining his civil office at the request of Pepin. In his influential position St. Chrodegang laboured earnestly for the welfare of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, and was ever solicitous to strengthen the bonds of union between the temporal and spiritual rulers. In his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> he introduced the Roman Liturgy and chant, community life for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and wrote a special rule for them. He founded (748) the Abbey of Gorze (near Metz), and remained its friend and protector. He also established St. Peter's Abbey, on the Moselle, and did much for Gengenbach and Lorsch. For the latter he is said to have obtained the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/10727b.htm">St. Nazarius</a>, and for Gorze those of <a href="../cathen/06651b.htm">St. Gorgonius</a>. In 753 he was sent by Pepin to <a href="../cathen/14288c.htm">Pope Stephen III</a> to assure him of the sympathy of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> rulers against the inroads of <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">Aistulf</a>, King of the Lombards. He accompanied the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to Ponthieu. After the death of <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, Pope Stephen conferred the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> on St. Chrodegang (754-755), thus making him an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, but not elevating the <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">See of Metz</a>. St. Chrodegang was buried in the Abbey of Gorze. He was a man of imposing appearance, of a mild, though firm, character, of great liberality to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and of more than ordinary ability, well versed in Latin and German. The rule containing thirty-four chapters which he gave his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (c. 755) was modeled according to the rules of St. Benedict and of the Canons of the Lateran (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XIV, 313; <a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a>, IV 1181; <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., LXXXIX, 1097). Through it he gave a might impulse to the spread of community life among the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. It was later increased to eighty-six chapters (D'Archey, Spicilegium, I, 656). In 762, during a dangerous illness, he introduced among his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> a confraternity of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> known as the League of Attigny.
