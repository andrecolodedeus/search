<h1>St. Clare of Assisi</h1>  

<p>Cofoundress of the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Order of Poor Ladies</a>, or Clares, and first <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of San Damiano; born at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, 16 July, 1194; died there 11 August, 1253.

<p>She was the eldest daughter of Favorino Scifi, Count of Sasso-Rosso, the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> representative of an ancient Roman <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, who owned a large palace in <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a> and a castle on the slope of Mount Subasio. Such at least is the traditional account. Her mother, Bl. Ortolana, belonged to the noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Fiumi and was conspicuous for her <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>.

<p>From her earliest years Clare seems to have been endowed with the rarest <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. As a child she was most devoted to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and to practices of <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, and as she passed into girlhood her distaste for the world and her yearning for a more spiritual life increased. She was eighteen years of age when <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a> came to preach the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> course in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of San Giorgio at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>. The inspired words of the <em><a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">Poverello</a></em> kindled a flame in the heart of Clare; she sought him out secretly and begged him to help her that she too might live "after the manner of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">holy Gospel</a>". <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a>, who at once recognized in Clare one of those chosen <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> destined by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for great things, and who also, doubtless, foresaw that many would follow her example, promised to assist her. On <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a> Clare, arrayed in all her finery, attended high <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, but when the others pressed forward to the <a href="../cathen/01356c.htm">altar-rail</a> to receive a <a href="../cathen/11432a.htm">branch of palm</a>, she remained in her place as if <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt in a dream</a>. All eyes were upon the young girl as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> descended from the <a href="../cathen/13431a.htm">sanctuary</a> and placed the <a href="../cathen/11432a.htm">palm</a> in her hand. That was the last <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the world beheld Clare. On the night of the same day she secretly left her father's house, by <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis's</a> advice and, accompanied by her aunt Bianca and another companion, proceeded to the humble <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12286a.htm">Porziuncula</a>, where <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> met her with <a href="../cathen/09244b.htm">lights</a> in their hands. Clare then laid aside her rich dress, and <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a>, having cut off her <a href="../cathen/07113a.htm">hair</a>, clothed her in a rough tunic and a thick veil, and in this way the young heroine <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vowed</a> herself to the service of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. This was 20 March, 1212.

<p>Clare was placed by <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a> provisionally with the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of San Paolo, near Bastia, but her father, who had expected her to make a splendid <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriage</a>, and who was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> at her secret flight, on discovering her retreat, did his utmost to dissuade Clare from her heroic proposals, and even tried to drag her home by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">force</a>. But Clare held her own with a firmness above her years, and Count Favorino was finally obliged to leave her in peace. A few days later <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a>, in order to secure Clare the greater solitude she desired, transferred her to Sant' Angelo in Panzo, another <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> on one of the flanks of Subasio. Here some sixteen days after her own flight, Clare was joined by her younger sister <a href="../cathen/01213a.htm">Agnes</a>, whom she was instrumental in delivering from the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">infuriated</a> relatives. Clare and her sister remained with the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> at Sant' Angelo until they and the other fugitives from the world who had followed them were established by <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a> in a rude dwelling adjoining the poor <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of San Damiano, situated outside the town which he had to a great extent rebuilt with his own hands, and which he now obtained from the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> as a permanent abode for his spiritual daughters. Thus was founded the first community of the Order of Poor Ladies, or of <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, as this second order of St. Francis came to be called.

<p>The history of the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a> will be dealt with in a separate article. Here it suffices to note that we may distinguish, during the lifetime of St. Clare, three stages in the complicated early history of the new order.

<p>In the beginning St. Clare and her companions had no written rule to follow beyond a very short <em>formula vitae</em> given them by <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a>, and which may be found among his works. Some years later, apparently in 1219, during <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis's</a> absence in the East, <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Cardinal Ugolino</a>, then <a href="../cathen/03341a.htm">protector</a> of the order, afterwards <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, drew up a written rule for the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Clares</a> at Monticelli, taking as a basis the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>, retaining the fundamental points of the latter and adding some special constitutions. This new rule, which, in effect if not in intention, took away from the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Clares</a> the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> character of absolute <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> so dear to the heart of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a> and made them for all practical purposes a congregation of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, was approved by <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "Sacrosancta", 9 Dec., 1219). When Clare found that the new rule, though strict enough in other respects, allowed the holding of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in common, she <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageously</a> and successfully resisted the innovations of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Ugolino</a> as being entirely opposed to the intentions of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a>. The latter had forbidden the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Ladies</a>, just as he had forbidden his <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> to possess any <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">worldly goods</a> even in common. Owning nothing, they were to depend entirety upon what the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> could beg for them. This complete renunciation of all <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was however regarded by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Ugolino</a> as unpractical for <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloistered</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. When, therefore, in 1228, he came to <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a> for the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a> (having meanwhile ascended the <a href="../cathen/03551e.htm">pontifical throne</a> as <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>), he visited St. Clare at San Damiano and pressed her to so far deviate from the practice of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> which had up to this <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> obtained at San Damiano, as to accept some provision for the unforeseen wants of the community. But Clare firmly refused. <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory</a>, thinking that her refusal might be due to fear of violating the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of strict <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> she had taken, offered to absolve her from it. "Holy Father, I crave for <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>", replied Clare, "but I desire not to be absolved from the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of following <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>".

<p>The heroic unworldliness of Clare filled the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with admiration, as his <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">letters</a> to her, still extant, bear eloquent witness, and he so far gave way to her views as to grant her on 17 September, 1228, the celebrated <em>Privilegium Paupertatis</em> which some regard in the light of a corrective of the Rule of 1219. The original autograph copy of this unique <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">"privilege"</a>--the first one of its kind ever sought for, or ever issued by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>--is preserved in the <a href="../cathen/01696a.htm">archive</a> at Santa Chiara in <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>. The text is as follows:

<blockquote><p><a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/13737a.htm">Servant of the Servants of God</a>. To our beloved daughters in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Clare and the other handmaids of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> dwelling together at the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Damiano in the <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Diocese of Assisi</a>. Health and <a href="../cathen/02602a.htm">Apostolic benediction</a>. It is evident that the desire of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> yourselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone has led you to abandon every wish for temporal things. Wherefore, after having sold all your <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">goods</a> and having distributed them among the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, you propose to have absolutely no possessions, in order to follow in all things the example of Him Who became <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> and Who is the way, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the life. Neither does the want of necessary things deter you from such a proposal, for the left arm of your <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Celestial Spouse</a> is beneath your head to sustain the infirmity of your body, which, according to the order of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, you have subjected to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>. Finally, He who feeds the birds of the air and who gives the lilies of the field their raiment and their nourishment, will not leave you in want of clothing or of food until He shall come Himself to minister to you in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> when, namely, the right hand of His consolations shall embrace you in the plenitude of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">Beatific Vision</a>. Since, therefore, you have asked for it, we confirm by Apostolic favour your resolution of the loftiest <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> and by the authority of these present <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">letters</a> grant that you may not be constrained by anyone to receive possessions. To no one, therefore, be it allowed to infringe upon this page of our concession or to oppose it with rash temerity. But if anyone shall presume to attempt this, be it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him that he shall incur the wrath of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Blessed Apostles</a>, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. Given at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> on the fifteenth of the Kalends of October in the second year of our Pontificate."</p></blockquote>

<p>That St. Clare may have solicited a <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">"privilege"</a> similar to the foregoing at an earlier date and obtained it <em>viv&acirc; voce</em>, is not improbable. <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">Certain</a> it is that after the death of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> Clare had once more to contend for the principle of absolute <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> prescribed by <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a>, for <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> would fain have given the Clares a new and mitigated rule, and the firmness with which she held to her way won over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Finally, two days before her death, <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent</a>, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> at the reiterated request of the dying <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>, solemnly confirmed the definitive Rule of the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Clares</a> (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "Solet Annuere", 9 August, 1253), and thus secured to them the precious treasure of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> which Clare, in imitation of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a>, had taken for her portion from the beginning of her <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>. The author of this latter rule, which is largely an adaptation <em>mutatis mutandis</em>, of the rule which <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a> composed for the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> in 1223, seems to have been Cardinal Rainaldo, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03341a.htm">protector</a> of the order, afterwards <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a>, though it is most likely that St. Clare herself had a hand in its compilation. Be this as it may, it can no longer be maintained that <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a> was in any sense the author of this formal Rule of the Clares; he only gave to St. Clare and her companions at the outset of their <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> the brief <em>formula vivendi</em> already mentioned.

<p>St. Clare, who in 1215 had, much against her will been made superior at San Damiano by <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a>, continued to rule there as <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> until her death, in 1253, nearly forty years later. There is no good reason to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that she ever once went beyond the boundaries of San Damiano during all that <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. It need not, therefore, be wondered at if so comparatively few details of St. Clare's life in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> "hidden with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>", have come down to us. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that she became a living copy of the <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a>; that she had a special devotion to the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, and that in order to increase her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> crucified she learned by heart the Office of the Passion composed by <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a>, and that during the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> that remained to her after her <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotional exercises</a> she engaged in manual labour. Needless to add, that under St. Clare's guidance the community of San Damiano became the <a href="../cathen/13431a.htm">sanctuary</a> of every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, a very nursery of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Clare had the consolation not only of seeing her younger sister Beatrix, her mother Ortolana, and her faithful aunt Bianca follow <a href="../cathen/01213a.htm">Agnes</a> into the order, but also of witnessing the foundation of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Clares</a> far and wide throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. It would be difficult, moreover, to estimate how much the silent influence of the gentle <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> did towards guiding the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to higher aims. In particular, Clare threw around <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> that irresistible charm which only <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> can communicate to <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> or civic heroism, and she became a most efficacious coadjutrix of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a> in promoting that spirit of unworldliness which in the counsels of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, "was to bring about a restoration of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> and civilization in the peoples of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>". Not the least important part of Clare's work was the aid and encouragement she gave <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a>. It was to her he turned when in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and it was she who urged him to continue his mission to the people at a time when he thought his <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">vocation</a> lay rather in a life of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. When in an attack of blindness and illness, <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a> came for the last time to visit San Damiano, Clare erected a little wattle hut for him in an olive grove close to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and it was here that he composed his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> "Canticle of the Sun". After <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis's</a> death the <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> which accompanied his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">remains</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12286a.htm">Porziuncula</a> to the town stopped on the way at San Damiano in order that Clare and her daughters might venerate the <a href="../cathen/14294b.htm">pierced hands and feet</a> of him who had formed them to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> crucified--a pathetic scene which <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a> has commemorated in one of his loveliest frescoes. So far, however, as Clare was concerned, <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a> was always living, and nothing is, perhaps, more striking in her after-life than her unswerving loyalty to the ideals of the <em><a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">Poverello</a></em>, and the jealous care with which she clung to his rule and teaching.

<p>When, in 1234, the army of <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> was devastating the valley of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, the soldiers, preparatory to an assault upon <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, scaled the walls of San Damiano by night, spreading terror among the community. Clare, calmly rising from her sick bed, and taking the <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a> from the little <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> adjoining her cell, proceeded to face the invaders at an open <a href="../cathen/15653b.htm">window</a> against which they had already placed a ladder. It is related that, as she raised the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> on high, the soldiers who were about to enter the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> fell backward as if dazzled, and the others who were ready to follow them took flight. It is with reference to this incident that St. Clare is generally represented in <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a> bearing a <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a>.

<p>When, some time later, a larger force returned to storm <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, headed by the General Vitale di Aversa who had not been present at the first attack, Clare, gathering her daughters about her, knelt with them in earnest <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that the town might be spared. Presently a furious storm arose, scattering the tents of the soldiers in every direction, and causing such a panic that they again took refuge in flight. The gratitude of the <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisians</a>, who with one accord attributed their deliverance to Clare's <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a>, increased their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the "Seraphic Mother". Clare had long been enshrined in the hearts of the people, and their <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">veneration</a> became more apparent as, wasted by illness and austerities, she drew towards her end. <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">Brave</a> and cheerful to the last, in spite of her long and painful infirmities, Clare caused herself to be raised in bed and, thus reclining, says her contemporary biographer "she spun the finest thread for the purpose of having it woven into the most delicate material from which she afterwards made more than one hundred <a href="../cathen/04386c.htm">corporals</a>, and, enclosing them in a silken <a href="../cathen/03084b.htm">burse</a>, ordered them to be given to the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> in the plain and on the mountains of <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>". When at length she felt the day of her death approaching, Clare, calling her sorrowing <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> around her, reminded them of the many benefits they had received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and exhorted them to persevere faithfully in the observance of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">evangelical poverty</a>. <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Pope Innocent IV</a> came from <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> to visit the dying <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, who had already received the last <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> from the hands of Cardinal Rainaldo. Her own sister, <a href="../cathen/01214a.htm">St. Agnes</a>, had returned from <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a> to console Clare in her last illness; <a href="../cathen/09173a.htm">Leo</a>, Angelo, and Juniper, three of the early companions of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a>, were also present at the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> death-bed, and at St. Clare's request read aloud the <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">Passion of Our Lord</a> according to <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">St. John</a>, even as they had done twenty-seven years before, when <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">Francis</a> lay dying at the <a href="../cathen/12286a.htm">Porziuncula</a>. At length before dawn on 11 August, 1253, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> foundress of the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Ladies</a> passed peacefully away amid scenes which her contemporary biographer has recorded with touching simplicity. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, with his court, came to San Damiano for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> funeral, which partook rather of the nature of a triumphal <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a>.

<p>The Clares desired to retain the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">body</a> of their foundress among them at San Damiano, but the magistrates of <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a> interfered and took measures to secure for the town the <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">remains</a> of her whose <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, as they all <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, had on two occasions saved it from destruction. Clare's <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> too were talked of far and wide. It was not safe, the <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisians</a> urged, to leave Clare's <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">body</a> in a lonely spot without the walls; it was only right, too, that Clare, "the chief rival of the <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">Blessed Francis</a> in the observance of <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">Gospel perfection</a>", should also have a <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> in <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a> built in her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. Meanwhile, Clare's <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">remains</a> were placed in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of San Giorgio, where <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis's</a> preaching had first touched her young heart, and where his own <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">body</a> had likewise been <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> pending the erection of the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">Basilica</a> of San Francesco. Two years later, 26 September, 1255, Clare was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a>, and not long afterwards the building of the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of Santa Chiara, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi's</a> second great <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, was begun under the direction of Filippo Campello, one of the foremost <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architects</a> of the time. On 3 October, 1260, Clare's <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">remains</a> were transferred from the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of San Giorgio and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> deep down in the earth, under the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> in the new <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a>, far out of sight and reach. After having remained hidden for six centuries--like the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">remains</a> of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a>--and after much search had been made, Clare's <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> was found in 1850, to the great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisians</a>. On 23 September in that year the coffin was unearthed and opened, the flesh and clothing of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> had been reduced to dust, but the skeleton was in a perfect state of preservation. Finally, on the 29th of September, 1872, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">bones</a> were transferred, with much pomp, by Archbishop Pecci, afterwards <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, to the shrine, in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> at Santa Chiara, erected to receive them, and where they may now be seen. The <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of St. Clare is celebrated throughout the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on 12 August <span class="stiki">later changed to 11 August &#151; <em>Ed.</em></span>; the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of her first translation is kept in the order on 3 October, and that of the finding of her <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">body</a> on 23 September.

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The sources of the history of St. Clare at our disposal are few in number. They include (1) a <em>Testament</em> attributed to the saint and some charming <em>Letters</em> written by her to Blessed Agnes, Princess of Bohemia; (2) the <em>Rule of the Clares</em>, and a certain number of early <em>Pontifical Bulls relating to the Order;</em> (3) a contemporary <em>Biography</em>, written in 1256 by order of Alexander IV. This life, which is now generally ascribed to Thomas of Celano, is the source from which St. Clare's subsequent biographers have derived most of their information.</p></div>
