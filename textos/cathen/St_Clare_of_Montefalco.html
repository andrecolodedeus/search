<h1>St. Clare of Montefalco</h1>  

<p>Born at Montefalco about 1268; died there, 18 August, 1308. Much dispute has existed as to whether St. Clare of Montefalco was a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> or an Augustinian; and while <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Wadding</a>, with <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> biographers of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, contends that she was a member of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis, Augustinian writers, whom <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">the Bollandists</a> seem to favour, hold that she belonged to their order. It seems, however, more probable to say that St. Clare, when she was still a very young girl, embraced the rule of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis (secular), together with her older sister and a number of other <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> young <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maidens</a>, who wore the habit of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis and followed that particular mode of life in community which their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and fervour suggested. When later, however, they became desirous of entering the religous state in its strict sense, and of professing the three <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of religion, they petitioned the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> for an approved rule of life; and, the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis (regular) not being then in existence as an approved religious institute, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> imposed upon them in 1290 the rule of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> (regular) of St. Augustine. From her very childhood, St. Clare gave evidence of the exalted sanctity to which she was one day to attain, and which made her the recipient of so many signal favours from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Upon the death of her older sister in 1295, Clare was chosen to succeed her in the office of <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> of the community at Santa Croce; but it was only in obedience to the command of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> that she could be prevailed upon to accept this new dignity. Kind and indulgent towards others, she treated herself with the most unrelenting severity, multiplying her <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, vigils, and other austerities to such an extent that at one time her life was even feared for. To these acts of penance she added the practice of the most profound <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and the most perfect charity, while the suffering of her Redeemer formed the continual subject of her meditation.

<p>Shortly after the death of St. Clare, inquiry into her <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> wrought through her <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a> was instituted, preparatory to her <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>. It was not, however, until several centuries later that she was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> in 1881.
