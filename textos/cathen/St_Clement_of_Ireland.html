<h1>St. Clement of Ireland</h1>  

<p>Also known as CLEMENS SCOTUS (not to be confounded with Claudius Clemens).

<p>Born in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, towards the middle of the eighth century, died perhaps in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, probably after 818. About the year 771 he set out for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. His biographer, an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of St. Gall, who wrote his Acts, dedicated to Charles the Fat (d. 888), says that St. Clement with his companion Albinus, or Ailbe, arrived in Gaul in 772, and announced himself as a vender of learning. So great was the fame of Clement and Ailbe that Charlemagne sent for them to come to his court, where they stayed for some months. Ailbe was then given the direction of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> near <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, but Clement was requested to remain in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> as the master of a higher <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of learning. These events may have taken place in the winter of the year 774, after <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> had been in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. St. Clement was regent of the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> from 775 until his death. It was not until 782 that <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> became master of the royal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, but even the fame of <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> in no wise diminished the acknowledged reputation of Clement. No serious writer of today thinks of repeating the legend to the effect that St. Clement was founder of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, but, as there is a substratum of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in most legends, the fact remains that this remarkable <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> scholar planted the mustard seed which developed into a great tree of learning at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Many anecdotes are related of St. Clement's life, especially as regards his success as a teacher of youth. Among his pupils were Bruno, Modestus, and Candidus, who had been placed under his care in 803 by Ratgar, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>. When <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> retired to Tours in 796, his post as <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the School of the Palace was naturally given to St. Clement. In 803, as an old man, <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> wrote from his retirement to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, querulously commenting on "the daily increasing influence of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> at the School of the Palace". <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> died 19 May 804, and <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> survived till 28 January 814. St. Clement is probably identical with the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of this name who wrote the biography of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, but the question has not been definitely settled. <a href="../cathen/04099c.htm">Colgan</a> says that he was living in 818, and gives the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of Clement's death as 20 March and the place as Auxerre where he was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the church of Saint-Amator.
