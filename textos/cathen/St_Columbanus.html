<h1>St. Columbanus</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/09467a.htm">Luxeuil</a> and <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a>, born in West Leinster, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, in 543; died at <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 21 November, 615.

<p>His life was written by <a href="../cathen/08498a.htm">Jonas</a>, an <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the Columban community, at <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a>, c. 643. This author lived during the abbacy of <a href="../cathen/02060a.htm">Attala</a>, Columbanus's immediate successor, and his informants had been companions of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> in the second volume of his "Acta Sanctorum O.S.B." gives the life in full, together with an appendix on the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, written by an anonymous member of the Bobbio community.

<p>Columbanus, whose birth took place the year St. Benedict died, was from childhood well instructed. He was handsome and prepossessing in appearance, and this exposed him to the shameless <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> of several of his countrywomen. He also had to struggle with his own <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>. At last he betook himself to a religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who advised him thus:

<blockquote><p>Twelve years ago I fled from the world, and shut myself up in this cell. Hast thou forgotten Samson, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, all led astray by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>? There is no safety for thee, young man, except in flight.</p></blockquote>

<p>He thereupon decided to act on this advice and retire from the world. He encountered opposition, especially from his mother, who strove to detain him by casting herself before him on the threshhold of the door. But, conquering the feelings of natures he passed over the prostrate form and left his home forever. His first master was Sinell <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluaninis in Lough Erne. Under his tuition he composed a commentary on the Psalms. He then betook himself to the celebrated <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Bangor on the coast of Down, which at that time had for its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> <a href="../cathen/04152c.htm">St. Comgall</a>. There he embraced the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> state, and for many years led a life conspicuous for fervour, regularity, and learning. At about the age of forty he seemed to hear incessantly the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> bidding him preach the Gospel in foreign lands. At first his <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> declined to let him go, but at length he gave consent.

<p>Columbanus set sail with twelve companions; their names have thus come down to us: <a href="../cathen/02060a.htm">St. Attala</a>, Columbanus the Younger, Cummain, Domgal, Eogain, <a href="../cathen/01135c.htm">Eunan</a>, St. Gall, Gurgano, Libran, Lua, Sigisbert and Waldoleno (Strokes, "Apennines", p. 112). The little band passed over to Britain, landing probably on the Scottish coast. They remained but a short time in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and then crossed over to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where they arrived probably in 585. At once they began their apostolic mission. Wherever they went the people, were struck by their modesty, patience, and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> at that period needed such a band of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and preachers. Owing partly to the incursions of barbarians, and partly due to the remissness of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, vice and impiety were prevalent. Columbanus, by his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and learning, was eminently fitted for the work that lay before him. He and his followers soon made their way to the court of Gontram, King of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. Jonas calls it the court of Sigisbert, King of Austrasia and <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, but this is manifestly a blunder, for Sigisbert had been slain in 575. The fame of Columbanus had preceded him. Gontram gave him a gracious reception, inviting him to remain in his kingdom. The saint complied, and selected for his abode the half-ruined Roman fortress of Annegray in the solitudes of the Vosges Mountains. Here the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> led the simplest of lives, their food oftentimes consisting of nothing but forest herbs, berries, and the bark of young trees. The fame of Columbanus's <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> drew crowds to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Many, both nobles and rustics, asked to be admitted into the community. Sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> came to be cured through their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. But Columbanus <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> solitude. Often he would withdrew to a cave seven miles distant, with a single companion, who acted as messenger between himself and his brethren. After a few years the ever-increasing number of his disciples <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">oblige</a> him to build another <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Columbanus accordingly obtained from King Gontram the Gallo-Roman castle named Luxeuil, some eight miles distant from Annegray. It was in a wild district, thickly covered with pine forests and brushwood. This foundation of the celebrated Abbey of Luxueil, took place in 590. But these two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> did not suffice for the numbers who came, and a third had to be erected at Fontaines. The superiors of these houses always remained subordinate to Columbanus. It is said this time, he was able to institute a perpetual service of praise, known as <em>Laus perennis</em>, by which choir succeeded choir, both day and night (Montalembert, Monks of the West II, 405). For these flourishing communities he wrote his rule, which embodies the customs of Bangor and other Celtic <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>.

<p>For wellnigh twenty years Columbanus resided in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and during that time observed the unreformed paschal computation. But a dispute arose. The <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were not too well disposed towards this stranger <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, because of his ever-increasing influence, and at last they showed their hostility. They objected to his Celtic <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> and his exclusion of men as well as <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> from the precincts of his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. The councils of Gaul held in the first half of the sixth century had given to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> absolute authority over <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, even going so far as to order the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> to appear periodically before their respective <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to receive reproof or advice, as might be considered <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. These enactments, being contrary to the custom of the Celtic <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, were readily accepted by Columbanus. In 602 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled to judge him. He did not appear, lest, as he tells us, "he might contend in words", but instead addressed a letter to the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> in which he speaks with a strange mixture of freedom, reverence, and charity. In it he admonishes them to hold <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> more frequently, and advises that they pay attention to matters equally important with that of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. As to his paschal cycle he says: "I am not the author of this divergence. I came as a poor stranger into these parts for the cause of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ, Our Saviour</a>. One thing alone I ask of you, holy Fathers, permit me to live in silence in these forests, near the bones of seventeen of my brethren now dead." When the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> still insisted that the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was wrong, then, in obedience to <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick's</a> canon, he laid the question before <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope St. Gregory</a>. He dispatched two letters to that pontiff, but they never reached him, "through <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan's</a> intervention". The third letter is extant, but no trace of an answer appears in <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory's</a> correspondence, owing probably to the fact that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> died in 604, about the time it reached <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In this letter he defends the Celtic custom with considerable freedom, but the tone is affectionate. He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> "the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Pope, his Father", to direct towards him "the strong support of his authority, to transmit the verdict of his favour". Moreover, he apologizes "for presuming to argue as it were, with him who sits in the chair of Peter, Apostle and Bearer of the Keys". He directed another epistle to <a href="../cathen/02660c.htm">Pope Boniface IV</a>, in which he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> that, if it be not contrary to the Faith, he confirm the tradition of his elders, so that by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> decision (<em>judicium</em>) he and his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> may be enabled to follow the rites of their ancestors. Before Pope Bonifice's answer (which has been lost) was given, Columbanus was outside the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. As we hear no further accusation on the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> question &#151; not even in those brought against his successor, Eustasius of Luxeuil in 624 &#151; it would appear that after Columbanus had removed into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> he gave up the Celtic <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> (cf. Acta SS. O.S.B., II, p. 7).



<p>In addition to the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> question Columbanus had to wage <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against vice in the royal household. The young King Thierry, to whose kingdom Luxeuil belonged, was living a life of debauchery. He was completely in the hands of his grandmother, Queen Brunehault (Brunehild). On the death of King Gontram the succession passed to his nephew, Childebert II, son of Brunehault. At his death the latter left two sons, Theodebert II and Thierry II, both minors. Theodebert succeeded to Austrasia, Thierry to <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, but Brunehault constituted herself their guardian, and held in her own power the governments of the two kingdoms. As she advanced in years she sacrificed everything to the passion of sovereignty, hence she encouraged Thierry in the practice <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a> in order that there might be no rival queen. Thierry, however, had a veneration for Columbanus, and often visited him. On these occasions the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> admonished and rebuked him, but in vain. Brunehault became enraged with Columbanus, stirred up the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and nobles to find fault with his rules regarding <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">monastic enclosure</a>. Finally, Thierry and his party went to Luxeuil and ordered the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> to conform to the usages of the country. Columbanus refused, whereupon he was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> to <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a> to await further orders. Taking advantage of the absence of restraint he speedily returned to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. On hearing this, Thierry and Brunehault sent soldiers to drive him back to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. None but <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were to accompany him. Accordingly, he was hurried to <a href="../cathen/10778a.htm">Nevers</a>, made to embark on the Loire, and thus proceed to <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>. At Tours he visited the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Martin and sent a message to Thierry that within three years he and his children would perish. At <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, before the embarkation, he addressed a letter to his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, full of affection. It is a memorial of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and tenderness which existed in that otherwise austere and passionate <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. In it he desires all to obey Attala, whom he requests to abide with the community unless strife should arise on the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> question. His letter concludes thus "They come to tell me the ship is ready. The end of my parchment compels me to finish my letter. Love is not orderly; it is this which has made it confused. Farewell, dear hearts of mine; <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for me that I may live in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." As soon as they set sail, such a storm arose that ship was driven ashore. The captain would have nothing more to do with these holy men; they were thus free to go where they pleased. Columbanus made his way to the friendly King Clothaire at <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a> in Neustria where he was gladly welcomed. Clothaire in vain pressed him to remain in his territory. Columbanus left Neustria in 611 for the court of King Theodebert of Austrasia. At Metz he received an honourable welcome, and then proceeding to <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, he embarked upon the Rhine in order to reach the Suevi and Alamanni, to whom he wished to preach the Gospel. Ascending the river and its tributaries, the Aar and the Limmat, he came to the Lake of <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a>. Tuggen was chosen as a centre from which to evangelize, but the work was not successful. Instead of producing fruit, the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Columbanus only excited <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. In despair he resolved to pass on by way of Arbon to Bregenz on Lake Constance, where there were still some traces of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Here the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> found an oratory dedicated to St. Aurelia, into which the people had brought three brass images of their tutelary <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a>. He commanded St. Gall, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the language, to preach to the inhabitants, and many were converted. The images were destroyed, and Columbanus blessed the little church, placing the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Aurelia beneath the altar. A <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was erected, and the brethren forthwith observed their regular life. After about a year, in consequence of another rising against the community, Columbanus resolved to cross the Alps into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. An additional reason for his departure was the fact that the arms of Thierry had prevailed against Theodebert, and thus the country on the banks of the Upper Rhine had become the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of his enemy.

<p>On his arrival at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> in 612, Columbanus met with a kindly welcome from King Agilulf and Queen Theodelinda. He immediately began to confute the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and wrote a treatise against their teaching, which has been lost. At the request of the king, he wrote a letter to <a href="../cathen/02660c.htm">Pope Boniface</a> on the debated subject of <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">"The Three Chapters"</a>. These writings were considered to favour <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope St. Gregory</a>, however, tolerated in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who defended them, among whom was King Agilulf. Columbanus would probably have taken no active part in this matter had not the king pressed him so to do. But on this occasion his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> certainly outran his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. The letter opens with all apology that a "foolish Scot" should be charged to write for a Lombard king. He acquaints the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with the imputations brought against him, and he is particularly severe with the memory of <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Pope Vigilius</a>. He entreats the pontiff to prove his <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> and assemble a council. He says that his freedom of speech accords with the usage of his country. "Doubtless", <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a> remarks, "some of the expressions which he employs should be now regarded as disrespectful and justly rejected But in those young and vigorous times, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and austerity could be more indulgent" (II, 440). On the other hand, the letter expresses the most affectionate and impassioned devotion to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The whole, however, may be judged from this fragment: "We <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, though dwelling at the far ends of the earth, are all disciples of St. Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> . . . Neither <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> has ever been among us; but the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, Just as it was first delivered to us by yourselves, the successors of the Apostles, is held by us unchanged . . . we are bound [<em>devincti</em>] to the Chair of Peter, and although <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is great and renowned, through that Chair alone is she looked on as great and illustrious among us . . .On account of the two Apostles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, you [the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>] are almost celestial, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is the head of the whole world, and of the Churches". If <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to overstep the limits of discretion, his real attitude towards <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is sufficiently clear. He declares the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to be: "his Lord and Father in Christ", "The Chosen Watchman", "The Prelate most dear to all the Faithful", "The most beautiful Head of all the Churches of the whole of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>", "Pastor of Pastors", "The Highest", "The First", "The First Pastor, set higher than all mortals", "Raised near into all the Celestial Beings", "Prince of the Leaders", "His Father", "His immediate Patron", "The Steersman", "The Pilot of the Spiritual Ship" (Allnatt, "Cathedra Petri", 106).

<p>But it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that, in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Columbanus should have a settled abode, so the king gave him a tract of land called Bobbio, between <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, near the River Trebbia, situated in a defile of the Apennines. On his way thither he taught the Faith in the town of Mombrione, which is called San Colombano to this day. Padre della Torre considers that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> made two journeys into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and that these have been confounded by Jonas. On the first occasion he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and received from <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope Gregory</a> many <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">sacred relics</a> (Stokes, Apennines, 132). This may possibly explain the traditional spot in St. Peter's, where <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> and St. Columba are supposed to have met (Moran, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> SS. in Great Britain,105). At Bobbio the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> repaired the half-ruined <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter, and erected his celebrated <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, which for centuries was stronghold of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> in Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Thither came Clothaire's messengers inviting the aged <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> to return, now that his enemies were dead. But he could not go. He sent a request that the king would always protect his dear <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> at <a href="../cathen/09467a.htm">Luxeuil</a>. He prepared for death by retiring to his cave on the mountain-side overlooking the Trebbia, where, according to a tradition, he had dedicated an oratory to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> (Montalembert, "Monks of the West", II, 444). His body has been preserved in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church at <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a>, and many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are said to have been wrought there through his intercession. In 1482 the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were placed in a new shrine and laid beneath the altar of the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a>, where they are still <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>. But the altar and shrine are once more to be restored, and for this end in 1907 all appeal was made by Cardinal Logue, and there is every prospect of the work being speedily accomplished. The <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> at <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a> possesses a portion of the skull of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, his knife, wooden cup, bell, and an ancient water vessel, formerly containing <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">sacred relics</a> and said to have been given him by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>. According to certain authorities, twelve teeth of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> were taken from the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> in the fifteenth century and kept in the treasury, but these have now disappeared (Stokes, Apennines, p. 183). St. Columbanus is named in the Roman Martyrology on 21 November, but his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept by the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> and throughout <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> on 24 November. Among his principal <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are: (1) procuring of food for a sick <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and curing the wife of his benefactor; (2) escape from hurt when surrounded by wolves; (3) obedience of a bear which evacuated a cave at his biddings; (4) producing a spring of water near his cave; (5) repletion of the Luxeuil granary when empty; (6) multiplication of bread and beer for his community; (7) curing of the sick <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, who rose from their beds at his request to reap the harvest; (8) giving sight to a blind man at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>; (9) destruction by his breath of a cauldron of beer prepared for a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> festival; (10) taming a bear, and yoking it to a plough.

<p>Like other men, Columbanus was not faultless. In the cause of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> he was impetuous and even head-strong, for by nature he was eager, passionate, and dauntless. These qualities were both the source of his power and the cause of mistakes. But his virtues were very remarkable. He shared with other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> a great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> creatures. As he walked in the woods, the birds would alight upon his shoulder that he might caress them and the squirrels would run down from the trees and nestle in the folds of his cowl. The fascination of his saintly <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> drew numerous communities around him. That he possessed real affection for others is abundantly manifest in his letter to his brethren. Archbishop Healy eulogises him thus: "A man more holy, more chaste, more self-denying, a man with loftier aims and purer heart than Columbanus was never born in the Island of Saints" (Ireland's Ancient Schools, 378). Regarding his attitude towards the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, although with Celtic warmth and flow of words he could defend mere custom, there is nothing in his strongest expressions which implies that, in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, he for a moment <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> Rome's supreme authority. His influence in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> was due to the conversions he effected and to the rule that he composed. What gave rise to his apostolate? Possibly the restless energy of the Celtic character, which, not finding sufficient scope in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, directed itself in the cause of Christ to foreign lands. It may be that the example and success of St. Columba in Caledonia stimulated him to similar exertions. The example, however, of Columbanus in the sixth century stands out as the prototype of missionary enterprise towards the countries of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, so eagerly follows up from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> by such men as Killian, Virgilius, Donatus, Wilfrid, Willibrord, Swithbert, and <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a>. If Columbanus <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> became a citadel of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and learning, Luxeuil in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> became the nursery of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and apostles. From its walls went forth men who carried his rule, together with the Gospel, into <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. There are said to have been sixty-three such apostles (Stokes, Forests of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 254). These disciples of Columbanus are accredited with founding over one hundred different <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> (ib., 74). The canton and town still bearing the name of St. Gall testify how well one disciple succeeded.

<p>Columbanus has left us his own writings. They demonstrate that his attainments were of no mean order. He continued his literary studies till the very eve of his death. His works (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> P.L. LXXX) include: (1) "Penitencial" which prescribes penances according to guilt, a useful guide in the absence of elaborate treatises on <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>; (2) "Seventeen short Sermons"; (3) "Six Epistles"; (4) "Latin Poems"; (5) "A Monastic Rule". This Last is much shorter than that of St. Benedict, consisting of only ten chapters. The first six of these treat of obedience, silence, food, poverty, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, and chastity. In these there is much in common with the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> code, except that the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is more rigorous. Chapter vii deals with the choir Offices. Sunday Martins in winter consisted of sevent-five psalms and twenty-five antiphone--three psalms to each antiphone. In spring and autumn these were reduced to thirty-six, and in summer to twenty-four, Fewer were said on week days. The day hours consisted of <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">Terce</a>, Sext, None, and <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>. Three psalms were said at each of these Offices, except <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, when twelve psalms were said. Chapter x regulates penances for offences, and it is here that the Rule of St. Columbanus differs so widely from that of St. Benedict. Stripes or <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> were enjoined for the smallest faults. The habit of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> consisted of a tunic of undyed wool, over which was worn the <em>cuculla</em>, or cowl, of the same material. A great deal of time was devoted to various kinds of manual labour. The Rule of St. Columbanus was approved of by the Council of <a href="../cathen/09507a.htm">M&acirc;con</a> in 627, but it was destined before the close of the century to be superseded by that of St. Benedict. For several centuries in some of the greater <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> the two rules were observed conjointly. In art St. Columbanus is represented <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">bearded</a> bearing the monastic cowl, he holds in his hand a book with an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> satchel, and stands in the midst of wolves. Sometimes he is depicted in the attitude of taming a bear, or with sunbeams over his head (Husenheth, "Emblems", p. 33).
