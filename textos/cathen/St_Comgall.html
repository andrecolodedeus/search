<h1>St. Comgall</h1>  

<p>Founder and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the great <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Bangor, flourished in the sixth century. The year of his birth is uncertain, but according to the testimony of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> annals it must be placed between 510 and 520; his death is said to have occurred in 602 ("Annals of Tighernach" and "Chronicon Scotorum"), or 597 (Annals of Innisfallen). He was born in Dalaradia in Ulster near the place now known as Magheramorne in the present County Antrim. He seems to have served first as a soldier, and on his release from military service he is said to have studied at <a href="../cathen/04064a.htm">Clonard</a> with St. Finnian, and at <a href="../cathen/04065a.htm">Clonmacnoise</a> with St. Ciaran, who died in 549. We next find him in Ulster in an island on Lough Erne accompanied by a few friends following a very severe form of monastic life. He intended to go to Britain, but was dissuaded from this step by Lugidius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> him, at whose advice he remained in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and set himself to spread the monastic life throughout the country. The most famous of the Comgall is Bangor, situated in the present County Down, on the Southern shore of Belfast Lough and directly opposite to Carrickfergus. According to the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> annals Bangor was founded not later than 552, though Ussher and most of the later writers on the subject assign the foundation to the year 555. According to <a href="../cathen/01135c.htm">Adamnan's</a> "Life of Columba", there was a very close connection between Comgall and Columba though there does not appear to be sufficient authority for stating that Comgall was the disciple of Columba in any strict sense. He is said to have been the friend of <a href="../cathen/02758c.htm">St. Brendan</a>, St. Cormac, St. Cainnech, and Finbarr of Moville. After intense suffering he received the Eucharist from St. Fiacra and expired in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Bangor.

<p>Comgall belonged to what is known as the Second Order of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Saints. These flourished in the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church during the sixth century. They were for the most part <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in Britain, or received their training from those who had grown up under the influence of the British Schools. They were the founders of the great <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and contributed much to the spread of monasticism in the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church. It is an interesting question how far Comgall, or men like him, had advanced in their establishments at Bangor and elsewhere in introducing the last stages of monasticism then developed on the Continent by St. Benedict. In other words, did St. Congall give his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> at Bangor a strict monastic rule resembling the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>? There has come down to us a Rule of St. Comgall in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, but the evidence would not warrant us in saying that as it stands at present it could be attributed to him. The fact, however, that Columbanus, a disciple of Comgall and himself a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Bangor, drew up for his Continental <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> a "Regula Monachorum" wound lead us to believe that there had been a similar organization in Bangor in his time. This, however, is not conclusive, since Columbanus might have derived inspiration from the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Benedictine Rule</a> then widely spread over South-Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. St. Comgall is mentioned in the "Life of Columbanus" by Jonas, as the superior of Bangor, under whom St. Columbanus had studied. He is also mentioned under 10 May, his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast-day</a> in the "Felire" of Oengus the Culdee published by Whitley Stokes for the Henry Bradshaw Society (2nd ed.), and his name is commemorated in the Stowe <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> (MacCarthy), and in the Martyrology of Tallaght.
