<h1>St. Conrad of Piacenza</h1>  

<p>Hermit of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth uncertain; died at <a href="../cathen/11126a.htm">Noto</a> in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, 19 February, 1351. He belonged to one of the noblest <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, and having married when he was quite young, led a virtuous and God-fearing life. On one occasion, when he was engaged in his usual pastime of hunting, he ordered his attendants to fire some brushwood in which game had taken refuge. The prevailing wind caused the flames to spread rapidly, and the surrounding fields and forest were soon in a state of conflagration. A <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant</a>, who happened to be found near the place where the fire had originated, was accused of being the author. He was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, tried, and condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>. As the poor man was being led to execution, Conrad, stricken with remorse, made open confession of his guilt; and in order to repair the damage of which he had been the cause, was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to sell all his possessions. Thus reduced to poverty, Conrad retired to a lonely hermitage some distance from <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, while his wife entered the Order of <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>. Later he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and thence to <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, where for thirty years he lived a most austere and penitential life and worked numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. He is especially invoked for the cure of hernia. In 1515 <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> permitted the town of <a href="../cathen/11126a.htm">Noto</a> to celebrate his feast, which permission was later extended by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> to the whole Order of St. Francis. Though bearing the title of saint, Conrad was never formally <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> on 19 February.
