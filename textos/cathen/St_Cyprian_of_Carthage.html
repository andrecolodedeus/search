<h1>St. Cyprian of Carthage</h1>  

<p>(Thaschus C&aelig;cilius Cyprianus).

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. Of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> birth and of his early life nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. At the time of his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> he had, perhaps, passed middle life. He was famous as an orator and pleader, had considerable wealth, and held, no doubt, a great position in the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of Africa. We learn from his <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, St. Pontius, whose life of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> is preserved, that his mien was dignified without severity, and cheerful without effusiveness. His gift of eloquence is evident in his writings. He was not a thinker, a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, but eminently a man of the world and an administrator, of vast energies, and of forcible and striking character. His conversion was due to an aged <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> named Caecilianus, with whom he seems to have gone to live. Caecilianus in dying commended to Cyprian the care of his wife and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. While yet a <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a> the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> decided to observe chastity, and he gave most of his revenues to the poor. He sold his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, including his gardens at Carthage. These were restored to him (<em>Dei indulgenti&acirc; restituti</em>, says Pontius), being apparently bought back for him by his friends; but he would have sold them again, had the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> made this imprudent. His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> probably took place c. 246, presumably on <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Easter eve</a>, 18 April.

<p>Cyprian's first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writing is "Ad Donatum", a monologue spoken to a friend, sitting under a vine-clad pergola. He tells how, until the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace of God</a> illuminated and strengthened the convert, it had seemed impossible to conquer vice; the decay of Roman <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> is pictured, the gladiatorial shows, the theatre, the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> law-courts, the hollowness of political success; the only refuge is the temperate, studious, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayerful</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. At the beginning should probably be placed the few words of Donatus to Cyprian which are printed by Hartel as a spurious letter. The style of this pamphlet is affected and reminds us of the bombastic unintelligibility of Pontius. It is not like <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, brilliant, barbarous, uncouth, but it reflects the preciosity which Apuleius made fashionable in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. In his other works Cyprian addresses a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> audience; his own fervour is allowed full play, his style becomes simpler, though forcible, and sometimes poetical, not to say flowery. Without being classical, it is correct for its date, and the cadences of the sentences are in strict rhythm in all his more careful writings. On the whole his beauty of style has rarely been equalled among the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, and never surpassed except by the matchless energy and wit of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>.

<p>Another work of his early days was the "Testimonia ad Quirinum", in two books. It consists of passages of Scripture arranged under headings to illustrate the passing away of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> and its fulfillment in Christ. A third book, added later, contains texts dealing with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ethics. This work is of the greatest value for the history of the Old Latin version of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. It gives us an African text closely related to that of the Bobbio <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> known as <em>k</em> (Turin). Hartel's edition has taken the text from a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> which exhibits a revised version, but what Cyprian wrote can be fairly well restored from the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> cited in Hartel's notes as L. Another book of excerpts on <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is entitled "Ad Fortunatum"; its text cannot be judged in any printed edition. Cyprian was certainly only a recent convert when he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> c. 218 or the beginning of 249, but he passed through all the grades of the ministry. He had declined the charge, but was constrained by the people. A minority opposed his election, including five <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who remained his enemies; but he tells us that he was validly elected "after the Divine judgment, the vote of the people and the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>".
<h2>The Decian persecution</h2>

<p>The prosperity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> during a peace of thirty-eight years had produced great disorders. Many even of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were given up to worldliness and gain, and we hear of worse <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a>. In October, 249, <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a> became emperor with the <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> of restoring the ancient virtue of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In January, 250, he published an edict against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Bishops were to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to be punished and tortured till they recanted. On 20 January Pope Fabian was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a>, and about the same time St. Cyprian retired to a safe place of hiding. His enemies continually reproached him with this. But to remain at Carthage was to court death, to cause greater danger to others, and to leave the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> without government; for to elect a new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> would have been as impossible as it was at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He made over much <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to a confessor <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Rogatian, for the needy. Some of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> lapsed, others fled; Cyprian suspended their pay, for their ministrations were needed and they were in less danger than the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Form his retreat he encouraged the confessors and wrote eloquent panegyrics on the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Fifteen soon died in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and one in the mines. On the arrival of the proconsul in April the severity of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> increased. St. Mappalicus died gloriously on the 17th. Children were tortured, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> dishonoured. Numidicus, who had encouraged many, saw his wife burnt to alive, and was himself half burnt, then stoned and left for dead; his daughter found him yet living; he recovered and Cyprian made him a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Some, after being twice tortured, were dismissed or banished, often beggared.



<p>But there was another side to the picture. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> terrified <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> rushed to the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> to sacrifice. At Carthage the majority <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a>. Some would not sacrifice, but purchased <em>libelli</em>, or certificates, that they had done so Some bought the exemption of their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> at the price of their own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Of these <em>libellatici</em> there were several thousands in <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>. Of the fallen some did not repent, others joined the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, but most of them clamoured for forgiveness and restoration. Some, who had sacrificed under torture, returned to be tortured afresh. Castus and &AElig;milius were burnt for recanting, others were exiled; but such cases were necessarily rare. A few began to perform canonical penance. The first to suffer at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> had been a young Carthaginian, Celerinus. He recovered, and Cyprian made him a <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a>. His grandmother and two uncles had been <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, but his two sisters <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a> under fear of torture, and in their repentance gave themselves to the service of those in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. Their brother was very urgent for their restoration. His letter from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to Lucian, a confessor at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, is extant, with the reply of the latter. Lucian obtained from a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> named Paul before his passion a commission to grant peace to any who asked for it, and he distributed these "indulgences" with a vague formula: "Let such a one with his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> communicate". <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> speaks in 197 of the "custom" for those who were not at peace with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to beg this peace from the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Much later, in his <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanist</a> days (c. 220) he urges that the adulterers whom Pope Callistus was ready to forgive after due penance, would now get restored by merely imploring the confessors and those in the mines. Correspondingly we find Lucian issuing pardons in the name of confessors who were still alive, a manifest abuse. The heroic Mappalicus had only interceded for his own sister and mother. It seemed now as if no penance was to be enforced upon the lapsed, and Cyprian wrote to remonstrate.

<p>Meanwhile official news had arrived from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> of the death of Pope Fabian, together with an unsigned and ungrammatical letter to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Carthage from some of the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, implying blame to Cyprian for the desertion of his flock, and giving advice as to the treatment of the lapsed. Cyprian explained his conduct (Ep. xx), and sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> copies of thirteen of the letter he had written from his hiding-place to Carthage. The five <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who opposed him were now admitting at once to communion all who had recommendations from the confessors, and the confessors themselves issued a general indulgence, in accordance with which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were to restore to communion all whom they had examined. This was an outrage on discipline, yet Cyprian was ready to give some value to the indulgences thus improperly granted, but all must be done in submission to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He proposed that <em>libellatici</em> should be restored, when in danger of death, by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or even by a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, but that the rest should await the cessation of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, when councils could be held at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, and a common decision be agreed upon. Some regard must be had for the prerogative of the confessors, yet the lapsed must surely not be placed in a better position than those who had stood fast, and had been tortured, or beggared, or exiled. The guilty were terrified by marvels that occurred. A man was struck dumb on the very Capitol where he had denied Christ. Another went mad in the public baths, and gnawed the tongue which had tasted the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> victim. In Cyprian's own presence an infant who had been taken by its nurse to partake at the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> altar, and then to the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> offered by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was though in torture, and vomited the Sacred Species it had received in the holy <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>. A lapsed <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of advanced age had fallen in a fit, on venturing to communicate unworthily. Another, on opening the receptacle in which, according to custom, she had taken home the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> for private Communion, was deterred from <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegiously</a> touching it by fire which came forth. Yet another found nought within her <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a> save cinders. About September, Cyprian received promise of support from the Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in two letters written by the famous <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> in the name of his colleagues. In the beginning of 251 the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> waned, owing to the successive appearance of two rival emperors. The confessors were released, and a council was convened at Carthage. By the perfidy of some <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> Cyprian was unable to leave his retreat till after <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> (23 March). But he wrote a letter to his flock denouncing the most <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> of the five <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, Novatus, and his <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> <a href="../cathen/06027c.htm">Felicissimus</a> (Ep. xliii). To the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> order to delay the reconciliation of the lapsed until the council, <a href="../cathen/06027c.htm">Felicissimus</a> had replied by a manifesto, declaring that none should communicate with himself who accepted the large <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> distributed by Cyprian's order. The subject of the letter is more fully developed in the treatise "De Ecclesiae Catholicae Unitate" which Cyprian wrote about this time (Benson wrongly thought it was written against <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> some weeks later).

<p>This celebrated pamphlet was read by its author to the council which met in April, that he might get the support of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> against the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> started by <a href="../cathen/06027c.htm">Felicissimus</a> and Novatus, who had a large following. The unity with which St. Cyprian deals is not so much the unity of the whole Church, the necessity of which he rather postulates, as the unity to be kept in each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> by union with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; the unity of the whole Church is maintained by the close union of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who are "glued to one another", hence whosoever is not with his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is cut off from the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a> and cannot be united to Christ; the type of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is St. Peter, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> controversialists have attributed to St. Cyprian the absurd argument that Christ said to Peter what He really meant for all, in order to give a type or picture of unity. What St. Cyprian really says is simply this, that Christ, using the metaphor of an edifice, founds His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on a single foundation which shall manifest and ensure its unity. And as Peter is the foundation, binding the whole Church together, so in each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. With this one argument Cyprian claims to cut at the root of all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a>. It has been a mistake to find any reference to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in this passage (<a href="../fathers/050701.htm"><em>Treatise on Unity</em> 4</a>).
<h2>Church unity</h2>

<p>About the time of the opening of the council (251), two letters arrived from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. One of these, announcing the election of a pope, <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">St. Cornelius</a>, was read by Cyprian to the assembly; the other contained such violent and improbable accusations against the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> that he thought it better to pass it over. But two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Caldonius and Fortunatus, were dispatched to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for further information, and the whole council was to await their return-such was the importance of a papal election. Meantime another message arrived with the news that <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>, the most eminent among the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, had been made <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Happily two African <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, Pompeius and Stephanus, who had been present at the election of <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a>, arrived also, and were able to testify that he had been validly set "in the place of Peter", when as yet there was no other claimant. It was thus possible to reply to the recrimination of Novatian's envoys, and a short letter was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, explaining the discussion which had taken place in the council. Soon afterwards came the report of Caldonius and Fortunatus together with a letter from <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a>, in which the latter complained somewhat of the delay in recognizing him. Cyprian wrote to <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a> explaining his prudent conduct. He added a letter to the confessors who were the main support of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, leaving it to <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a> whether it should be delivered or no. He sent also copies of his two treatises, "De Unitate" and <a href="../fathers/050703.htm">"De Lapsis"</a> (this had been composed by him immediately after the other), and he wishes the confessors to read these in order that they may understand what a fearful thing is <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. It is in this copy of the "De Unitate" that Cyprian appears most probably to have added in the margin an alternative version of the fourth chapter. The original passage, as found in most <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and as printed in Hartel's edition, runs thus: <blockquote> If any will consider this, there is no need of a long treatise and of arguments. 'The Lord saith to Peter: 'I say unto thee that thou art <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, and upon this rock I will build My Church, and the gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> shall not prevail against it; to thee I will give the keys to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, and what thou shalt have bound on earth shall be bound in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and what thou shalt have loosed shall be loosed in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.' Upon one He builds His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and though to all His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> He gives an equal power and says: 'As My Father hath sent Me, even so send I you: Receive the Holy Ghost, whosesoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall have remitted they shall be remitted unto them, and whosesoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall have retained they shall be retained', yet that He might make unity manifest, He disposed the origin of that unity beginning from one. The other Apostles were indeed what Peter was, endowed with a like fellowship both of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and of power, but the commencement proceeds from one, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may be shown to be one. This one Church the Holy Ghost in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Lord designates in the Canticle of Canticles, and says, One is My Dove, My perfect one, one is she to her mother, one to her that bare her. He that holds not this <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a>, does he believe that he holds the Faith? He who strives against and resists the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is he confident that he is in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? </blockquote>

<p>The substituted passage is as follows: <blockquote> . . . bound in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Upon one He builds His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <em>and to the same He says after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, 'feed My sheep'.</em> And though to all His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> He gave an equal power <em>yet did He set up one chair</em>, and disposed the origin <em>and manner</em> of unity by his authority. The other Apostles were indeed what Peter was, <em>but the primacy is given to Peter, and</em> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <em>and the chair</em> is shown to be one. <em>And all are <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, but the flock is shown to be one, which is fed by all the Apostles with one mind and heart.</em> He that holds not this <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a>, does he think that he holds the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? He who <em>deserts the chair of Peter, upon whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is founded</em>, is he confident that he is in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? </blockquote>

<p>These alternative versions are given one after the other in the chief <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> which contains them, while in some other <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> the two have been partially or wholly combined into one. The combined version is the one which has been printed in man editions, and has played a large part in controversy with <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. It is of course spurious in this conflated form, but the alternative form given above is not only found in eighth- and ninth-century <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, but it is quoted by <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> (in a letter written for his predecessor <a href="../cathen/11603a.htm">Pelagius II</a>), and by St. Gelasius; indeed, it was almost certainly known to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> and <a href="../cathen/11262b.htm">St. Optatus</a> in the fourth century. The evidence of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> would indicate an equally early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. Every expression and thought in the passage can be paralleled from St. Cyprian's habitual language, and it seems to be now generally admitted that this alternative passage is an alteration made by the author himself when forwarding his work to the Roman confessors. The "one chair" is always in Cyprian the episcopal chair, and Cyprian has been careful to emphasize this point, and to add a reference to the other great Petrine text, the Charge in <a href="../bible/joh021.htm">John 21</a>. The assertion of the equality of the Apostles as Apostles remains, and the omissions are only for the sake of brevity. The old contention that it is a Roman <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> is at all events quite out of the question. Another passage is also altered in all the same <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> which contain the "interpolation"; it is a paragraph in which the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> conduct of the lapsed "on this hand (<em>hic</em>) is contrasted in a long succession of parallels with the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and wickedness of the schismatics "on that hand" (<em>illic</em>), but in the delicate manner of the treatise the latter are only referred to in a general way. In the "interpolated" <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> we find that the lapsed, whose caused had now been settled by the council, are "on that hand" (<em>illic</em>), whereas the reference to the schismatics &#151; meaning the Roman confessors who were supporting <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>, and to whom the book was being sent &#151; are made as pointed as possible, being brought into the foreground by the repeated hic, "on this hand".
<h2>Novatianism</h2>

<p>The saint's remonstrance had its effect, and the confessors rallied to <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a>. But for two or three months the confusion throughout the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had been terrible. No other event in these early times shows us so clearly the enormous importance of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> in East and West. <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">St. Dionysius of Alexandria</a> joined his great influence to that of the Carthaginian <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>, and he was very soon able to write that Antioch, <a href="../cathen/03133b.htm">Caesarea</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and Laodicea, all Cilicia and Cappadocia, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Arabia, Mesopotamia, <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, and Bithynia, had returned to union and that their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were all in concord (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.5</a>). From this we gauge the area of disturbance. Cyprian says that <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> "assumed the primacy" (Ep. lxix, 8) and sent out his new apostles to very many cities; and where in all provinces and cities there were long established, <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, tried in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, he dared to create new ones to supplant them, as though he could range through the whole world (Ep. lv, 24). Such was the power assumed by a third-century <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>. Let it be remembered that in the first days of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> no question of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was raised and that <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> only enunciated his refusal of forgiveness to the lapsed after he had made himself <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Cyprian's reasons for holding <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> are fully detailed in Ep. lv to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who had at first yielded to Cyprian's arguments and had commissioned him to inform <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a> that "he now communicated with him, that is with the Catholic <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>", but had afterwards wavered. It is evidently implied that if he did not communicate with <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a> he would be outside the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Writing to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, Cyprian apologizes for his delay in acknowledging him; he had at least urged all those who sailed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to make sure that they acknowledged and held the womb and root of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (Ep. xlviii, 3). By this is probably meant "the womb and root which is the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>", but Harnack and many <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, as well as many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, find here a statement that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> is the womb and root. Cyprian continues that he had waited for a formal report form the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had been sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, before committing all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Africa, Numidia, and Mauretania to a decision, in order that, when no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> could remain all his colleagues "might firmly approve and hold your communion, that is the unity and charity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>". It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that St. Cyprian held that one who was in communion with an <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> held not the root of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, was not nourished at her breast, drank not at her fountain.

<p>So little was the rigorism of <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> the origin of his <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, that his chief partisan was no other than Novatus, who at Carthage had been reconciling the lapsed indiscriminately without penance. He seems to have arrived at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> just after the election of <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a>, and his adhesion to the party of rigorism had the curious result of destroying the opposition to Cyprian at Carthage. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/06027c.htm">Felicissimus</a> fought manfully for a time; he even procured five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, all <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and deposed, who <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> for the party a certain Fortunatus in opposition to St. Cyprian, in opposition to St. Cyprian, in order not to be outdone by the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> party, who had already a rival <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at Carthage. The faction even appealed to <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">St. Cornelius</a>, and Cyprian had to write to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a long account of the circumstances, ridiculing their presumption in "sailing to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> Church (<em>ecclesia principalis</em>), the Chair of Peter, whence the unity of the Episcopate had its origin, not recollecting that these are the Romans whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was praised by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#vrs8">Romans 1:8</a>), to whom unfaith could have no access". But this embassy was naturally unsuccessful, and the party of Fortunatus and <a href="../cathen/06027c.htm">Felicissimus</a> seems to have melted away.
<h2>The lapsed</h2>

<p>With regard to the lapsed the council had decided that each case must be judged on its merits, and that <em>libellatici</em> should be restored after varying, but lengthy, terms of penance, whereas those who had actually sacrificed might after life-long penance receive Communion in the hour of death. But any one who put off sorrow and penance until the hour of sickness must be refused all Communion. The decision was a severe one. A recrudescence of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, announced, Cyprian tells us, by numerous visions, caused the assembling of another council in the summer of 252 (so Benson and Nelke, but Ritsch and Harnack prefer 253), in which it was decided to restore at once all those who were doing penance, in order that they might be fortified by the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> against trial. In this <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Gallus and Volusianus, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was again tried, but this time Cyprian was able to congratulate the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on the firmness shown; the whole Church of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he says, had confessed unanimously, and once again its <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, praised by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a>, was celebrated throughout the whole world (Ep. lx). About June 253, <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a> was exiled to Centumcellae (Civitavecchia), and died there, being counted as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> by Cyprian and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. His successor Lucius was at once sent to the same place on his election, but soon was allowed to return, and Cyprian wrote to congratulate him. He died 5 March, 254, and was succeeded by Stephen, 12 May, 254.
<h2>Rebaptism of heretics</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> had characteristically argued long before, that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have not the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the same Christ with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, therefore their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is null. The African Church had adopted this view in a council held under a predecessor of Cyprian, <a href="../cathen/01232a.htm">Agrippinus</a>, at Carthage. In the East it was also the custom of Cilicia, Cappadocia, and Galatia to rebaptize <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a> who returned to the church. Cyprian's opinion of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> was strongly expresses: "Non abluuntur illic homines, sed potius sordidantur, nec purgantur delicta sed immo cumulantur. Non Deo nativitas illa sed diabolo filios generat" (<a href="../fathers/050701.htm"><em>Treatise on Unity</em> 11</a>). A certain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Magnus, wrote to ask if the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatians</a> was to be respected (Ep. lxix). Cyprian's answer may be of the year 255; he denies that they are to be distinguished from any other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Later we find a letter in the same sense, probably of the spring of 255 (autumn, according to d'Ales), from a council under Cyprian of thirty-one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (Ep. lxx), addressed to eighteen Numidian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; this was apparently the beginning of the controversy. It appears that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Mauretania did not in this follow the custom of Proconsular Africa and Numidia, and that Pope Stephen sent them a letter approving their adherence to Roman custom.

<p>Cyprian, being consulted by a Numidian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Quintus, sent him Ep. lxx, and replied to his difficulties (Ep. lxxi). The spring council at Carthage in the following year, 256, was more numerous than usual, and sixty-one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> signed the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> letter to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> explaining their reasons for rebaptizing, and claiming that it was a question upon which <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were free to differ. This was not Stephen's view, and he immediately issued a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, couched apparently in very peremptory terms, that no "innovation" was to be made (this is taken by some moderns to mean "no new <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>"), but the Roman tradition of merely laying hands on converted <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in sign of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> must be everywhere observed, on pain of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. This letter was evidently addressed to the African <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and contained some severe censures on Cyprian himself. Cyprian writes to Jubainus that he is defending the one Church, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> founded on Peter-Why then is he called a prevaricator of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, a traitor to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>;? (Ep. lxxiii, 11). To the same correspondent he sends Epp. lxx, lxxi, lxxii; he makes no <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for others, but retains his own liberty. He sends also a copy of his newly written treatise "De Bono Patientiae". To Pompeius, who had asked to see a copy of Stephen's <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a>, he writes with great <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>: "As you read it, you will note his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> more and more clearly: in approving the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, he has heaped into his own breast the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of all of them; a fine tradition indeed! What blindness of mind, what depravity!" &#151; "ineptitude", "hard obstinacy" &#151; such are the expressions which run from the pen of one who declared that opinion on the subject was free, and who in this very letter explains that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must never be quarrelsome, but meek and teachable. In September, 256, a yet larger council assembled at Carthage. All agreed with Cyprian; Stephen was not mentioned; and some writers have even supposed that the council met before Stephen's letter was received (so <a href="../cathen/13086a.htm">Ritschl</a>, Grisar, Ernst, Bardenhewer). Cyprian did not wish the responsibility to be all his own. He declared that no one made himself a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and that all must give their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> opinion. The vote of each was therefore given in a short speech, and the minutes have come down to us in the Cyprianic correspondence under the title of "Sententiae Episcoporum". But the messengers sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with this document were refused an audience and even denied all hospitality by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. They returned incontinently to <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, and Cyprian tried for support from the East. He wrote to the famous <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03133b.htm">Caesarea</a> in Cappadocia, Firmilian, sending him the treatise "De Unitate" and the correspondence on the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> question. By the middle of November Firmilian's reply had arrived, and it has come down to us in a translation made at the time in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. Its tone is, if possible, more violent than that of Cyprian. (See <a href="../cathen/06080b.htm">FIRMILIAN</a>.) After this we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no more of the controversy.

<p>Stephen died on 27 August, 257, and was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/14031c.htm">Sixtus II</a>, who certainly communicated with Cyprian, and is called by Pontius "a good and peace-loving <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>". Probably when it was seen at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> that the East was largely committed to the same wrong practice, the question was tacitly dropped. It should be remembered that, though Stephen had demanded unquestioning obedience, he had apparently, like Cyprian, considered the matter as a point of discipline. St. Cyprian supports his view by a wrong inference from the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a>, and no one thought of the principle afterwards taught by St. Augustine, that, since Christ is always the principal agent, the validity of the sacrament is independent of the unworthiness of the minister: <em>Ipse est qui baptizat.</em> Yet this is what is implied in Stephen's insistence upon nothing more than the correct form, "because baptism is given in the name of Christ", and "the effect is due to the majesty of the Name". The <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> enjoined by Stephen is repeatedly said to be <em>in poenitentiam</em>, yet Cyprian goes on to argue that the gift of the Holy Ghost by the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> is not the new birth, but must be subsequent to it and implies it. This has led some moderns into the notion that Stephen meant confirmation to be given (so Duchesne), or at least that he has been so misunderstood by Cyprian (d'Al&egrave;s). But the passage (Ep. lxxiv, 7) need not mean this, and it is most improbable that confirmation was even thought of in this connection. Cyprian seems to consider the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> in penance to be a giving of the Holy Ghost. In the East the custom of rebaptizing <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> had perhaps arisen from the fact that so many <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> disbelieved in the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, and possibly did not even use the right form and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. For centuries the practice persisted, at least in the case of some of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. But in the West to rebaptize was regarded as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, and Africa came into line soon after St. Cyprian. St. Augustine, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15439b.htm">St. Vincent of L&eacute;rins</a> are full of praise for the firmness of Stephen as befitting his place. But Cyprian's unfortunate letters became the chief support of the puritanism of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>. St. Augustine in his "De Baptismo" goes through them one by one. He will not dwell on the violent words <em>quae in Stephanum irritatus effudit</em>, and expresses his confidence that Cyprian's glorious <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> will have atoned for his excess.
<h2>Appeals to Rome</h2>

<p>Ep. lxviii was written to Stephen before the breach. Cyprian has heard twice from Faustinus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, that Marcianus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Arles, has joined the party of <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> will certainly have been already informed of this by Faustinus and by the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province. Cyprian urges: <blockquote> You ought to send very full letters to our fellow-bishops in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, not to allow the obstinate and proud Marcianus any more to insult our fellowship...Therefore send letters to the province and to the people of Arles, by which, Marcianus having been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, another shall be substituted in his place...for the whole copious body of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is joined together by the glue of mutual concord and the bond of unity, in order that if any of our fellowship should attempt to make a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and to lacerate and devastate the flock of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the rest may give their aid...For though we are many shepherds, yet we feed one flock. </blockquote>

<p>It seems incontestable that Cyprian is here explaining to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> why he ventured to interfere, and that he attributes to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the power of deposing Marcanus and ordering a fresh election. We should compare his witness that <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> usurped a similar power as <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>.

<p>Another letter dates perhaps somewhat later. It emanates form a council of thirty seven <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and was obviously composed by Cyprian. It is addressed to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Felix and the people of <a href="../cathen/09131b.htm">Legio</a> and Asturica, and to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> &AElig;lius and the people of Emerita, in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. It relates that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Felix and Sabinus had come to Carthage to complain. They had been legitimately <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province in the place of the former <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> and Martialis, who had both accepted libelli in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> had further blasphemed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in sickness, had confessed his <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, had <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, and had been thankful to be allowed lay communion. Martialis had indulged in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> banquets and had buried his sons in a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> cemetery. He had publicly attested before the <em>procurator ducenarius</em> that he had denied Christ. Wherefore, says the letter, such men are unfit to be <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the whole Church and the late <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Pope Cornelius</a> having decided that such men may be admitted to penance but never to <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>; it does not profit them that they have deceived Pope Stephen, who was afar off and unaware of the facts, so that they obtained to be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> restored to their sees; nay, by this deceit they have only increased their guilt. The letter is thus a declaration that Stephen was wickedly deceived. No fault is imputed to him, no is there any claim to reverse his decision or to deny his right to give it; it is simply pointed out that it was founded on <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> information, and was therefore null. But it is obvious that the African council had heard only one side, whereas Felix and Sabinus must have pleaded their cause at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> before they came to <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> On this ground the Africans seem to have made too hasty a judgment. But nothing more is known of the matter.
<h2>Martyrdom</h2>

<p>The empire was surrounded by barbarian hordes who poured in on all sides. The danger was the signal for a renewal of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15256b.htm">Emperor Valerian</a>. At Alexandria St. Dionysius was exiled. On 30 August, 257, Cyprian was brought before the Proconsul Paternus in his <em>secretarium.</em> His interrogatory is extant and forms the first part of the "Acta proconsularia" of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Cyprian declares himself a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He serves one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to Whom he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> day and night for all men and for the safety of the emperor. "Do you persevere in this?" asks Paternus. "A good will which knows <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be altered." "Can you, then, go into exile at <a href="../cathen/04575a.htm">Curubis</a>?" "I go." He is asked for the names of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> also, but replies that delation is forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; they will be found easily enough in their respective cities. On September he went to <a href="../cathen/04575a.htm">Curubis</a>, accompanied by Pontius. The town was lonely, but Pontius tells us it was sunny and pleasant, and that there were plenty of visitors, while the citizens were full of kindness. He relates at length Cyprian's dream on his first night there, that he was in the proconsul's court and condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>, but was reprieved at his own request until the morrow. He awoke in terror, but once awake he awaited that morrow with calmness. It came to him on the very anniversary of the dream. In Numidia the measures were more severe. Cyprian writes to nine <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who were working in the mines, with half their hair shorn, and with insufficient food and clothing. He was still rich and able to help them. Their replies are preserved, and we have also the authentic Acts of several African <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who suffered soon after Cyprian.

<p>In August, 258, Cyprian learned that <a href="../cathen/14031c.htm">Pope Sixtus</a> had been <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> on the 6th of that month, together with four of his <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, in consequence of a new edict that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> should be at once <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>; senators, <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, and others of rank are to lose their goods, and if they still persist, to die; matrons to be exiled; Caesarians (officers of the <em>fiscus</em>) to become slaves. Galerius Maximus, the successor of Paternus, sent for Cyprian back to <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, and in his own gardens the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> awaited the final sentence. Many great personages urged him to fly, but he had now no vision to recommend this course, and he desired above all to remain to exhort others. Yet he hid himself rather than obey the proconsul's summons to <a href="../cathen/15241b.htm">Utica</a>, for he declared it was right for a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to die in his own city. On the return of Galerius to <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, Cyprian was brought from his gardens by two <em>principes</em> in a chariot, but the proconsul was ill, and Cyprian passed the night in the house of the first <em>princeps</em> in the company of his friends. Of the rest we have a vague description by Pontius and a detailed report in the proconsular Acts. On the morning of the 14th a crowd gathered "at the villa of Sextus", by order of the authorities. Cyprian was tried there. He refused to sacrifice, and added that in such a matter there was no room for thought of the consequences to himself. The proconsul read his condemnation and the multitude cried, "Let us be beheaded with him!" He was taken into the grounds, to a hollow surrounded by trees, into which many of the people climbed. Cyprian took off his cloak, and <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">knelt</a> down and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>. Then he took off his <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a> and gave it to his <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and stood in his linen tunic in silence awaiting the executioner, to whom he ordered twenty-five gold pieces to be given. The brethren cast cloths and handkerchiefs before him to catch his blood. He bandaged his own eyes with the help of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, both called Julius. So he suffered. For the rest of the day his body was exposed to satisfy the curiosity of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>. But at night the brethren bore him with candles and torches, with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and great triumph, to the cemetery of Macrobius Candidianus in the suburb of Mapalia. He was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> to obtain the crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.
<h2>Writings</h2>

<p>The correspondence of Cyprian consists of eighty-one letters. Sixty-two of them are his own, three more are in the name of councils. From this large collection we get a vivid picture of his time. The first collection of his writings must have been made just before or just after his death, as it was known to Pontius. It consisted of ten treatises and seven letters on <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. To these were added in Africa a set of letters on the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> question, and at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, it seems, the correspondence with <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a>, except Ep. xlvii. Other letters were successively aggregated to these groups, including letters to Cyprian or connected with him, his collections of Testimonies, and many spurious works. To the treatises already mentioned we have to add a well-known exposition of the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>; a work on the simplicity of dress proper to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> virgins (these are both founded on <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>); "On the Mortality", a beautiful pamphlet, composed on the occasion of the plague which reached Carthage in 252, when Cyprian, with wonderful energy, raised a staff of workers and a great fund of money for the nursing of the sick and the burial of the dead. Another work, "On Almsgiving ", its <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> character, necessity, and satisfactory value, was perhaps written, as Watson has pointed out, in reply to the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> that Cyprian's own lavish gifts were bribes to attach men to his side. Only one of his writings is couched in a pungent strain, the "ad Demetrianum", in which he replies in a spirited manner to the accusation of a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had brought the plague upon the world. Two short works, "On Patience" and "On Rivalry and Envy", apparently written during the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> controversy, were much read in ancient times. St. Cyprian was the first great Latin writer among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, for <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> fell into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and his style was harsh and unintelligible. Until the days of Jerome and Augustine, Cyprian's writings had no rivals in the West. Their praise is sung by Prudentius, who joins with Pacian, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, Augustine, and many others in attesting their extraordinary popularity.
<h2>Doctrine</h2>

<p>The little that can be extracted from St. Cyprian on the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> is correct, judged by later standards. On <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> regeneration, on the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a>, on the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>, his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is clearly and repeatedly expressed, especially in Ep. lxiv on infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and in Ep. lxiii on the mixed <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, written against the sacrilegious custom of using water without wine for Mass. On penance he is clear, like all the ancients, that for those who have been separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> there is no return except by a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> confession (<em>exomologesis apud sacerdotes</em>), followed by <em>remissio facta per sacerdotes.</em> The ordinary minister of this sacrament is the <em>sacerdos par excellence</em>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; but <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> can administer it subject to him, and in case of necessity the lapsed might be restored by a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. He does not add, as we should at the present day, that in this case there is no sacrament; such <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> distinctions were not in his line. There was not even a beginning of canon law in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> of the third century. In Cyprian's view each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is answerable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone for his action, though he ought to take counsel of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> also in all important matters. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> had a great position as honorary chief of all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the provinces of Proconsular Africa, Numidia, and Mauretania, who were about a hundred in number; but he had no actual <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over them. They seem to have met in some numbers at Carthage every spring, but their <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> decisions had no real binding force. If a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a> or become a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> or fall into <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he might be deposed by his comprovincials or by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Cyprian probably thought that questions of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> would always be too obvious to need much discussion. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that where internal questions of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> would always be too obvious to need much discussion. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that where internal discipline was concerned he considered that <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> should not interfere, and that uniformity was not desirable &#151; a most unpractical notion. We have always to remember that his experience as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> was of short duration, that he became a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> soon after he was converted, and that he had no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writings besides <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> to study besides those of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>. He evidently <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no Greek, and probably was not acquainted with the translation of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was to him the centre of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> unity; it was inaccessible to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, which had been knocking at its door for a century in vain. It was the See of Peter, who was the type of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the first of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Difference of opinion between <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as to the right occupant of the Sees of Arles or Emerita would not involve breach of communion, but rival <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> would divide the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and to communicate with the wrong one would be <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. It is controverted whether chastity was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> or only strongly urged upon <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in his day. The <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> virgins were to him the flower of his flock, the jewels of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, amid the profligacy of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>.
<h2>Spuria</h2>

<p>A short treatise, "Quod Idola dii non sint", is printed in all editions as Cyprian's. It is made up out of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and <a href="../cathen/10336a.htm">Minucius Felix</a>. Its genuineness is accepted by Benson, Monceaux, and Bardenhewer, as it was anciently by Jerome and Augustine. It has been attributed by Haussleiter to <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>, and is rejected by Harnack, Watson, and von Soden. "De Spectaculis" and "De bono pudicitiae" are, with some probability, ascribed to <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>. They are well-written letters of an absent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to his flock. "De Laude martyrii" is again attributed by Harnack to <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>; but this is not generally accepted. "Adversus Judaeos" is perhaps by a <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatianist</a> and Harnack ascribes it to <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> himself. "Ad Novatianum" is ascribed by Harnack to <a href="../cathen/14031c.htm">Pope Sixtus II</a>. Ehrhard, Benson, Nelke, and Weyman agree with him that it was written in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This is denied by Julicher, Bardenhewer, Monceaux. Rombold thinks it is by Cyprian. "De Rebaptismate" is apparently the work attributed by Genadius to a Roman named Ursinus, c. 400. He was followed by some earlier critics, Routh, Oudin, and lately by Zahn. But it was almost certainly written during the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> controversy under Stephen. It comes from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (so Harnack and others) or from Mauretania (so Ernst, Monceaux, d'Arles), and is directed against the view of Cyprian. The little <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> "De Aleatoribus" has had quite a literature of its own within the last few years, since it was attributed by Harnack to Pope Victor, and therefore accounted the earliest Latin <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writing. The controversy has at least made it clear that the author was either very early or not <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. It has been shown to be improbable that he was very early, and Harnack now admits that the work is by an <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, either <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatianist</a> or <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a>. References to all the brochures and articles on the subject will be found in Ehrhard, in Bardenhewer, and especially in Harnack (Chronol., II, 370 sqq.).

<p>"De Montibus Sina et Sion" is possibly older than Cyprian's time (see Harnack, and also Turner in Journal of Theol. Studies, July 1906). "Ad Vigilium Episcopum de Judaica incredulitate" is by a certain Celsus, and was once supposed by Harnack and Zahn to be addressed to the well-known Vigilius of <a href="../cathen/14556a.htm">Thapsus</a>, but Macholz has now convinced Harnack that it dates from either the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/15256b.htm">Valerian</a> or that of <a href="../cathen/10073b.htm">Maxentius</a>. The two "Orationes" are of uncertain date and authorship. The tract "De Singularitate clericorum" has been attributed by Dom Morin and by Harnack to the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> Bishop Macrobius in the fourth century. "De Duplici Martyrio ad Fortunatum" is found in no <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, and was apparently written by <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> in 1530. "De Pasch&acirc; computus" was written in the year preceding <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 243. All the above <em>spuria</em> are printed in Hartel's edition of Cyprian. The "Exhortatio de paenitentia" (first printed by Trombelli in 1751) is placed in the fourth or fifth century by Wunderer, but in Cyprian's time or Monceaux. Four letter are also given by Hartel; the first is the original commencement of the "Ad Donatum". The others are forgeries; the third, according to Mercati, is by a fourth-century <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a>. The six poems are by one author, of quite uncertain date. The amusing "Cena Cypriani" is found in a large number of Cyprianic <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. Its date is uncertain; it was re-edited by Blessed <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rhabanus Maurus</a>. On the use of it at pageants in the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, see Mann, "History of the Popes", II, 289.

<p>The principal editions of the works of St. Cyprian are: <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1471 (the <em>ed. princeps</em>), dedicated to <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a>; reprinted, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1471, and 1483; Memmingen, c. 1477; Deventer, c. 1477; Paris, 1500; ed. by Rembolt (Paris, 1512); by <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> (Basle, 1520 and frequently; the ed. of 1544 was printed at Cologne). A careful critical edition was prepared by Latino Latini, and published by Manutius (Rome, 1563); Morel also went to the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> (Paris, 1564); so did Pamele (Antwerp, 1568), but with less success; Rigault did somewhat better (Paris, 1648, etc.). John Fell, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a> and Dean of Christ Church, published a well-known edition from <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (Oxford, 1682). The dissertations by Dodwell and the "Annales Cyprianici" by Pearson, who arranged the letters in chronological order, make this edition important, though the text is poor. The edition prepared by Etienne <a href="../cathen/02242a.htm">Baluze</a> was brought out after his death by Dom Prudence Maran (Paris, 1726), and has been several times reprinted, especially by <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> (P.L., IV and V). The best edition is that of the Vienna Academy (C.S.E.L., vol. III, in 3 parts, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1868-1871), edited from the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> by Hartel. Since then much work has been done upon the history of the text, and especially on the order of the letters and treatises as witnessing to the genealogy of the <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a>.

The work has been interpolated; see RAMSAY, On early insertions in the third book of St. Cyprian's Text in Journal of Theol. St. (1901), II, 276. Testimonies of the ancients to Cyprian in HARNACK, Gesch. der altchristl. Lit., I; GOTZ, Gesch. der cyprianischen Literatur bis zu der Zeit der ersten erhaltenen Handschriften (Basle, 1891). On the Latin of St. Cyprian an excellent essay by WATSON, The Style and Language of St. Cyprian in Stud. Bibl. (Oxford, 1896), IV; BAYARD, Le Latin de Saint Cyprien (Paris, 1902). The letters of Cornelius are in Vulgar Latin (see MERCATI, op. cit.), and so are Epp. viii (anonymous) and xxi-xxiv (Celerinus, Lucian, Confessors, Caldonius); they have been edited by MIODONSKI, Adversus Alcatores (Erlangen and Leipzig, 1889). On the interpolations in De Unitate Eccl., see HARTEL, Preface; BENSON, pp. 200-21, 547-552; CHAPMAN, Les interpolations dans le traite de Saint Cyprien sur l'unite de l'&Eacute;glise in Revue Benedictine (1902), XIX, 246, 357, and (1903), XX, 26; HARNACK in Theo. Litt. Zeitung (1903), no. 9, and in Chronol., II; WATSON in Journal Theol. St. (1904), p. 432; CHAPMAN, ibid., p. 634, etc. On particular points see HARNACK in Texte und Untersuch., IV, 3, VIII, 2; on the letters of the Roman clergy HARNACK in Theol. Abhandl. Carl v. Weisacker gewidmet (Freiburg, 1896).</p><p class="cenotes">On Cyprian's theology much has been written. RITSCHL is fanciful and unsympathetic, BENSON untrustworthy. GOTZ, Das Christentum Cyprians (Giessen, 1896). On his trust in visions, HARNACK, Cyprian als Enthusiast in Zeitschr. fur ntl. Wiss. (1902), III, ibid. On the baptismal controversy and Cyprian's excommunication, see GRISAR in Zeitschr. fur kath. Theol. (1881), V; HOENSBROECH, ibid. (1891), XV; ERNST, ibid., XVII, XVIII, XIX. POSCHMANN, Die Sichtbarkeit der Kirche nach der Lehre des h. Cypr. (Breslau, 1907); RIOU, La genese de l'unite catholique et la pensee de Cyprien (Paris, 1907). To merely controversial works it is unnecessary to refer.</p><p class="cenotes">The above is only a selection from an immense literature on Cyprian and the pseudo-Cyprianic writings, for which see CHEVALIER, Bio-Bibl., and RICHARDSON, Bibliographical Synopsis. Good lists in VON SODEN, and in HARNACK, Chronol., II; the very full references in BARDENHEWER are conveniently classified.</p></div>
