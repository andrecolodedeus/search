<h1>St. Cyril of Alexandria</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctor of the Church</a>. St. Cyril has his feast in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> on the 28th of January; in the Greek Menaea it is found on the 9th of June, and (together with <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>) on the 18th of January.

<p>He seems to have been of an Alexandrian <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and was the son of the brother of Theophilus, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>; if he is the Cyril addressed by <a href="../cathen/08185c.htm">Isidore of Pelusium</a> in Ep. xxv of Bk. I, he was for a time a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. He accompanied Theophilus to Constantinople when that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> held the "Synod of the Oak" in 402 and deposed <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>. Theophilus died 15 Oct., 412, and on the 18th Cyril was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> his uncle's successor, but only after a riot between his supporters and those of his rival Timotheus. <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> complains bitterly that one of his first acts was to plunder and shut the churches of the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatians</a>. He also drove out of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who had formed a flourishing community there since Alexander the Great. But they had caused tumults and had massacred the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, to defend whom Cyril himself assembled a mob. This may have been the only possible defence, since the Prefect of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Orestes, who was very angry at the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> was also jealous of the power of Cyril, which certainly rivaled his own. Five hundred <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> came down from Nitria to defend the patriarch. In a disturbance which arose, Orestes was wounded in the head by a stone thrown by a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> named Ammonius. The prefect had Ammonius tortured to death, and the young and fiery patriarch <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> his remains for a time as those of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. The Alexandians were always riotous as we learn from <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> (VII, vii) and from St. Cyril himself (Hom. for Easter, 419). In one of these riots, in 422, the prefect Callistus was killed, and in another was committed the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Hypatia, a highly-respected teacher of neo-Platoism, of advanced age and (it is said) many virtues. She was a friend of Orestes, and many believed that she prevented a reconciliation between the prefect and patriarch. A mob led by a <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a>, named Peter, dragged her to a church and tore her flesh with potsherds till she died. This brought great disgrace, says <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, on the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Church of Alexandria</a> and on its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; but a <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> was not a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> (Scr., V, xxii), and <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> does not suggest that Cyril himself was to blame. Damascius, indeed, accuses him, but he is a late authority and a hater of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.

<p>Theophilus, the persecutor of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, had not the privilege of communion with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> from that saint's death, in 406, until his own. For some years Cyril also refused to insert the name of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> of his Church, in spite of the requests of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom's</a> supplanter, Atticus. Later he seems to have yielded to the representations of his spiritual father, Isisdore of <a href="../cathen/11610d.htm">Pelusium</a> (Isid., Ep. I, 370). Yet even after the Council of Ephesus that saint still found something to rebuke in him on this matter (Ep. I, 310). But at last Cyril seems to have long since been trusted by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>It was in the winter of 427-28 that the Antiochene Nestorius became <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople. His <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> teaching soon became known to Cyril. Against him Cyril taught the use of the term <em>Theotokus</em> in his Paschal letter for 429 and in a letter to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. A correspondence with Nestorius followed, in a more moderate tone than might have been expected. Nestorius sent his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> to Pope Celestine, but he received no reply, for the latter wrote to St. Cyril for further information. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> had taken the side of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> against Theophilus, but had neither censured the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of the latter, nor consented to the patriarchal powers exercised by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Constantinople. To St. Celestine Cyril was not only the first <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> of the East, he was also the inheritor of the traditions of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> and Peter. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> confidence was not misplaced. Cyril had learnt <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Peter had attempted unsuccessfully to appoint a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantinople; Theophilus had deposed another. Cyril, though in this case Alexandria was in the right, does not act in his own name, but denounces Nestorius to St. Celestine, since ancient custom, he says, persuaded him to bring the matter before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He relates all that had occurred, and begs Celestine to <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> what he sees fit (<em>typosai to dokoun</em>--a phrase which Dr. Bright chooses to weaken into "formulate his opinion"), and communicate it also to the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a> and of the East (i.e. the Antiochene Patriarchate).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> reply was of astonishing severity. He had already commissioned Cassian to write his well known treatise on the Incarnation. He now summoned a council (such Roman councils had somewhat the office of the modern <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a>), and dispatched a letter to Alexandria with enclosures to Constantinople, <a href="../cathen/12007c.htm">Philippi</a>, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and Antioch. Cyril is to take to himself the authority of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a> and to admonish Nestorius that unless he recants within ten days from the receipt of this ultimatum, he is separated from "our body" (the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of the day had the habit of speaking of the other churches as the members, of which they are the head; the body is, of course the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>). If Nestorius does not submit, Cyril is to "provide for" the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople. Such a sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and deposition is not to be confounded with the mere withdrawal of actual communion by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> from Cyril himself at an earlier date, from Theophilus, or, in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, from <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a> or Meletius. It was the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> Cyril has asked for. As Cyril had twice written to Nestorius, his citation in the name of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is to be counted as a third warning, after which no grace is to be given.



<p>St. Cyril summoned a council of his suffragans, and composed a letter which were appended twelve propositions for Nestorius to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a>. The epistle was not conciliatory, and Nestorius may well have been taken aback. The twelve propositions did not emanate from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and were not equally clear; one or two of them were later among the authorities invoked by the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in their own favour. Cyril was the head of the rival <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> to that of Antioch, where Nestorius had studied, and was the hereditary rival of the Constantinopolitan would-be patriarch. Cyril wrote also to John, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, informing him of the facts, and insinuating that if John should support his old friend Nestorius, he would find himself isolated over against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. John took the hint and urged Nestorius to yield. Meanwhile, in Constantinople itself large numbers of the people held aloof from Nestorius, and the Emperor Theodosius II had been persuaded to summon a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> to meet at Ephesus. The imperial letters were dispatched 19 November, whereas the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> sent by Cyril arrived at Constantinople only on 7 December. Nestorius, somewhat naturally, refused to accept the message sent by his rival, and on the 13th and 14th of December preached publicly against Cyril as a <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniator</a>, and as having used bribes (which was probably as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> as it was usual); but he declared himself willing to use the word <em>Theotokos</em>. These sermons he sent to <a href="../cathen/08468a.htm">John of Antioch</a>, who preferred them to the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizations</a> of Cyril. Nestorius, however, issued twelve propositions with appended <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathemas</a>. If Cyril's propositions might be might be taken to deny the two natures in Christ, those of Nestorius hardly veiled his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in two distinct <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Theodoret urged John yet further, and wrote a treatise against Cyril, to which the latter replied with some warmth. He also wrote an "Answer" in five books to the sermons of Nestorius.

<p>As the fifteenth-century <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of an oecumenical council superior to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had yet to be invented, and there was but one precedent for such an assembly, we need not be surprised that St. Celestine welcomed the initiative of the emperor, and hoped for peace through the assembly. (See <a href="../cathen/05491a.htm">COUNCIL OF EPHESUS</a>.) Nestorius found the churches of Ephesus closed to him, when he arrived with the imperial commissioner, Count Candidian, and his own friend, Count <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>. Cyril came with fifty of his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Palestine, Crete, <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, and Greece added their quotient. But <a href="../cathen/08468a.htm">John of Antioch</a> and his suffragans were delayed. Cyril may have believed, rightly or wrongly, that John did not wish to be present at the trial of his friend Nestorius, or that he wished to gain time for him, and he opened the council without John, on 22 June, in spite of the request of sixty-eight <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for a delay. This was an initial <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, which had disastrous results.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> had not arrived, so that Cyril had no answer to the letter he had written to Celestine asking "whether the holy synod should receive a man who condemned what it preached, or, because the time of delay had elapsed, whether the sentence was still in force". Cyril might have presumed that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in agreeing to send <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to the council, intended Nestorius to have a complete trial, but it was more convenient to assume that the Roman ultimatum had not been suspended, and that the council was bound by it. He therefore took the place of president, not only as the highest of rank, but also as still holding the place of Celestine, though he cannot have received any fresh commission from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Nestorius was summoned, in order that he might explain his neglect of Cyril's former monition in the name of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He refused to receive the four <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> whom the council sent to him. Consequently nothing remained but formal procedure. For the council was bound <em>by the canons</em> to depose Nestorius for <a href="../cathen/04340a.htm">contumacy</a>, as he would not appear, and <em>by the letter of Celestine</em> to condemn him for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, as he had not recanted. The correspondence between <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, and Constantinople was read, some testimonies where read from earlier writers show the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Nestorius. The second letter of Cyril to Nestorius was approved by all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The reply of Nestorius was condemned. No discussion took place. The letter of Cyril and the ten <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathemaizations</a> raised no comment. All was concluded at one sitting. The council declared that it was "of necessity impelled" by the canons and by the letter of Celestine to declare Nestorius deposed and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a>, who had been detained by bad weather, arrived on the 10th of July, and they solemnly confirmed the sentence by the authority of St. Peter, for the refusal of Nestorius to appear had made useless the permission which they brought from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to grant him forgiveness if he should repent. But meanwhile <a href="../cathen/08468a.htm">John of Antioch</a> and his party had arrived on the 26th and 27th of June. They formed themselves into a rival council of forty-three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and deposed Memnon, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ephesus, and St. Cyril, accusing the latter of <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarianism</a> and even of <a href="../cathen/05605a.htm">Eunomianism</a>. Both parties now appealed to the emperor, who took the amazing decision of sending a count to treat Nestorius, Cyril, and Memnon as being all three lawfully deposed. They were kept in close custody; but eventually the emperor took the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> view, though he dissolved the council; Cyril was allowed to return to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and Nestorius went into retirement at Antioch. Later he was banished to the Great Oasis of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.

<p>Meanwhile Pope Celestine was dead. His successor, <a href="../cathen/14032a.htm">St. Sixtus III</a>, confirmed the council and attempted to get <a href="../cathen/08468a.htm">John of Antioch</a> to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> Nestorius. For some time the strongest opponent of Cyril was Theodoret, but eventually he approved a letter of Cyril to Acacius of Berhoea. John sent Paul, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05402a.htm">Emesa</a>, as his plenipotentiary to <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, and he patched up reconciliation with Cyril. Though Theodoret still refused to denounce the defence of Nestorius, John did so, and Cyril declared his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in a letter to John. <a href="../cathen/08185c.htm">Isidore of Pelusium</a> was now afraid that the impulsive Cyril might have yielded too much (Ep. i, 334). The great patriarch composed many further treatises, dogmatic letters, and sermons. He died on the 9th or the 27th of June, 444, after an episcopate of nearly thirty-two years.
<h2>St. Cyril as a theologian</h2>

<p>The principal fame of St. Cyril rests upon his defence of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> against Nestorius. That <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> was undoubtedly confused and uncertain. He wished, against Apollinarius, to teach that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was a perfect man, and he took the denial of a human <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> to imply an <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarian</a> incompleteness in His Human Nature. The union of the human and the Divine natures was therefore to Nestorius an unspeakably close junction, but not a <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">union in one hypostasis</a>. St. Cyril taught the personal, or <em>hypostatic</em>, union in the plainest terms; and when his writings are surveyed as a whole, it becomes certain that he always held the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> view, that the one Christ has two perfect and distinct natures, Divine and human. But he would not admit two <em>physeis</em> in Christ, because he took <em>physis</em> to imply not merely a nature but a subsistent (i.e. personal) nature. His opponents misrepresented him as teaching that the Divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> suffered, in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and he was constantly accused of <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarianism</a>. On the other hand, after his death <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a> was founded upon a misinterpretation of his teaching. Especially unfortunate was the formula "one nature incarnate of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>" (<em>mia physis tou Theou Logou sesarkomene</em>), which he took from a treatise on the Incarnation which he believed to be by his great predecessor St. Athanasius. By this phrase he intended simply to emphasize against Nestorius the unity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Person; but the words in fact expressed equally the single Nature taught by <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a> and by his own successor Diascurus. He brings out admirably the necessity of the full <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the humanity to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to explain the scheme of the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of man. He argues that the flesh of Christ is truly the flesh of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in that it is life-giving in the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>. In the richness and depth of his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and devotional treatment of the Incarnation we recognize the disciple of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>. But the precision of his language, and perhaps of his thought also, is very far behind that which <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo</a> developed a few years after Cyril's death.

<p>Cyril was a man of great <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and force of character. We can often discern that his natural vehemence was repressed and schooled, and he listened with <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> to the severe admonitions of his master and advisor, St. Isidore. As a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, he is one of the great writers and thinkers of early times. Yet the troubles that arose out of the Council of Ephesus were due to his impulsive action; more patience and diplomacy might possibly even have prevented the vast <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> from arising at all. In spite of his own firm grasp of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the whole of his patriarch fell away, a few years after his time, into a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> based on his writings, and could never be regained by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. But he has always been greatly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. His letters, especially the second letter to Nestorius, were not only approved by the Council of Ephesus, but by many subsequent councils, and have frequently been appealed to as tests of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. In the East he was always <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as one of the greatest of the Doctors. His <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> and <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a> as a <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctor of the Church</a> were approved by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in 1883.
<h2>His writings</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> works of St. Cyril are very numerous. The seventeen books "On Adoration in Spirit and in Truth" are an exposition of the typical and spiritual nature of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. The <em>Glaphyra</em> or "brilliant", Commentaries on <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> are of the same nature. Long explanations of Isaias and of the minor Prophets give a mystical interpretation after the Alexandrian manner. Only fragments are extant of other works on the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, as well as of expositions of Matthew, Luke, and some of the Epistles, but of that of St. Luke much is preserved in a Syriac version. Of St. Cyril's sermons and letters the most interesting are those which concern the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> controversy. Of a great apologetic work in the twenty books against <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a> ten books remain. Among his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> treatises we have two large works and one small one on the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, and a number of treatises and tracts belonging to the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> controversy.

<p>The first collected edition of St. Cyril's works was by J. Aubert, 7 vols., Paris, 1638; several earlier editions of some portions in Latin only are enumerated by <a href="../cathen/05745a.htm">Fabricius</a>. <a href="../cathen/09538a.htm">Cardinal Mai</a> added more material in the second and third volumes of his "Bibliotheca nova Patrum", II-III, 1852; this is incorporated, together with much matter from the Caten&aelig; published by Ghislerius (1633), <a href="../cathen/04359a.htm">Corderius</a>, Possinus, and Cranor (1838), in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne's</a> reprint of Aubert's edition (P.G. LXVIII-LXVII, Paris, 1864). Better editions of single works include P. E. Pusey, "Cyrilli Alex. Epistolae tres oecumenicae, libri V c. Nestorium, XII capitum explanatio, XII capitum defensio utraque scholia de Incarnatione Unigeniti" (Oxford, 1875); "De recta fide ad principissas de recta fide ad Augustas, quad unus Christus, dialogus apologeticus ad Imp." (Oxford, 1877); "Cyrilli Alex. in XII Prophetas" (Oxford, 1868, 2 vols.); "In divi Joannis Evangelium" (Oxford, 1872, 3 vols., including the fragments on the Epistles). "Three Epistles, with revised text and English translation" (Oxford, 1872); translations in the Oxford "Library of the Fathers"; "Commentary on St. John", I (1874), II (1885); Five tomes against Nestorius" (1881); R. Payne Smith, "S. Cyrilli Alex. Comm. in Lucae evang. quae supersunt Syriace e manuscripts apud Mus. Brit." (Oxford, 1858); the same translated into English (Oxford, 1859, 2 vols.); W. Wright, "Fragments of the Homilies of Cyril of Alex. on St. Luke, edited from a Nitrian manuscript" (London, 1874); J. H. Bernard, "On Some Fragments of an Uncial manuscript of St. Cyril of Alex. Written on Papyrus" (Trans. of R. <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Acad., XXIX, 18, Dublin, 1892); "Cyrilli Alex. librorum c. Julianum fragmenta syriaca", ed. E. Nestle etc. in "Scriptorum grecorum, qui Christianam impugnaverunt religionem", fasc. III (Leipzig, 1880). Fragments of the "Liber Thesaurorum" in Pitra, "Analecta sacra et class.", I (Paris, 1888).

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The best biography of St. Cyril is, perhaps, still that by TILLEMONT in <em>M&eacute;moires pour servir</em>, etc., XIV. See also KOPALLIK, <em>Cyrillus von Alexandrien</em> (Mainz, 1881), an apology for St. Cyril's teaching and character. A moderate view is taken by BRIGHT in <em>Waymarks of Church History</em> (London, 1894) and <em>The Age of the Fathers</em> (London, 1903), II, but he is recognized as prejudiced wherever the papacy is in question.
