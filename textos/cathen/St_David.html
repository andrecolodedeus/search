<h1>St. David</h1>  

<p>(DEGUI, DEWI).

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> and Confessor, patron of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>. He is usually represented standing on a little hill, with a dove on his shoulder. From time immemorial the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> have worn a leek on St. David's day, in memory of a battle against the Saxons, at which it is said they wore leeks in their hats, by St. David's advice, to distinguish them from their enemies. He is commemorated on 1 March. The earliest mention of St. David is found in a tenth-century <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> Of the "Annales Cambriae", which assigns his death to A.D. 601. Many other writers, from <a href="../cathen/06428a.htm">Geoffrey of Monmouth</a> down to Father Richard Stanton, hold that he died about 544, but their opinion is based solely on data given in various late "lives" of St. David, and there seems no good reason for setting aside the definite statement of the "Annales Cambriae", which is now generally accepted. Little else that can claim to be historical is known about St. David. The tradition that he was born at Henvynyw (Vetus-Menevia) in Cardiganshire is not improbable. He was prominent at the Synod of Brevi (Llandewi Brefi in Cardiganshire), which has been identified with the important Roman military station, Loventium. Shortly afterwards, in 569, he presided over another <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held at a place called Lucus Victoriae. He was Bishop (probably not <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>) of <a href="../cathen/10187d.htm">Menevia</a>, the Roman port Menapia in Pembrokeshire, later known as St. David's, then the chief point of departure for <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. St. David was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Pope Callistus II</a> in the year 1120.

<p>This is all that is known to history about the patron of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>. His legend, however, is much more elaborate, and entirely unreliable. The first biography that has come down to us was written near the end of the eleventh century, about 500 years after the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> death, by Rhygyfarch (Ricemarchus), a son of the then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of St. David's, and is chiefly a tissue of inventions intended to support the claim of the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> episcopate to be independent of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. <a href="../cathen/06568d.htm">Giraldus Cambriensis</a>, <a href="../cathen/15633d.htm">William of Malmesbury</a>, <a href="../cathen/06428a.htm">Geoffrey of Monmouth</a>, John de Tinmouth, and John Capgrave all simply copy and enlarge upon the work of Rhygyfarch, whilst the anonymous author of the late <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> life printed in Rees, "Cambro-British Saints" (Cott. <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> Titus, D. XXII) adds nothing of value. According to these writers St. David was the son of Sant or Sandde ab Ceredig ab Cunnedda, Prince of Keretica (Cardiganshire) and said by some to be King Arthur's nephew, though <a href="../cathen/06428a.htm">Geoffrey of Monmouth</a> calls St. David King Arthur's uncle. The saint's mother was Nonna, or Nonnita (sometimes called Melaria), a daughter of Gynyr of Caergawch. She was a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> who had been violated by Sant. St. David's birth had been foretold thirty years before by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>. It took place at "Old Menevia" somewhere about A.D. 454. Prodigies preceded and accompanied the event, and at his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> at Porth Clais by St. Elvis of Munster, "whom Divine Providence brought over from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> at that conjuncture", a blind man was cured by the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> water. St. David's early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was received from <a href="../cathen/07661a.htm">St. Illtyd</a> at Caerworgorn (Llantwit major) in Glamorganshire. Afterwards he spent ten years studying the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> at Whitland in Carmarthenshire, under St. Paulinus, (Pawl Hen), whom he cured of blindness by the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>. At the end of this period St. Paulinus, warned by an angel, sent out the young saint to evangelize the British. St. David journeyed throughout the West, founding or restoring twelve <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> (among which occur the great names of Glastonbury, Bath, and Leominster), and finally settled in the Vale of <a href="../cathen/13201a.htm">Ross</a>, where he and his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> lived a life of extreme austerity. Here occurred the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> by the obscene antics of the maid-servants of the wife of Boia, a local chieftan. Here also his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> tried to poison him, but St. David, warned by St. Scuthyn, who crossed from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in one night on the back of a sea-monster, blessed the poisoned bread and ate it without harm. From thence, with <a href="../cathen/14473b.htm">St. Teilo</a> and St. Padarn, he set out for <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, where he was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by the patriarch. Here too <a href="../cathen/05179a.htm">St. Dubric</a> and St. Daniel found him, when they came to call him to the Synod of Brevi "against the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>". St. David was with difficulty persuaded to accompany them; on his way he raised a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow's</a> son to life, and at the synod preached so loudly, from the hill that <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> rose under him, that all could hear him, and so eloquently that all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> were confounded. <a href="../cathen/05179a.htm">St. Dubric</a> resigned the "Archbishopric of Caerleon", and St. David was appointed in his stead. One of his first acts was to hold, in the year 569, yet another synod called "Victory", against the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, of which the decrees were confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. With the permission of King Arthur he removed his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> from Caerleon to <a href="../cathen/10187d.htm">Menevia</a>, whence he governed the British Church for many years with great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and wisdom. He died at the great age of 147, on the day predicted by himself a week earlier. His body is said to have been translated to Glastonbury in the year 966.

<p>It is impossible to discover in this story how much, if any, is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Some of it has obviously been invented for controversial purposes. The twelve <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, the temptation by the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, the attempt on his life, all suggest an imitation of the life of St. Benedict. Wilder legends, such as the Journey on the Sea-Monster, are commonplaces of Celtic <a href="../cathen/07106b.htm">hagiography</a>. Doubtless Rhygyfarch and his imitators collected many floating local traditions, but how much of these had any historical foundation and how much was sheer <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is no longer possible to decide.
