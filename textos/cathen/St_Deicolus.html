<h1>St. Deicolus</h1>  

<p>(DICHUIL)

<p>Elder brother of St. Gall, b. in Leinster, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, c. 530; d. at Lure, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 18 January, 625. Having studied at Bangor he was selected as one of the twelve disciples to accompany St. Columbanus in his missionary enterprise. After a short stay in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> he journeyed to <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, in 576, and laboured with St. Columbanus in Austrasia and <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. At Luxeuil he was unwearied in his ministrations, and yet was always serene and even <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyous</a>. When St. Columbanus was expelled by Thierry, in 610, St. Deicolus, then eighty tears of age, determined to follow his master, but was forced, after a short time, to give up the journey, and settled in a deserted place called Lutre, or Lure (French Jura), in the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>, to which he had been directed by a swineherd. Till his death, he was thenceforth the apostle of this district, where he was given a little church and a tract of land by Berthelde, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Weifar, the lord of Lure. Soon a noble <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was erected for his many disciples, and the Rule of St. Columbanus was adopted. Numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are recorded of St. Deicolus, including the suspension of his cloak on a sunbeam and the taming of wild beasts. Clothaire II, King of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, recognised the virtues of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> and considerably enriched the Abbey of Lure, also granting St. Deicolus the manor, woods, fisheries, etc. of the town which had grown around the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Feeling his end approaching, St. Deicolus gave over the government of his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> to Columbanus, one of his young <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and spent his remaining days in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and meditation. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 18 January. So revered was his memory that his name (Dichuil), under the slightly disguised form of Deel and Deela, is still borne by most of the children of the Lure district. His Acts were written by a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of his own <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the tenth century.
