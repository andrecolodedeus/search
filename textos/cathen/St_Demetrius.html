<h1>St. Demetrius</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> from 188 to 231. <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Julius Africanus</a>, who visited Alexandria in the time of Demetrius, places his accession as eleventh <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> after St. Mark in the tenth year of <a href="../cathen/04166a.htm">Commodus</a> (tenth of Severus &#151; Eusebius' <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.2</a> is a slip). A legendary history of him is given in the Coptic "Synaxaria", in an <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> poem cited by the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>, and in the "Chronicon Orientale" of Abraham Ecchellensis the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a>. Three of their statements, however, may have some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: one that he died at the age of 105 (born, therefore, in 126); another, found also in the <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> Patriarch <a href="../cathen/05639a.htm">Eutychius</a> [Sa'id Ibn Batrik, (d. about 940), <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G., CXI, 999], that he wrote about the calculation of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> to Victor of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Maximus (i.e. Maximinus) of Antioch and Gabius or Agapius (?) of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (cf. Eus., <a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.25</a>). <a href="../cathen/05639a.htm">Eutychius</a> relates that from Mark to Demetrius there was but one see in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, that Demetrius was the first to establish three other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, and that his successor <a href="../cathen/07242a.htm">Heraclas</a> made twenty more.

<p>At all events Demetrius is the first Alexandrian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of whom anything is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> has it that he sent Pant&aelig;nus on a mission to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, but it is likely that Clement had succeeded Pant&aelig;nus as the head of the famous Catechetical School before the accession of Demetrius. When Clement retired (c. 203-4), Demetrius appointed the young <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, who was in his eighteenth year, in Clement's place. Demetrius encouraged <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> when blamed for his too literal execution of an allegorical counsel of our Lord, and is said to have shown him great favour. He sent <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> to the governor of Arabia, who had requested his presence in letters to the prefect of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> as well as to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In 215-16 <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to take refuge in Caesarea from the cruelty of <a href="../cathen/03328c.htm">Caracalla</a>. There he preached at the request of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> present. Demetrius wrote to him complaining that this was unheard of presumption in a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. <a href="../cathen/01295b.htm">Alexander of Jerusalem</a> and Theoctistus of Caesarea wrote to defend the invitation they had given, mentioning precedents; but Demetrius recalled <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>. In 230 Demetrius gave <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> a recommendation to take with him on his journey to Athens. But <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at Caesarea without leave, and Demetrius with a synod of some <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and a few <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> condemned him to banishment, then from another synod sent a formal condemnation of him to all the churches. It is impossible to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and not merely unauthorized <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, must have been alleged by Demetrius for such a course. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> accepted the decision, but Palestine, <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaia</a> rejected it, and <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> retired to <a href="../cathen/03133b.htm">Caesarea</a>, whence he sent forth letters in his own defence, and attacked Demetrius. The latter placed at the head of the Catechetical School the first pupil of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="../cathen/07242a.htm">Heraclas</a>, who had long been his assistant. But the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> died very soon, and <a href="../cathen/07242a.htm">Heraclas</a> succeeding him, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> returned to Alexandria.
