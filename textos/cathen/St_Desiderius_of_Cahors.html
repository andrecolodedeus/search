<div id="springfield2">
<h1>St. Desiderius of Cahors</h1>  

<p>Bishop, b. at Obrege (perhaps Antobroges, name of a Gaulish tribe), on the frontier of the Provincia Narbonnensis, of a noble <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> from Aquitaine, which possessed large estates in the territory of <a href="../cathen/01267a.htm">Albi</a>; d. 15 Nov., 655--though Krusch has called this date in question. In his childhood Desiderius was profoundly impressed by the religious atmosphere of his home. His father Salvius was a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and his mother Herchenefreda shows herself a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of serious religious sentiment in three letters to her son, mentioned in his "Vita". With his two brothers, Rusticus and Syagrius, the boy Desiderius came to the court of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> king Chlotar II (584-629; from 613 sovereign of the whole <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire), and with other boys of noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> received an excellent <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at the Merovingian court-school, whence in the seventh century went forth many capable and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Rusticus became a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and finally <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a>; Syagrius became count of the territory of <a href="../cathen/01267a.htm">Albi</a> and prefect of the city of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>; Desiderius stayed on at the court where he held the important office of royal treasurer, an office that he retained under the new king, Dagobert (629-639), whose confidant he was. After the death of Syagrius (629), he is said to have obtained also the prefectship of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, but this is not certain.

<p>Faithful to the admonitions of his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> mother, Desiderius led at court the serious holy life of a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, and administered his office with great fidelity. In 630 his brother Resticus, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a>, was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a>, whereupon the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people of that city requested from the king Desiderius as his successor. By a letter of 8 April, 630, Dagobert made known his consent, and Desiderius was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a>. His close relations with the Court he used in the interests of his Church. With the most important <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his time, many of them <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> with him at the royal court, he maintained an active intercourse, as his letters prove. He was a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> promoter of monastic life and founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the vicinity of <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a>, the church of which was dedicated to St. Amantius; later on the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> was called after its founder <a href="../cathen/06537b.htm">St. G&eacute;ry</a> (i.e. Dierius, from Desiderius). He directed also a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, as we see from a letter written by him to the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> Aspasia. Under him and with his support was likewise founded in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Peter of Moissac, later so celebrated. Desiderius was very <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for Divine service and the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>; he built three large <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> in and near Cahors (St. Maria, St. Peter, St. Julian) and an oratory in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Martin. For the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> he was a severe disciplinarian, but was himself foremost with the example of a holy life. He also promoted the temporal welfare of the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a>, built an aqueduct, and erected or restored the walls and towers that protected the city. Desiderius persuaded the nobles of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> to endow richly the churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. By his testament (649-650) he gave all his possessions to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the churches, and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of his episcopal city. While resident on his estates in the district of <a href="../cathen/01267a.htm">Albi</a> he fell ill and died at his villa of Wistrilingo, which he had presented to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Amantius. His body was carried to Cahors and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Amantius. We possess a "Vita" of Desiderius written shortly after his death, a collection of his letters, also of letters addressed to him, and an account of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> that took place at his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on the 15th of November.
