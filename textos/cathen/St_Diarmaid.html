<h1>St. Diarmaid</h1>  

<p>Born in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> unknown; d. in 851 or 852. He was made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a> in 834, but was driven from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> by the usurper Foraunan in 835. However, he claimed his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and collected his cess in Connacht, in 836, as <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>. He lived in a stormy age, as the Scandinavian rovers under Turgesius seized Armagh, in 841, and levelled the churches. The "Annals of Ulster" (ed. B. McCarthy, Dublin, 1887; I, 361) describe him as "the wisest of the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>". His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated 24 April.
<h2>St. Diarmaid the Just</h2>

<p>A famous <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> confessor of the mid-sixth century; d. 542. His name is associated with the great <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Inisclothran (Iniscleraun) on Lough Ree, in the Dioeese of <a href="../cathen/01699c.htm">Ardagh</a>, which he founded about the year 530. He was of princely origin and a native of Connacht. Wishing to found an oratory far from the haunts of men, he selected the beautiful but lonely island associated with the memory of Queen Meave, now known as Quaker Island. Here his fame soon attracted disciples, and among them St. Ciaran of Clonmacnoise. He was not only a good teacher, but also a distinguished writer and poet. On the island seven churches are traditionally said to have been erected, and the traces of six are still in evidence, including <em>Teampul Diarmada</em>, or the church of St. Diarmaid, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> own church an oratory eight feet by seven. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated 10 January. After his death the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> kept up its reputation for fully six centuries, and the island itself was famous for <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> in pre-Reformation days.
