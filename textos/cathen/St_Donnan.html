<h1>St. Donnan</h1>  

<p>There were apparently three or four saints of this name who flourished about the seventh century.

<p>(1) ST. DONNAN, ABBOT OF EIGG, and ST. DONNAN OF AUCHTERLESS are regarded by both the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> and <a href="../cathen/04717a.htm">Dempster</a> as different personages, but there is so much confusion in their <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> and repetition in what is known of them, that it seems more probable that they were identical. Reeves (<a href="../cathen/01135c.htm">Adamnan's</a> Life of St. Columba), moreover, accepts them as the same without discussion. According to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> annals St. Donnan was a friend and disciple of St. Columba, who followed him from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> toward the end of the sixth century. Seeking a solitary retreat, he and his companions settled on the island of Eigg, off the west coast of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, then used only to pasture sheep belonging to the queen of the country. Informed of this invasion, the queen ordered that all should forthwith be slain. Her agents, probably a marauding band of Picts, or pirates according to one account, arrived during the celebration of Mass on <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Easter eve</a>. Being requested to wait until the Sacrifice was concluded, they did so, and then St. Donnan and his fifty-one companions gave themselves up to the sword. This was in 617. Reeves mentions eleven churches dedicated to St. Donnan; in that at Auchterless his <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">pastoral staff</a> was preserved up to the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> and is said to have worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. The island of Eigg was still <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in 1703 and St. Donnan's memory <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> there (Martin, Journey to the Western Islands, London, 1716).

<p>(2) SON OF LIATH, and nephew and disciple of <a href="../cathen/13713a.htm">St. Senan</a>, in whose life it is related that by his uncle's direction he restored to life two boys who had been drowned. This St. Donnan succeeded St. Ciaran of Clonmacnoise as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Aingin, an island in Lough Ree, on the Shannon (now Hare Island). He flourished about the middle of the sixth century.

<p>(3) ST. DONNAN THE DEACON, son of Beoadh and brother of St. Ciaran. He was a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in his brother's <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Cluain, or <a href="../cathen/04065a.htm">Clonmacnoise</a>, in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, in the sixth century.
