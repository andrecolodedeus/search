<h1>St. Eata</h1>  

<p>Second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Hexham</a>; <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; died 26 October, 686. Whether this disciple of <a href="../cathen/01233d.htm">St. Aidan</a> was of the English, or of the aboriginal Pictish, race, there is no means of judging. As early as 651 he was elected Abbot of Melrose, which was then within the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>. With the increase of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> population in northeastern Britain, the spiritual government of a territory was so wide as that which was then called Northumbria became too heavy a charge for one see; accordingly, in 678 <a href="../cathen/14571a.htm">Archbishop Theodore</a> constituted Bernicia (that part of the Northumbrian realm which lay to the north of the River Tees) a suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Eata its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was to have two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a>, one at <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Hexham</a> and the other at <a href="../cathen/09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a>, at the two extremities of what is now the County of Northumberland. Eata was to be styled "Bishop of the Bernicians". This arrangement lasted only three years, and the See of <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Hexham</a> was then assigned to Trumbert, while Eata kept <a href="../cathen/09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a>. In 684, after the death of Trumbert, <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a> was elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Hexham</a>, but when the latter expressed a desire to remain in his old home rather than remove to a more southern see, Eata readily consented to exchange with him, and for the last two years of his life occupied the See of <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Hexham</a>, while Cuthbert ruled as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at <a href="../cathen/09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a>. Like most of the early <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the English Church, St. Eata was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by general repute of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> among the faithful in the regions which he helped to Christianize. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 26 October, the day of his death.
