<h1>St. Edmund Rich</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, born 20 November, c. 1180, at <a href="../cathen/01043c.htm">Abingdon</a>, six miles from Oxford; died 16 November, 1240, at Soissy, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. His early <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> is somewhat uncertain. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, Reinald (Reginald) and Mabel Rich, were remarkable for <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. It is said that his mother constantly wore hair-cloth, and attended almost every night at <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church. His father, even during the lifetime of his mother, entered the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Eynsham in Oxfordshire. Edmund had two sisters and at least one brother. The two sisters became <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> at Catesby. From his earliest years he was taught by his mother to practise acts of penance, such as <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> on Saturdays on bread and water, and wearing a hair shirt. When old enough he was sent to study at Oxford. While there, the Child Christ appeared to him while he was walking alone in the fields. In memory of what passed between him and Christ on that occasion, he used every night to sign his forehead with the words "Jesus of Nazareth", a custom he recommended to others. Anxious to preserve purity of mind and body, Edmund made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of chastity, and as a pledge thereof he procured two rings; one he placed on the finger of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady's</a> <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> in St. Mary's Oxford, the other he himself wore.

<p>About 1195, in company with his brother Richard, he was sent to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Thenceforward, for several years, his life was spent between Oxford and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He taught with success in both <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>. After having devoted himself to the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, Edmund acquired fame as a preacher, and was commissioned to preach the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section6">Sixth Crusade</a> in various parts of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. All this time his austerities were very great. Most of the night he spent in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and the little sleep he allowed himself was taken without lying down. Though thus severe to himself, he was gentle and kind towards others, especially to the poor and sick, whom sometimes he personally attended. In 1222 Edmund became treasurer of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Ten years later he was appointed to the <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Archbishopric of Canterbury</a> by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 2 April, 1234.

<p>Notwithstanding the gentleness of his disposition, he firmly defended the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> against the exactions and usurpations of Henry III. He visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1237 to plead his cause in person. This fearless policy brought him into conflict, not only with the king and his party, but also with the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Rochester and <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. Determined opposition met him from all sides, and constant appeals were carried to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> over his head. In consequence, a <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> was sent to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but Henry adroitly managed the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate's</a> authority to nullify Edmund's power. Unable to force the king to give over the control of vacant <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, and determined not to countenance <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, Edmund saw he could not longer remain in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In 1240 he retired to the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/12233a.htm">Abbey of Pontigny</a>. Here he lived like a simple religious till the summer heat drove him to Soissy, where he died. Within six years he was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>, and numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> have been wrought at his shrine. Notwithstanding the devastation that from time to time has overtaken <a href="../cathen/12233a.htm">Pontigny</a>, the body of St. Edmund is still <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in its <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church. Important <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> are preserved at <a href="../cathen/15599a.htm">Westminster Cathedral</a>; St. Edmund's College, Ware; Portsmouth Cathedral, and Erdington Abbey. The ancient proper Mass of St. Edmund, taken from the Sarum <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, is used in the <a href="../cathen/12296a.htm">Diocese of Portsmouth</a>, of which St. Edmund is patron. In September, 1874, 350 English <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> visited St. Edmund's shrine. The community, known as Fathers of St. Edmund, were forced to leave their home at <a href="../cathen/12233a.htm">Pontigny</a>, by the Associations law. The "Speculum Ecclesiae", an <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> treatise, and the "Provincial Constitutions" are the most important of St. Edmund's writings.
