<h1>St. Edwin</h1>  

<p>(&AElig;duini.)

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> King of Northumbria, born about 585, son of &AElig;lla, King of Deira, the southern division of Northumbria; died 12 October, 633. Upon &AElig;lla's death in 588, the sovereignty over both divisions of Northumbria was usurped by Ethebric of Bernicia, and retained at his death by his son Ethelfrid; Edwin, &AElig;lla's infant son, being compelled until his thirtieth year to wander from one friendly prince to another, in continual danger from Ethelfrid's attempts upon his life. Thus when he was residing with King Redwald of East Anglia, Ethelfrid repeatedly endeavoured to <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a> the latter to destroy him. Finally, however, Redwald's refusal to betray his guest led in 616 to a battle, fought upon the river Idle, in which Ethelfrid himself was slain, and Edwin was invited to the throne of Northumbria. On the death of his first wife, Edwin, in 625, asked for the hand of Ethelburga, sister to Eadbald, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> King of Kent, expressing his own readiness to embrace <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, if upon examination he should find it superior to his own religion. Ethelburga was accompanied to Northumbria by St. Paulinus, one of St. Augustine's fellow missionaries, who thus became its first apostle. By him Edwin was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at York in 627, and thenceforth showed himself most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the conversion of his people. In instance of this, <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> tells how, at their royal villa of Yeverin in Northumberland, the king and queen entertained Paulinus for five weeks, whilst he was occupied from morning to night in instructing and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> the crowds that flocked to him. By Edwin's persuasion, moreover, Eorpwald, King of East Anglia, son of his old friend Redwald, was led to become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. In token of his authority over the other kings of Bretwalda, Edwin used to have the <em>tufa</em> (a tuft of feathers on a spear, a military ensign of Roman origin) borne publicly before him, and he received tribute from the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> princes. Under him the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was so respected, that it became, as the <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> attests, a proverb that "a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> might travel through the island with a babe at her breast without fear of insult". St. Edwin was slain on 12 October, 633, in repelling an attack made on him by Penda, the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> King of Mercia, who, together with the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> prince Cadwallon (a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> only in name), had invaded his dominion. Perishing thus in conflict with the enemies of the Faith, he was regarded as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> and as such was allowed by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> to be depicted in the English College church at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His head was taken to St. Peter's church at <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, which he had begun. His body was conveyed to Whitby. Churches are said to have been dedicated to him at <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and at Breve in Somerset.
