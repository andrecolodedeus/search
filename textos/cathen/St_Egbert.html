<h1>St. Egbert</h1>  

<p>A Northumbrian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, born of noble <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parentage</a> c. 639; d. 729. In his youth he went for the sake of study to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, says the <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a>, "called Rathmelsigi", identified by some with Mellifont in what is now County Louth. There, when in danger of death from pestilence, he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for time to do penance, vowing amongst other things to live always in exile from his own country. In consequence he never returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, though he lived to the age of ninety, and always <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> rigorously. Having become a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he was filled with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the conversion of the still <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> German tribes related to the angles, and would himself have become their apostle, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had not shown him that his real calling was to other work. It was he, however, who dispatched to Friesland <a href="../cathen/15619b.htm">St. Wigbert</a>, <a href="../cathen/15645a.htm">St. Willibrord</a>, and other saintly missionaries. St. Egbert's own mission was made known to him by a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, who, at <a href="../cathen/10170a.htm">Melrose</a>, had been a disciple of <a href="../cathen/02625a.htm">St. Boisil</a>. Appearing to this <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, <a href="../cathen/02625a.htm">St. Boisil</a> sent him to tell Egbert that the Lord willed him instead of preaching to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> to go to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of St. Columba, "because their ploughs were not going straight", in consequence of their <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> practice in the celebration of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. Leaving <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> therefore in 716, Egbert crossed over to <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a>, where the last thirteen years of his life were spent. By his sweetness and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> he induced the <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to relinquish their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> mode of computation; in 729 they celebrated <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> with the rest of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> upon 24 April, although their old rule placed it that year upon an earlier day. On the same day, after saying <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> and joining joyfully in their celebration, the aged Egbert died. Though he is now <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> simply as a confessor, it is probable that St. Egbert was a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. By <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> he is expressly called <em>antistes</em> and <em>episcopus</em>, and an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> account of a synod at Birra names him "Egbert Bishop", whilst the term <em>sacerdos</em> used by the <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a>, is sometimes applied by him to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.
