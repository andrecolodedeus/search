<h1>St. Eimhin</h1>  

<p>Abbot and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ros-mic-Truin (<a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>), probably in the sixth century. He came of the royal race of Munster, and was brother of two other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, Culain and Dairmid. Of the early part of his <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> little is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. When he became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Ros-mic-Truin, in succession to its founder, <a href="../cathen/01007a.htm">St. Abban</a>, he had been apparently connected with one of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of the south of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, since it is recorded that a number of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> "followed the man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from his own country of Munster". Ros-mic-Truin lies in South Leinster on the bank of the River Barrow, and is distant only eight miles, by water, from the confines of Munster, at the point where the Suir and Barrow meet, and in confluence enter the Atlantic. Although the Abbey of Ros-mic-Truin was founded by <a href="../cathen/01007a.htm">St. Abban</a>, it is said to have been colonized by St. Eimhin, and from the number of religious and students belonging to the south of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> who dwelt there the place came to be called "Ros-glas of the Munstermen". St. Eimhin is said by some to have been the author of the life of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, called the "Vita Tripartita" (ed. Whitley Stokes in R.S.), originally published by Father <a href="../cathen/04099c.htm">John Colgan, O.S.F.</a> It contains a greater variety of details concerning the mission of the Apostle of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> than any other of the lives extant. St. Eimhin was famous for many and great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death has not been recorded; however competent authorities assign it to the earlier half of the sixth century. After St. Eimhin's death, it is said, his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> bell was held in great veneration, and was used as a swearing <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> down to the fourteenth century, <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a> and promises made upon it being deemed inviolable. Among the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the Royal Irish Academy, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, is a prose tract entitled "Caine Emine" (i.e. the tribute or rule of Eimhin), also a poem of several stanzas relating to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> bell. St. Eimhin is given in the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">calendars</a> on 22 December.
