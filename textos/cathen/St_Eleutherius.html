<h1>St. Eleutherius</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/06190a.htm">French</a> ELEUTHERE).

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a> at the beginning of the sixth century. Historically there is very little known about St. Eleutherius, but he was without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>. Theodore, whom some give as his immediate predecessor, was either a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, whose name was placed by mistake on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> list of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, or simply a missionary who ministered to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> scattered throughout the small <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>. Before he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Eleutherius lived at court with his friend Medardus, who predicted that he would attain the dignity of a count and also be elevated to the episcopate. After <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a>, King of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, had been <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, in 496, with more than 3000 of his subjects, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> took part in the royal councils. <a href="../cathen/12763b.htm">St. Remigius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, organized the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in Northern Gaul, and it is more than likely that St. Eleutherius was named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a> at this time.

<p>The saint's biography in its present form was really an invention of Henri of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a> in the twelfth century. According to this, Eleutherius was born at <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a> towards the end of the reign of Childeric, the father of <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a>, of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm#christian">Christian family</a> descended from <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by St. Piatus. His father's name was Terenus, and his mother's Blanda. Persecution by the tribune of the Scheldt <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to flee from <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a> and take refuge in the village of Blandinium. The conversion of <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a>, however, enabled the small community to reassemble and build at Blandinium a church, which was dedicated to St. Peter. Theodore was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, and Eleutherius succeeded him. Consulted by Pope Hormisdas as to the best means of eradicating the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which threatened nascent <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, Eleutherius convened a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> and publicly confounded the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. They vowed vengeance, and as he was on his way to the church, one day, they fell on him and, after beating him unmercifully, left him for dead. He recovered, however, but his days were numbered. On his death-bed (529) he confided his flock to his lifelong friend, <a href="../cathen/10115b.htm">St. Medardus</a>.

<p>The motive underlying this biography invented by Canon Henri (1141), was to prove the antiquity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, which from the end of the eleventh century had been trying to free itself from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Noyon. The sermons on the Trinity, Nativity, and the <a href="../cathen/01542a.htm">feast of the Annunciation</a> (Bibliotheca Patrum, vol. XV), sometimes attributed to St. Eleutherius, are also of a more than <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> authenticity. His cult, however, is well established; there is record of a recovery of his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> during the episcopate of Hedilo in 897 or 898, and a translation of them by Bishop Baudoin in 1064 or 1065, and another in 1247. <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">Relics</a> of this saint were also preserved in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Martin at <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is given in <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> on 20 or 21 July, but is usually celebrated on the former date. The translation of his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> is commemorated 25 August.
