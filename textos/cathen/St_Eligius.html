<h1>St. Eligius</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/06190a.htm">French</a> Eloi).

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Noyon-Tournai, born at Chaptelat near <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, c. 590, of Roman <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, Eucherius and Terrigia; died at Noyon, 1 December, 660. His father, recognizing unusual talent in his son, sent him to the noted goldsmith Abbo, master of the mint at <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>. Later Eligius went to Neustria, where he worked under Babo, the royal treasurer, on whose recommendation Clotaire II commissioned him to make a throne of gold adorned with precious stones. His honesty in this so pleased the king that he appointed him master of the mint at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, besides taking him into his household. After the death of Clotaire (629), Dagobert appointed his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> friend his chief councillor. The fame of Eligius spread rapidly, and ambassadors first paid their respects to him before going to the king. His success in inducing the Breton King, Judicail, to submit to <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> authority (636-37) increased his influence. Eligius took advantage of this to obtain <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> for the poor and to ransom Roman, <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gallic</a>, Breton, <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxon</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moorish</a> captives, who were arriving daily at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>. He founded several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and with the king's consent sent his servants through towns and villages to take down the bodies of malefactors who had been executed, and give them decent burial. Eligius was a source of edification at court, where he and his friend Dado (Audoenus) lived according to the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> monastic rule, introduced into Gaul by St. Columbanus. Eligius introduced this rule, either entirely or in part, into the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Solignac which he founded in 632, and into the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> where three hundred virgins were under the guidance of the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> Aurea. He also built the <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">basilica of St. Paul</a>, and restored that of <a href="../cathen/09721c.htm">St. Martial</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He erected several fine churches in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">Martin of Tours</a>, the national saint of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, and St. Denis, who was chosen <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> by the king. On the death of Dagobert (639), Queen Nanthilde took the reins of government, and Eligius and Dado left the court and entered the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. On the death of Acarius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Noyon-Tournai, 13 May, 640, Eligius was made his successor with the unanimous <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people. The inhabitants of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> were <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> for the most part. He undertook the conversion of the Flemings, Antwerpians, Frisians, Suevi, and the barbarian tribes along the coast. In 654 he approved the famous privilege granted to the Abbey of Saint-Denis, Paris, exempting it from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the ordinary. In his own episcopal city of Noyon he built and endowed a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for virgins. After the finding of the body of St. Quentin, Bishop Eligius erected in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> a church to which was joined a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> under the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> rule. He also discovered the bodies of St. Piatus and companions, and in 654 removed the remains of St Fursey, the celebrated <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> missionary (d. 650). Eligius was buried at Noyon. There is in existence a sermon written by Eligius, in which he combats the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> practices of his time, a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> on the last judgment, also a letter written in 645, in which he begs for the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of Bishop <a href="../cathen/04751a.htm">Desiderius of Cahors</a>. The fourteen other <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> attributed to him are of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> authenticity. His <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> have been edited by Krusch in "Mon. Germ. Hist." (loc. cit. infra).

<p>St. Eligius is particularly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, in the province of <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, and at <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, Courtrai of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were the object of special veneration, and were often transferred to other resting-places, thus in 881, 1066, 1137, 1255, and 1306. He is the patron of goldsmiths, blacksmiths, and all workers in metal. Cabmen have also put themselves under his protection. He is generally represented in <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> in the garb of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a> in his right hand, on the open palm of his left a miniature church of chased gold.
