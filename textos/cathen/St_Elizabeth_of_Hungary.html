<h1>St. Elizabeth of Hungary</h1>  

<p>Also called St. Elizabeth of <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>, born in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, probably at Pressburg, 1207; died at Marburg, <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, 17 November (<em>not</em> 19 November), 1231.

<p>She was a daughter of King Andrew II of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> (1205-35) and his wife Gertrude, a member of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Counts of Andechs-Meran; Elizabeth's brother succeeded his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> on the throne of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> as Bela IV; the sister of her mother, Gertrude, was <a href="../cathen/07189a.htm">St. Hedwig</a>, wife of Duke Heinrich I, the Bearded, of <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a>, while another <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, <a href="../cathen/05391a.htm">St. Elizabeth (Isabel) of Portugal</a> (d. 1336), the wife of the tyrannical King Diniz of that country, was her great-niece.

<p>In 1211 a formal embassy was sent by <a href="../cathen/07265b.htm">Landgrave Hermann I</a> of <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a> to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> to arrange, as was customary in that age, a marriage between his eldest son Hermann and Elizabeth, who was then four years old. This plan of a marriage was the result of political considerations and was intended to be the ratification of a great alliance which in the political schemes of the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> it was sought to form against the German <a href="../cathen/11357a.htm">Emperor Otto IV</a>, a member of the house of <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a>, who had quarrelled with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Not long after this the little girl was taken to the <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringian</a> court to be brought up with her future husband and, in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, to be <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to him.

<p>The court of <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a> was at this period famous for its magnificence. Its centre was the stately castle of the Wartburg, splendidly placed on a hill in the Thuringian Forest near Eisenach, where the <a href="../cathen/07265b.htm">Landgrave Hermann</a> lived surrounded by poets and minnesingers, to whom he was a generous patron. Notwithstanding the turbulence and purely secular life of the court and the pomp of her surroundings, the little girl grew up a very religious child with an evident inclination to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">pious observances</a> and small acts of <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">self-mortification</a>. These religious impulses were undoubtedly strengthened by the sorrowful experiences of her life.

<p>In 1213 Elizabeth's mother, Gertrude, was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> by <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungarian</a> nobles, probably out of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>. On 31 December, 1216, the oldest son of the <a href="../cathen/07265b.htm">landgrave</a>, Hermann, who Elizabeth was to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marry</a>, died; after this she was <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to Ludwig, the second son. It was probably in these years that Elizabeth had to suffer the hostility of the more frivolous members of the <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringian</a> court, to whom the <a href="../cathen/04329a.htm">contemplative</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> child was a constant rebuke. Ludwig, however, must have soon come to her protection against any ill-treatment. The legend that arose later is incorrect in making Elizabeth's mother-in-law, the Landgravine Sophia, a member of the reigning <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, the leader of this court party. On the contrary, Sophia was a very <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">religious</a> and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and a kindly mother to the little Elizabeth.

<p>The political plans of the old <a href="../cathen/07265b.htm">Landgrave Hermann</a> involved him in great difficulties and reverses; he was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, lost his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> towards the end of his life, and died, 25 April, 1217, unreconciled with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He was succeeded by his son Ludwig IV, who, in 1221, was also made regent of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a> and the East Mark. The same year (1221) Ludwig and Elizabeth were married, the groom being twenty-one years old and the bride fourteen. The marriage was in every regard a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> and exemplary one, and the couple were devotedly attached to each other. Ludwig proved himself worthy of his wife. He gave his protection to her acts of charity, penance, and her vigils, and often held Elizabeth's hands as she <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">knelt</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> at night beside his bed. He was also a capable ruler and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> soldier. The <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> call him St. Ludwig, an appellation given to him as one of the best men of his age and the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> husband of <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">St. Elizabeth</a>.

<p>They had three children: Hermann II (1222-41), who died young; Sophia (1224-84), who married Henry II, Duke of Brabant, and was the ancestress of the Landgraves of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, as in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringian</a> succession she won <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a> for her son Heinrich I, called the Child; Gertrude (1227-97), Elizabeth's third child, was born several weeks after the death of her father; in after-life she became <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Altenberg near Wetzlar.

<p>Shortly after their marriage, Elizabeth and Ludwig made a journey to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>; Ludwig was often after this employed by the <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a>, to whom he was much attached, in the affairs of the empire. In the spring of 1226, when floods, famine, and the pest wrought havoc in <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>, Ludwig was in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> attending the Diet at <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a> on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">emperor</a> and the empire. Under these circumstances Elizabeth assumed control of affairs, distributed <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> in all parts of the territory of her husband, giving even state robes and ornaments to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>. In order to care personally for the unfortunate she built below the Wartburg a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> with twenty-eight beds and visited the inmates daily to attend to their wants; at the same <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> she aided nine hundred <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> daily. It is this period of her life that has preserved Elizabeth's fame to posterity as the gentle and charitable ch&eacute;telaine of the Wartburg. Ludwig on his return confirmed all she had done. The next year (1227) he started with the <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a> on a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> to Palestine but died, 11 September of the same year at <a href="../cathen/11351c.htm">Otranto</a>, from the pest. The news did not reach Elizabeth until October, just after she had given birth to her third child. On hearing the tidings Elizabeth, who was only twenty years old, cried out: "The world with all its joys is now dead to me."

<p>The fact that in 1221 the followers of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a> (d. 1226) made their first permanent settlement in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> was one of great importance in the later career of Elizabeth. Brother Rodeger, one of the first <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> whom the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> for <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Caesarius of Speier, received into the order, was for a time the <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual instructor</a> of Elizabeth at the Wartburg; in his teachings he unfolded to her the ideals of St. Francis, and these strongly appealed to her. With the aid of Elizabeth the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> in 1225 founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in Eisenach; Brother Rodeger, as his fellow-companion in the order, <a href="../cathen/08502a.htm">Jordanus</a>, reports, instructed Elizabeth, to observe, according to her state of life, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, patience, the exercise of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and charity. Her position prevented the attainment of the other ideal of St. Francis, <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and complete poverty. Various remarks of Elizabeth to her <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> attendants make it clear how ardently she desired the life of poverty.

<p>After a while the post Brother Rodeger had filled was assumed by <a href="../cathen/04259b.htm">Master Conrad of Marburg</a>, who belonged to no order, but was a very ascetic and, it must be acknowledged, a somewhat rough and very severe man. He was well known as a preacher of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> and also as an <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">inquisitor</a> or judge in cases of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. On account of the latter activity he has been more severely judged than is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>; at the present day, however, the estimate of him is a fairer one. <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Pope Gregory IX</a>, who wrote at times to Elizabeth, recommended her himself to the God-fearing preacher. <a href="../cathen/04259b.htm">Conrad</a> treated Elizabeth with inexorable severity, even using corporal means of correction; nevertheless, he brought her with a firm hand by the road of <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">self-mortification</a> to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, and after her death was very active in her <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>. Although he forbade her to follow St. Francis in complete poverty as a beggar, yet, on the other hand, by the command to keep her <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dower</a> she was enabled to perform works of <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charity</a> and tenderness.

<p>Up to 1888 it was <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, on account of the testimony of one of Elizabeth's servants in the process of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>, that Elizabeth was driven from the Wartburg in the winter of 1227 by her brother-in-law, Heinrich Raspe, who acted as regent for her son, then only five years old. About 1888 various investigators (B&ouml;rner, Mielke, Wenck, E. Michael, etc.) asserted that Elizabeth left the Wartburg <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>, the only compulsion being a <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> one. She was not able at the castle to follow <a href="../cathen/04259b.htm">Conrad's</a> command to eat only food obtained in a way that was certainly right and proper. Lately, however, Huyskens (1907) tried to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that Elizabeth was driven from the castle at Marburg in <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, which was hers by <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dower</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a>. Consequently, the <a href="../cathen/14468c.htm">Te Deum</a> that she directed the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> to sing on the night of her expulsion would have been sung in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Marburg. Accompanied by two <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> attendants, Elizabeth left the castle that stands on a height commanding Marburg. The next day her children were brought to her, but they were soon taken elsewhere to be cared for.

<p>Elizabeth's aunt, Matilda, <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> of Kitzingen near <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, took charge of the unfortunate landgravine and sent her to her uncle Eckbert, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, however, was intent on arranging another marriage for her, although during the lifetime of her husband Elizabeth had made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> in case of his death; the same <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> had also been taken by her attendants.

<p>While Elizabeth was maintaining her position against her uncle the remains of her husband were brought to <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> by his faithful followers who had carried them from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Weeping bitterly, she <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> the body in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> vault of the landgraves of <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Reinhardsbrunn. With the aid of <a href="../cathen/04259b.htm">Conrad</a> she now received the value of her <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dower</a> in money, namely two thousand marks; of this sum she divided five hundred marks in one day among the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>. On <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>, 1228, in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> house at Eisenach Elizabeth formally renounced the world; then going to <a href="../cathen/04259b.htm">Master Conrad</a> at Marburg, she and her maids received from him the dress of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">St. Francis</a>, thus being among the first <a href="../cathen/14520b.htm">tertiaries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. In the summer of 1228 she built the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at Marburg and on its completion devoted herself entirely to the care of the sick, especially to those afflicted with the most loathsome diseases. <a href="../cathen/04259b.htm">Conrad of Marburg</a> still imposed many self-mortifications and spiritual renunciations, while at the same <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> he even took from Elizabeth her devoted domestics. Constant in her devotion to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Elizabeth's strength was consumed by her charitable labours, and she passed away at the age of twenty-four, a <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> when life to most <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human beings</a> is just opening.

<p>Very soon after the death of Elizabeth <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> began to be worked at her <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">grave</a> in the church of the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, especially <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of healing. <a href="../cathen/04259b.htm">Master Conrad</a> showed great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in advancing the process of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>. By <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> command three examinations were held of those who had been healed: namely, in August, 1232, January, 1233, and January, 1235. Before the process reached its end, however, <a href="../cathen/04259b.htm">Conrad</a> was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a>, 30 July, 1233. But the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a> in 1233 founded a house at Marburg, and in November, 1234, Conrad, Landgrave of <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>, the brother-in-law of Elizabeth, entered the order. At Pentecost (28 May) of the year 1235, the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of the "greatest <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of the German <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>" was celebrated by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, Landgrave Conrad being present. In August of the same year (1235) the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of the beautiful <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> church of St. Elizabeth was laid at Marburg; on 1 May, 1236, <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a> attended the taking-up of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">body</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>; in 1249 the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">remains</a> were placed in the <a href="../cathen/03693a.htm">choir</a> of the church of St. Elizabeth, which was not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> until 1283.

<p><a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">Pilgrimages</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">grave</a> soon increased to such importance that at times they could be compared to those to the shrine of <a href="../cathen/04187b.htm">Santiago de Compostela</a>. In 1539 Philip the Magnanimous, Landgrave of Hesse, who had become a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, put an end to the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> by unjustifiable interference with the church that belonged to the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a> and by forcibly removing the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> and all that was sacred to Elizabeth. Nevertheless, the entire German people still <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the "dear St. Elizabeth" as she is called; in 1907 a new impulse was given to her veneration in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> by the celebration of the seven hundredth anniversary of her birth.

<p>St. Elizabeth is generally represented as a princess graciously giving <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to the wretched <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> or as holding roses in her lap; in the latter case she is portrayed either alone or as surprised by her husband, who, according to a legend, which is, however, related of other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> as well, met her unexpectedly as she went secretly on an errand of mercy, and, so the story runs, the bread she was trying to conceal was suddenly turned into roses.

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The original materials for the life of St. Elizabeth are to be found in the letters sent by CONRAD OF MARBURG to Pope Gregory IX (1232) and in the testimony of her four female attendants (<em>Libellus de dictis quatuor ancillarum</em>) taken by the third papal commission (January, 1235).
