<h1>St. Elizabeth of Portugal</h1>  

<p>Queen (sometimes known as the PEACEMAKER); born in 1271; died in 1336. She was named after her great-aunt, the great <a href="../cathen/05389a.htm">Elizabeth of Hungary</a>, but is known in Portuguese history by the Spanish form of that name, Isabel. The daughter of Pedro III, King of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, and Constantia, grandchild of <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a>, she was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> very piously, and led a life of strict regularity and self-denial from her childhood: she said the full <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> daily, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> and did other penances, and gave up amusement. Elizabeth was married very early to Diniz (Denis), King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, a poet, and known as <em>Rei Lavrador</em>, or the working king, from his hard work in is country's service. His <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, however, were extremely bad, and the court to which his young wife was brought consequently most corrupt. Nevertheless, Elizabeth quietly pursued the regular religious practices of her maidenhood, whilst doing her best to win her husband's affections by gentleness and extraordinary forbearance. She was devoted to the poor and sick, and gave every moment she could spare to helping them, even pressing her court ladies into their service. Naturally, such a life was a reproach to many around her, and caused ill will in some quarters. A popular story is told of how her husband's jealousy was roused by an evil-speaking page; of how he condemned the queen's supposed guilty accomplice to a cruel death; and was finally convinced of her innocence by the strange accidental substitution of her accuser for the intended victim.

<p>Diniz does not appear to have reformed in <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> till late in life, when we are told that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> won him to repentance by her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and unfailing sweetness. They had two children, a daughter Constantia and a son Affonso. The latter so greatly resented the favours shown to the king's <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> sons that he rebelled, and in 1323 <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was declared between him and his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. St. Elizabeth, however, rode in person between the opposing armies, and so reconciled her husband and son. Diniz died in 1325, his son succeeding him as Affonso IV. St. Elizabeth then retired to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a> which she had founded at <a href="../cathen/04095b.htm">Coimbra</a>, where she took the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Tertiary habit, wishing to devote the rest of her life to the poor and sick in obscurity. But she was called forth to act once more as peacemaker. In 1336 Affonso IV marched his troops against the King of Castile, to whom he had married his daughter Maria, and who had neglected and ill-treated her. In spite of age and weakness, the holy queen dowager insisted on hurrying to Estremoz, where the two king's armies were drawn up. She again stopped the fighting and caused terms of peace to be arranged. But the exertion brought on her final illness; and as soon as her mission was fulfilled she died of a fever, full of heavenly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and exhorting her son to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and peace. St. Elizabeth was buried at <a href="../cathen/04095b.htm">Coimbra</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> followed her death. She was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> in 1625, and her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 8 July.
