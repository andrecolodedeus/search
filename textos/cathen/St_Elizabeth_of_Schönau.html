<h1>St. Elizabeth of Sch&ouml;nau</h1>  

<p>Born about 1129; d. 18 June, 1165.-Feast 18 June. She was born of an obscure <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, entered the <a href="../cathen/10452a.htm">double monastery</a> of Sch&ouml;nau in Nassau at the age of twelve, received the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> habit, made her profession in 1147, and in 1157 was superioress of the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> under the Abbot Hildelin. After her death she was buried in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church of St. Florin. When her writings were published the name of saint was added. She was never formally <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>, but in 1584 her name was entered in the Roman Martyrology and has remained there.

<p>Given to works of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> from her youth, much afflicted with bodily and <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> suffering, a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> observer of the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a> and of the regulation of her <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, and devoted to practices of <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, Elizabeth was favoured, from 1152, with <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasies</a> and visions of various kinds. These generally occurred on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and Holy Days at Mass or <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> or after hearing or reading the lives of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, His Blessed Mother, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, or the special saint of the day would appear to her and instruct her; or she would see quite realistic representations of the Passion, <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>, or other scenes of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a> and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testaments</a>. What she saw and heard she put down on wax tablets. Her <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Hildelin, told her to relate these things to her brother Egbert (Eckebert), then <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of Bonn. At first she hesitated fearing lest she be deceived or be looked upon as a deceiver; but she obeyed. Egbert (who became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Sch&ouml;nau in 1155 and succeeded Hildelin as second <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>) put everything in writing, later arranged the material at leisure, and then published all under his sister's name.

<p>Thus came into existence <ul> <li>three books of "Visions". Of these the first is written in language very simple and in unaffected style, so that it may easily pass as the work of Elizabeth. The other two are more elaborate and replete with <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> terminology, so that they show more of the work of Egbert than of Elizabeth. <li>"Liber viarum Dei". This seems to be an imitation of the "Scivias" (<em>scire vias Domini</em>) of St. Hildegarde of Bingen, her friend and correspondent. It contains admonitions to all classes of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, to the married and unmarried. Here the influence of Egbert is very plain. She utters prophetic threats of judgment against <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who are unfaithful shepherds of the flock of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, against the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> and worldliness of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who only wear the garb of poverty and self-denial, against the vices of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, and against <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and superiors delinquent in their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>; she urges all to combat earnestly the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">Cathari</a>; she declares <a href="../cathen/15411a.htm">Victor IV</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> supported by Frederick against <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, as the one chosen of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. All of this appears in Egbert's own writings. <li>The revelation on the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/15225d.htm">St. Ursula</a> and her companions. This is full of fantastic exaggerations and anachronisms, but has become the foundation of the subsequent Ursula legends. </ul> There is a great diversity of opinion in regard to her revelations. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has never passed sentence upon them nor even examined them. Elizabeth herself was convinced of their <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> character, as she states in a letter to Hildegarde; her brother held the same opinion; <a href="../cathen/15062a.htm">Trithemius</a> considers them genuine; <a href="../cathen/01434a.htm">Eusebius Amort</a> (De revelationibus visionibus et apparitionibus privatis regulae tutae, etc., Augsburg, 1744) holds them to be nothing more than what Elizabeth's own <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> could produce, or illusions of the devil, since in some things they disagree with history and with other revelations (Acta SS., Oct, IX, 81). A complete edition of her writings was made by F.W.E. Roth (Brunn, 1884); translations appeared in Italian (Venice, 1859), French (Tournai, 1864), and in <a href="../cathen/07615b.htm">Icelandic</a> (1226-1254).
