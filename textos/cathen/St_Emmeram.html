<h1>St. Emmeram</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> and missionary to <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> in the first half of the seventh century; <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at Ascheim (Bavaria) towards the end of the same century. Of a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Aquitaine, he received a good <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. According to some authors Emmeram occupied the <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">See of Poitiers</a>, but this cannot be verified, for his name does not appear among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>. He probably held the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> for a short time, from the death of Dido (date unknown) to the episcopate of Ansoaldus (674). Having heard that the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> were still <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolaters</a>, he determined to carry the light of the Faith to them. Ascending the Loire, crossing the Black Forest, and going down the Danube, he reached <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> in a region then governed by the Duke Theodo. For three years he laboured in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, preaching and converting the people, acquiring also a renown for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. He then turned his steps towards <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to visit the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of Sts. Peter and Paul, but after a five days' Journey, at a place now called Kleinhelfendorf, south of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, he was set upon by envoys of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> who tortured him cruelly. He died shortly afterwards at Ascheim, about fifteen miles distant. The cause of this attack and the circumstances attending his death are not known. According to the legend related by Aribo, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Freising, the first to write a life of St. Emmeram, Ota, daughter of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, who had been seduced by Sigipaldus, an important personage of her father's court, fearing her father's wrath, confessed her fault to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Moved with compassion, he advised her to name himself, whom every one respected, as her seducer, and it was in consequence of this accusation that Theodo ordered him to be followed and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. The improbability of the tale, the details of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, which are certainly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>, and the fantastic account of the prodigies attending his death show that the writer, infected by the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> mania of his time, simply added to the facts imaginary details supposed to redound to the glory of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>.

<p>All that is known as to the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> death is that it took place on 22 September, some time before <a href="../cathen/13229a.htm">St. Rupert's</a> arrival in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (696). At Kleinhelfendorf, where he was tortured, there stands today a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Emmeram, and at Ascheim, where he died, is also a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> built in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. His remains were removed to <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. George, from which they were transferred about the middle of the eighth century by Bishop Gawibaldus to a church dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. This church having been destroyed by fire in 1642, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> body was found under the altar in 1645 and was encased in a magnificent <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, which were canonically recognized by Bishop Ignaz de Senestrez in 1833, are exposed for the veneration of the faithful every year on 22 September. It is impossible to prove that Emmeram occupied the <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">See of Ratisbon</a>, for the official <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> list begins with the above-mentioned Gawibaldus, who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> in 739 and died in 764.
