<h1>St. Erconwald</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, died about 690. He belonged to the princely <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the East Anglian <a href="../cathen/11215c.htm">Offa</a>, and devoted a considerable portion of his patrimony to founding two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, one for <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> at Chertsey, and the other for <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> at Barking in Essex. Over the latter he placed hiss sister, St. Ethelburga, as <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>. He himself discharged the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of superior at Chertsey. Erconwald continued his monastic life till the death of Bishop Wini in 675, when he was called to the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">See of London</a>, at the instance of King Sebbi and <a href="../cathen/14571a.htm">Theodore</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. As <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> he was renowned for his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of life, and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were wrought in attestation of his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. The sick were cured by contact with the litter on which he had been carried; this we have on the testimony of <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a>. He was present in 686 at the reconciliation between <a href="../cathen/14571a.htm">Archbishop Theodore</a> and Wilfrith. King Ini in the preface to his <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> calls Erconwald "my <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>". During his episcopate he enlarged his church, augmented its revenues, and obtained for it special <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privileges</a> from the king.

<p>According to an ancient epitaph, Erconwald ruled the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">Diocese of London</a> for eleven years. He is said to have eventually retired to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of his sister in Barking, where he died 30 April. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in St. Paul's, and his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> became renowned for <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. The citizens of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> had a special devotion to him, and they regarded with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> the magnificence of his shrine. During the burning of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in 1087 it is related that the shrine and its silken coverings remained intact. A <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> translation of St. Erconwald's body took place 14 Nov., 1148, when it was raised above the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>. The shrine was robbed of its jewels and ornaments in the sixteenth century; and the bones of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> are said to have been then buried at the east end of the choir. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is observed by <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> on 14 November. Prior to the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, the anniversaries of St. Erconwald's death and translation of his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were observed at St. Paul's as feasts of the first class, according to an ordinance of Bishop Braybroke in 1386.
