<h1>St. Erhard of Ratisbon</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of that city in the seventh century, probably identical with an Abbot Erhard of Ebersheimmunster mentioned in a Merovingian diploma of 684. Ancient documents call him also Erard and Herhard. The legendary account of his life offers little that is historically certain. The following, however, seems reliable. Erhard was born in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, then known as "Scotia". Like many of his countrymen he went to the Continent as missionary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopus</a>, and coming to the Vosges met there St. Hildulf, said to have been <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and who lived there as a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> (666-671). He is called Erhard's brother, but very likely spiritual relationship was meant. It is said that each of them founded seven <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Thence Erhard went to <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> and founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> of Niedermunster. By <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">Divine inspiration</a> he was recalled to the Rhineland to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> <a href="../cathen/11207b.htm">St. Odilia</a>, blind from her birth, but who received her eyesight at her <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. He sent a messenger to her father, Duke Attich, and reconciled him with his disowned daughter. According to another account, <a href="../cathen/11207b.htm">St. Odilia</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by Hildulf, Erhard acting as her sponsor. The year of his death is not known. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the still-extant Erhard-crypt at Niedermunster, and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were wrought at his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">grave</a>, that was guarded in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> by "Erhardinonnen", a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who observed there a perpetual round of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a>, in 974, made donations of properties in the Danube valley to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> "where the holy confessor Erhard rests". On 7 Oct., 1052 the remains of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Erhard and Wolfgang were raised by <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Pope St. Leo IX</a> in presence of <a href="../cathen/07228a.htm">Emperor Henry III</a> and many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> which was at that time equivalent to <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>. <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> documents, however, mention only the raising of Wolfgang, not that of Erhard. At the close of the eleventh century, Paul von Bernried, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, at the suggestion of <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> Heilika of Niedermunster, wrote a life of Erhard and added a second book containing a number of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. The learned canon of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, Conrad of Megenberg (d. 1374), furnished a new edition of this work. The church in Neidermunster, now a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, still preserves the <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, made of black buffalo-horn. A bone of his skull was enclosed in a precious receptacle in 1866 and is placed upon the heads of the faithful on his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a>, 8 Jan. Three ancient Latin lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> are found in the Acta Sanctorum (8 Jan). The beautiful <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> is reproduced in Jakob, "Die Kunst im Dienste der Kirche" (illust. 16).
