<h1>St. Etheldreda</h1>  

<p>Queen of Northumbria; born (probably) about 630; died at <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>, 23 June, 679. While still very young she was given in marriage by her father, Anna, King of East Anglia, to a certain Tonbert, a subordinate prince, from whom she received as morning gift a tract of land locally known as the Isle of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>. She never lived in wedlock with Tonbert, however, and for five years after his early death was left to foster her vocation to religion. Her father then arranged for her a marriage of political convenience with <a href="../cathen/05327a.htm">Egfrid</a>, son and heir to Oswy, King of Northumbria. From this second bridegroom, who is said to have been only fourteen years of age, she received certain lands at <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Hexham</a>; through <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a> of York she gave these lands to found the minster of St. Andrew. <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a> was her friend and spiritual guide, but it was to him that <a href="../cathen/05327a.htm">Egfrid</a>, on succeeding his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, appealed for the enforcement of his marital <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> as against Etheldreda's <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">religious vocation</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> succeeded at first in persuading <a href="../cathen/05327a.htm">Egfrid</a> to consent that Etheldreda should live for some time in peace as a sister of the Coldingham <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a>, founded by her aunt, St. Ebba, in what is now Berwickshire. But at last the imminent danger of being forcibly carried off by the king drove her to wander southwards, with only two <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in attendance. They made their way to Etheldreda's own estate of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>, not, tradition said, without the interposition of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and, on a spot hemmed in by morasses and the waters of the Ouse, the foundation of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a> Minster was begun. This region was Etheldreda's native home, and her royal East Anglian relatives gave her the material means <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the execution of her holy design. <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a> had not yet returned from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he had obtained extraordinary privileges for her foundation from <a href="../cathen/02427d.htm">Benedict II</a>, when she died of a plague which she herself, it is said, had circumstantially foretold. Her body was, throughout many succeeding centuries, an object of devout veneration in the famous church which grew up on her foundation. (See <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">ANCIENT DIOCESE OF ELY</a>.) One hand of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> is now <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the church of St. Etheldreda, Ely Place, London, which enjoys the distinction of being the first&mdash;and at present (1909) the only&mdash;pre-Reformation church in Great Britain restored to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship. Built in the thirteenth century as a private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> attached to the town residence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>, the structure of St. Etheldreda's passed through many vicissitudes during the centuries following its <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecration</a>, until, in 1873-74, it was purchased by Father William Lockhart and occupied by the Institute of Charity, of whose English mission Father Lockhart was then superior.
