<h1>St. Eucharius</h1>  

<p>First <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> (Treves) in the second half of the third century. According to an ancient legend, he was one of the seventy-two disciples of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and was sent to Gaul by St. Peter as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, together with the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Valerius and the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> Maternus, to preach the Gospel. They came to the Rhine and to Elegia (Ehl) in Alsace, where Maternus died. His two companions hastened back to St. Peter and begged him to restore the dead man to life. St. Peter gave his <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">pastoral staff</a> to Eucharius, and, upon being touched with it, Maternus, who had been in his grave for forty days, returned to life. The <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were then converted in large numbers. After founding many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> the three companions went to <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> where the work of evangelization progressed so rapidly that Eucharius chose that city for his episcopal residence. Among other <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> related in the legend he raised a dead <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to life. An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> announced to him his approaching death and pointed out Valerius as his successor. Eucharius died 8 Dec., having been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for twenty-five years, and was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. John outside the city. Valerius was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for fifteen years and was succeeded by Maternus, who had in the meantime founded the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Cologne and Tongres, being <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> altogether for forty years. The staff of St. Peter, with which he had been raised to life, was preserved at Cologne till the end of the tenth century when the upper half was presented to <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and was afterwards taken to Prague by Emperor Charles IV.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> it was believed that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> used no <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crozier</a>, because St. Peter had sent his episcopal staff to St. Eucharius; <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> concurs in this opinion (De Sacrif. Miss&aelig;, I, 62). The same instance, however, is related of several other alleged disciples of St. Peter, and more recent criticism interprets the staff as the distinctive mark of an envoy, especially of a missionary. Missionaries in subsequent centuries, e.g. <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, were occasionally called ambassadors of St. Peter, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> who sent them being the successor of Peter. Moreover, in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a> the foundation of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was often referred to as early a date as possible, in order thereby to increase its reputation, perhaps also its <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> gloried in Dionysius Areopagita as its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; similarly ancient origins were claimed by other <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. In time, especially through the ravages of the Normans, the more reliable earlier accounts were lost. When at a later period the lives of primitive holy founders, e.g. the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of ancient <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, came to be written anew, the gaps in tradition were filled out with various combinations and fanciful legends. In this way there originated in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Matthias near <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> the famous chronicle of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> (Gesta Treverorum, ed. Waitz in Mon. Germ. Hist.; script., VIII, 111-174) in which there is a curious mixture of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. It contains the account of the life of St. Eucharius given above. An amplification thereof, containing the lives of the three <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in question, is said to have been written by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Goldscher or Golscher, who lived in that <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> about the year 1130. From the "Gesta" the narrative passed unchallenged into numerous <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> works. More recent criticism has detected many contradictions and inaccuracies in these ancient records, and it is almost universally believed at present that, with few exceptions, the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missionaries came to <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> then belonged, not earlier than about 250. Following <a href="../cathen/07463a.htm">Hontheim</a>, <a href="../cathen/03189a.htm">Calmet</a> and others, the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>, with Marx, <a href="../cathen/09463a.htm">L&uuml;tolf</a>, and other historians refer these <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> to a period following 250, though not all of them consider this as fully established. The feast of St. Eucharius is celebrated on 8 Dec.
