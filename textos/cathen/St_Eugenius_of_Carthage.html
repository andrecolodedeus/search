<h1>St. Eugenius of Carthage</h1>  

<p>Unanimously elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> in 480 to succeed Deogratias (d. 456); d. 13 July, 505. The election was deferred owing to the opposition of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandal</a> kings and was only permitted by Huneric at the instance of Zeno and Placidia, into whose <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> had married. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> wise government, charity to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, austerity of life, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> under <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, won the admiration of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. In his uncompromising defence of the Divinity of the Word he was imitated by the members of his flock, many of whom were exiled with him, after he had admitted <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, contrary to royal edict, and had worsted in argument <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, whom the king pitted against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Both sides claimed the name "Catholic", the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> calling their opponents "Homoousians". The conference was held some time between 481 and February, 484, and ended by the withdrawal of the chief <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on the plea that he could not speak Latin. The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> being enraged, Huneric <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, exiling forty-six <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>, and three hundred and two to the African <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">deserts</a>. Among the latter was Eugenius, who under the custody of a ruffian named Antonius dwelt in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Tripoli. On setting out he wrote a letter of consolation and exhortation to the faithful of Carthage which is still extant in the works of <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> (P.L., LVII, 769-71). Gunthamund, who succeeded Huneric allowed Eugenius to return to Carthage and permitted him to reopen the churches. After eight years of peace Thrasamund succeeded to the throne, revived the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, arrested Eugenius, and condemned him to death, but commuted the sentence into exile at Vienne, near Albi (Languedoc), where the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> Alaric was king. Eugenius built here a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> over the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Amaranthus, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, and led a penitential life till his death. He is said to have <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> cured a man who was blind.

<p>He wrote: "Expositio Fidei Catholicae", demanded of him by Huneric, probably the one submitted by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at the conference. It proves the <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">consubstantiality</a> of the Word and Divinity of the Holy Ghost. He wrote also an "Apologeticus pro Fide"; "Altercatio cum Arianis", fragments of which are quoted by Victor de Vita; also pleas for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, addressed to Huneric or his successors. His letter to the faithful of Carthage has been mentioned above.
