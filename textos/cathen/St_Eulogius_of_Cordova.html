<div id="springfield2">
<h1>St. Eulogius of Cordova</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> and writer who flourished during the reigns of the Cordovan Caliphs, Abd-er-Rahman II and Mohammed I (822-886). It is not certain on what date or in what year of the ninth century he was born; it must have been previous to 819, because in 848 he was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> highly esteemed among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Catalonia and Navarre, and <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> was then conferred only on men thirty years of age. The <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was of the nobility and held land in Cordova from Roman times. The <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> rulers of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, at the beginning of the eighth century, tolerated the creed of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and left them, with some restrictions, their civil rule, <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, but made them feel the burden of subjection in the shape of pecuniary exactions and military service. In the large cities like Toledo and Cordova, the civil rule of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> did not differ from that of the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> epoch. The government was exercised by the <em>comes</em> (count), president of the council of senators, among whom we meet a similarly named ancestor of Eulogius. The saint, like his five brothers, received an excellent <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in accord with his good birth and under the guardianship of his mother Isabel. The youngest of the brothers, Joseph, held a high office in the palace of Abd-er-Rahman II; two other brothers, Alvarus and Isidore, were merchants and traded on a large scale as far as Central <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Of his sisters, Niola and Anulona, the first remained with her mother; the second was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> from infancy in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> where she later became a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>.

<p>After completing his studies in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Zoilus, Eulogius continued to live with his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> the better to care for his mother; also, perhaps, to study with famous masters, one of whom was Abbot Speraindeo, an illustrious writer of that time. In the meantime he found a friend in the celebrated Alvarus Paulus, a fellow-student, and they cultivated together all branches of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, sacred and profane, within their reach. Their correspondence in prose and verse filled volumes; later they agreed to destroy it as too exuberant and lacking in polish. Alvarus married, but Eulogius preferred the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> career, and was finally <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by Bishop Recared of <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>. Alvarus has left us a portrait of his friend: "Devoted", he says, "from his infancy to the Scriptures, and growing daily in the practice of virtue, he quickly reached perfection, surpassed in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> all his contemporaries, and became the teacher even of his masters. Mature in intelligence, though in body a child, he excelled them all in <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> even more than they surpassed him in years. Fair in feature [<em>clarus vultu</em>], honest and honourable, he shone by his eloquence, and yet more by his works. What books escaped his avidity for reading? What works of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers, of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, chiefly <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>? Poets, historians, rare writings, all kinds of books, especially sacred <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, in the composition of which he was a master, were read and digested by him; his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> was none the less remarkable and he readily yielded to the judgment of others less learned than himself." This <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> shone particularly on two occasions. In his youth he had decided to make a foot <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; notwithstanding his great fervour and his devotion to the sepulchre of the Prince of the Apostles (a notable <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the union of the Mozarabic Church with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>), he gave up his project, yielding to the advice of prudent friends. Again, during the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracenic</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, in 850, after reading a passage of the works of <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> he decided to refrain for a time from saying <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> that he might better defend the cause of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; however, at the request of his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Saul of <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>, he put aside his scruples. His extant writings are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that Alvarus did not exaggerate. They give an account of what is most important from 848 to 859 in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, both without and within the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> dominions, especially of the lives of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who suffered during the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracenic</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, <em>quorum para ipse magna fuit</em>. He was elected <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo shortly before he was beheaded (11 March, 859). He left a perfect account of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which he defended, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> culture which he propagated, the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> and sufferings which he endured; in a word, his writings show that he followed to the letter the exhortation of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>: <em>Imitatores mei estote sicut et ego Christi</em>. He is buried in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/11363a.htm">Oviedo</a>.
