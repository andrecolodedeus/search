<h1>St. Eusebius</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13422a.htm">Samosata</a> (now Samsat) in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>; <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown: d. in 379 or 380. History makes no mention of him before the year 361, when as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13422a.htm">Samosata</a>, he took part in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of St. Meletius, the newly elected <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. Just then the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> was rent by <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> and its affiliated <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. Most of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> were occupied by <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and Meletius himself was elected <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> only because the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> believed him to be a supporter of their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. <a href="../cathen/14724b.htm">Tillemont</a> and a few other historians even maintain that Eusebius was at that time leaning towards <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>. Whatever might have been the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Eusebius previously, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that at the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held in Antioch in 363 the Nicene formula, with express mention of <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousios</a></em>, was accepted, and the document was signed by Eusebius and twenty-four other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<p>When the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> discovered that Meletius upheld the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Nicene Council, they declared his election invalid and attempted to obtain from Eusebius, to whom they had been entrusted, the synodal acts proving the lawfulness of the election. The emperor Constantius, who supported the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, ordered Eusebius to surrender the document, but without success. Thereupon Constantius threatened Eusebius with the loss of his right hand, but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> calmly presented both of his hands to the bearer of the message, saying: "Strike them both off. I will not surrender the document by which the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>." The emperor was struck by the constancy of Eusebius and left the document in his possession.

<p>It was chiefly due to the concerted efforts of St. Eusebius and <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a> that, in 370, <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> was elected <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03133b.htm">C&#230;sarea</a> in Cappadocia. From this time also dates the tender friendship between St. Eusebius and the last-named Father, which is attested to by some still extant letters written by St. Basil to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Samasota. Eusebius displayed his greatest activity during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> emperor <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a>. Disguised as a military officer, he visited the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> Churches of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Phoenecia, and Palestine, exhorting the afflicted <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to remain faithful to their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, ordaining <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> where they were needed, and in many other ways assisting the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the difficult exercise of their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> during these troublesome times. It is on account of this untiring <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Eusebius that <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a> calls him "A pillar of the Church", "a gift of God", "a rule of faith", etc. (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G., XXI, 57). Incensed at the great success of Eusebius, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> prevailed upon the emperor <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> to banish him into Thrace. After the death of <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> in 378, he was allowed to return to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. On his journey from Thrace to Samosata he was instrumental in the appointment of numerous <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, among whom were Acacius at <a href="../cathen/02513b.htm">Beroea</a>, Theodotus at <a href="../cathen/07322a.htm">Hierapolis</a>, Isidore at <a href="../cathen/04597a.htm">Cyrrhus</a>, and Eulogius at <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>. Having returned to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, he resumed his former activity against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, both in his own diocese and in the neighbouring churches. While he was taking part in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of Bishop Maris, at the little town of Dolicha, near <a href="../cathen/13422a.htm">Samosata</a>, an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> struck him on the head with a tile thrown from the roof of her house. He died of this wound a few days later. The Greeks <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> him as a Martyr on the 21st of June, the Latins on the 22nd.
