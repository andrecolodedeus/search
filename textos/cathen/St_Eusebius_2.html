<h1>St. Eusebius</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; d. 357(?). He was a Roman patrician and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and is mentioned with distinction in Latin <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a>. The ancient genuine <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> of Usuard styles him confessor at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> emperor Constantius and adds that he was buried in the cemetery of Callistus. Some later <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> call him a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>.

<p>The "Acta Eusebii", discovered in 1479 by Mombritius and reproduced by <a href="../cathen/02242a.htm">Baluze</a> in his "Miscellanea" (1678-1715), tell the following story: When <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Pope Liberius</a> was permitted by Constantius to return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, supposedly at the price of his <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, by subscribing to the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> formula of <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a>, Eusebius, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, an ardent defender of the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a>, publicly preached against both <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and emperor, branding them as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> party who supported the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> Felix were excluded from all the churches, Eusebius continued to hold Divine service in his own house. He was arrested and brought before <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a> and Constantius. Here he boldly reproved <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a> for deserting the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. In consequence he was placed in a dungeon, four feet wide (or was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in his own house), where he spent his time in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and died after seven months. His body was buried in the cemetery of Callistus with the simple inscription: "Eusebio homini Dei". This act of kindness was performed by two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, Gregory and Orosius, friends of Eusebius. Gregory was put into the same <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and also died there. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> by Orosius, who professes to be the writer of the Acts.

<p>It is generally admitted that these Acts were a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> either entirely or at least in part, and written in the same spirit if not by the same hand, as the notice on <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> and <a href="../cathen/14724b.htm">Tillemont</a> point out some grave historical difficulties in the narrative, especially the fact that <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a>, Constantius and Eusebius were never in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at the same time. Constantius visit <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> but once, and remained there for about a month, and <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a> was then still in exile. Some, taking for granted the alleged fall of <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a>, would overcome this difficulty by stating that, at the request of <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a>, who resented the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> interfered and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> Eusebius. It is not at all certain whether Eusebius died after the return of <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a>, during his exile, or even much before that period.

<p>The feast of St. Eusebius is kept on 14 August. The church of the Equiline in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> dedicated to him, said to have been built on the site of his house, is mentioned in the acts of a council held in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under Pope Symmachus in 498 (Manai, VIII, 236-237), and was rebuilt by <a href="../cathen/15743b.htm">Pope Zacharias</a>. Formerly it had a <em>statio</em> on the Friday after the fourth <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>. It once belonged to the <a href="../cathen/16020a.htm">Celestines</a> (an order now extinct); <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> gave it to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. A good picture representing the triumph of Eusebius, by <a href="../cathen/10189a.htm">Raphael Menge</a>, 1759 is on the ceiling. San Eusebio is the title of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priest</a>. The title was transferred by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, but restored by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>.
