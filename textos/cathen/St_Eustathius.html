<h1>St. Eustathius</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, b. at Side in Pamphylia, c. 270; d. in exile at <a href="../cathen/15016c.htm">Trajanopolis in Thrace</a>, most probably in 360, according to some already in 336 or 337. He was at first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ber&aelig;a in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, whence he was transferred to Antioch c. 323. At the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> (325), he was one of the most prominent opponents of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> and from 325-330 he was engaged in an almost continuous literary <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. By his fearless denunciation of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> and his refusal to engage any <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, he incurred the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, who, headed by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea</a> and his namesake of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, held a synod at Antioch (331) at which Eustathius was accused, by suborned witnesses, of <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Sabellianism</a>, incontinency, cruelty, and other crimes. He was deposed by the synod and banished to <a href="../cathen/15016c.htm">Trajanopolis in Thrace</a> by order of the <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a>, who gave credence to the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> tales spread about Eustathius. The people of Antioch, who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> and revered their holy and learned patriarch, became indignant at the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> done to him and were ready to take up arms in his defence. But Eustathius kept them in check, exhorted them to remain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and humbly left for his place of exile, accompanied by a large body of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The adherents of Eustathius at Antioch formed a separate community by the name of Eustathians and refused to acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> set over them by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. When, after the death of Eustathius, St. Meletius became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> in 360 by the united vote of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, the Eustathians would not recognize him, even after his election was approved by the Synod of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> in 362. Their intransigent attitude gave rise to two factions among the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, the so-called <a href="../cathen/10161b.htm">Meletian Schism</a>, which lasted till the second decade of the fifth century (Cavallera, Le schisme d'Antioche, Paris, 1905).

<p>Most of the numerous dogmatic and <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> treatises of Eustathius have been lost. His principal extant work is "De Engastrimytho", in which he maintains against <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> that the apparition of Samuel (<a href="../bible/1sa028.htm">1 Samuel 28</a>) was not a reality but a mere phantasm called up in the brain of Saul by the <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witch</a> of Endor. In the same work he severely criticizes <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> for his allegorical interpretation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. A new edition of it, together with the respective <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, was made by A. Jahn in Gebhardt and Harnack's "Texte und Untersuchungen zur Gesch. der altchristl. Literatur" (Leipzig, 1886), II, fasc. iv. Cavallera recently discovered a <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christological</a> <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a>: "S. Eustathii ep. Antioch. in Lazarum, Mariam et Martham homilia christologica", which he edited together with a commentary on the literary fragments of Eustathius (Paris, 1905). Fragments of lost writings are found in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> (P.G., XVIII, 675-698), Pitra and Martin (Analecta Sacra, II, Proleg., 37-40; IV, 210-213 and 441-443). "Commentarius in Hexaemeron" (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G., XVIII, 707-794) and "Allocution ad Imp. Constantinum in Conc. Nic&aelig;no" (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G., XVIII, 673-676) are spurious. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> on 16 July, in the Greek on 21 Feb. His <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were brought to Antioch.
