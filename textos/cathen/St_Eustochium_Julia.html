<h1>St. Eustochium Julia</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">Virgin</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> c. 368; died at <a href="../cathen/02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a>, 28 September, 419 or 420. She was the third of four daughters of the Roman Senator Toxotius and his wife <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">St. Paula</a>, the former belonging to the noble Julian race, the latter tracing her ancestry through the Spipios and the Gracchi (Jerome, Ep. cxviii). After the death of her husband (c. 380) Paula and her daughter Eustochium lived in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as austere a life as the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. When <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> from Palestine in 382, they put themselves under his spiritual guidance. Hymettius, an uncle of Eustochium, and his wife Praetextata tried to persuade the youthful Eustochium to give up her austere life and enjoy the pleasures of the world, but all their attempts were futile. About the year 384 she made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of perpetual virginity, on which occasion <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> addressed to her his celebrated letter "De custodia virginitatie" (Ep. xxii in P.L., XXII, 394-425). A year later <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> returned to Palestine and soon after was followed to the Orient by Paula and Eustochium. In 386 they accompanied <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> on his journey to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, where they visited the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> of the Nitrian Desert in order to study and afterwards imitate their mode of life. In the fall of the same year they returned to Palestine and settled permanently at Bethlehem. Paula and Eustochium at once began to erect four <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and a hospice near the spot where Christ was born. While the erection of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> was in process (386-9) they lived in a small building in the neighbourhood. One of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> was occupied by <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and put under the direction of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>. The three other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were taken by Paula and Eustochium and the numerous virgins that flocked around them. The three <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunneries</a>, which were under the supervision of Paula, had only one oratory, where all the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> met several times daily for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and the chanting of psalms. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> testifies (Ep. 308) that Eustochium and Paula performed the most menial services. Much of their time they spent in the study of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> under the direction of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>.

<p>Eustochium spoke Latin and Greek with equal ease and was able to read the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> in the Hebrew text. Many of St. Jerome's Biblical commentaries owe their existence to her influence and to her he dedicated his commentaries on the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> Isaias and Ezechiel. The letters which <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> wrote for her instruction and spiritual advancement are, according to his own testimony (<a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 135</a>), very numerous. After the death of Paula in 404, Eustochium assumed the direction of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunneries</a>. Her task was a difficult one on account of the impoverished condition of the temporal affairs which was brought about by the lavish <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a> of Paula. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> was of great assistance to her by his encouragement and prudent advice. In 417 a great misfortune overtook the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at Bethlehem. A crowd of ruffians attacked and pillaged them, destroyed one of them by fire, besides killing and maltreating some of the inmates. The wicked deed was probably instigated by John, the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> against whom <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> had written some sharp polemics. Both <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> and St. Eustochium informed <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Pope Innocent I</a> by letter of the occurrence, who severely reproved the patriarch for having permitted the outrage. Eustochium died shortly after and was succeeded in the supervision of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunneries</a> by her niece, the younger Paula. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> celebrates her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> on 28 September.
