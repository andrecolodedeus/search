<h1>St. Euthymius</h1>  

<p>(Styled THE GREAT).

<p>Abbot in Palestine; b. in <a href="../cathen/10166a.htm">Melitene</a> in Lesser <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, A.D. 377; d. A.D. 473. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by Bishop Otreius of <a href="../cathen/10166a.htm">Melitene</a>, who afterwards <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> him <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and placed him in charge of all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10166a.htm">Diocese of Melitene</a>. At the age of twenty-nine he secretly set out on a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Jerusalem and remained for some time with a settlement of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> at a laura called Pharan, about six miles east of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. In 411 he withdrew, with St. Theoctistus, a fellow- <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>, into the wilderness, and lived for a while in a rough cavern on the banks of a torrent. When many disciples gathered around them they turned the cavern into a church and built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which was placed in charge of St. Theoctistus.

<p>A <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> cure which Euthymius was believed to have effected for Terebon, the son of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> chief Aspebetus, spread the fame of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> far beyond the confines of Palestine. Aspebetus was afterwards <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> over his tribe, in which capacity he attended the Council of Ephesus in 431.

<p>When the report of this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> had made the name of Euthymius famous throughout Palestine, and large crowds came to visit him in his solitude, he retreated with his disciple Domitian to the wilderness of Ruba, near the Dead Sea. Here he lived for some time on a remote mountain called Marda whence he afterwards withdrew to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Zipho (the ancient Engaddi). When large crowds followed him to this place also, he returned to the neighbourhood of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Theoctistus, where he took up his abode in a cavern. Every Sunday he came to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to take part in the Divine services. At length, because numerous disciples desired him as their spiritual guide, he founded, in 420, on the right side of the road from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, a laura similar to that of Pharan. The church connected with this laura was dedicated in 428 by Juvenal, the first <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451) condemned the <a href="../cathen/05633a.htm">errors of Eutyches</a>, it was greatly due to the authority of Euthymius that most of the Eastern <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluses</a> accepted its decrees. The empress Eudoxia was converted to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity through his efforts. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> celebrates his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> on 20 January, the day of his death.
