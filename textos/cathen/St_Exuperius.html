<h1>St. Exuperius</h1>  

<p>(Also spelled Exsuperius).

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> in the beginning of the fifth century; place and <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unascertained; died after 410. Succeeding St. Silvius as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he completed the basilica of <a href="../cathen/13486b.htm">St. Saturninus</a>, begun by his predecessor. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> praises him for his munificence to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Palestine, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and Libya, and for his charity to the people of his own diocese, who were then suffering from the depredations of the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a>, Alans, and Suevi. Of great austerity and simplicity of life, he sought not his own, but gave what he had to the poor. For their sake he even sold the altar vessels and was compelled in consequence to carry the Sacred Host in an osier basket and the Precious Blood in a vessel of glass. In esteem for his virtues and in gratitude for his gifts, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> dedicated to him his "Commentary on Zacharias . Exuperius is best known in connection with the Canon of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>. He had written to <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a> for instructions concerning the canon and several points of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>. In reply, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> him with the letter Consulenti tibi, dated February, 405, which contained a list of the canonical scriptures as we have them today, including the deuterocanonical books of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Canon, books of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Canon. The assertion of non-Catholic writers that the Canon of <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a> excluded the Apocrypha is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, if they mean to extend the term <em>Apocrypha</em> to the deuterocanonical books.

<p>The opinion of <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Exuperius was identical with the rhetor of the same name, is quite generally rejected, as the rhetor was a teacher of Hannibalianus and Dalmatius, nephews of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>, over a half a century before the period of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. From Jerome's letter to Furia of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in 394, and from the epistle of St. Paulinus to Amandus of Bordeaux, in 397, it seems probable that Exuperius was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and later at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, before he was raised to the episcopate, though it is possible that in both of these letters reference is made to a different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Just when he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is unknown. That he occupied the See of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> in February, 405, is evident from the letter of <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a> mentioned above; and from a statement of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> in a letter to Rusticus it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that he was still living in 411. It is sometimes said that <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> reproved him, in a letter to Riparius, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, for tolerating the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> Vigilantius; but as Vigilantius did not belong to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> was probably speaking of another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p>Exuperius was early <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a saint. Even in the time of <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a> he was held in equal veneration with <a href="../cathen/13486b.htm">St. Saturninus</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> occurs on 28 September. The first martyrologist to assign it to this date was <a href="../cathen/15235b.htm">Usuard</a>, who wrote towards the end of the ninth century.
