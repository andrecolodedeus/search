<h1>St. Fabiola</h1>  

<p>A Roman matron of rank, died 27 December, 399 or 400. She was one of the company of noble Roman <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who, under the influence of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, gave up all earthly pleasures and devoted themselves to the practice of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">asceticism</a> and to charitable work.

<p>At the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> stay at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (382-84), Fabiola was not one of the ascetic circle which gathered around him. It was not until a later <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> that, upon the death of her second consort, she took the decisive step of entering upon a life of <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">renunciation</a> and labour for others.

<p>Fabiola belonged to the patrician Roman <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Fabia. She had been married to a man who led so <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> a life that to live with him was impossible. She obtained a <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> from him according to <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, and, contrary to the ordinances of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, she entered upon a second union before the death of her first husband. On the day before <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, following the death of her second consort, she appeared before the gates of the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran basilica</a>, dressed in penitential garb, and did penance in public for her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, an act which made a great impression upon the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> population of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> received her formally again into full communion with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>Fabiola now renounced all that the world had to offer her, and devoted her immense <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> to the needs of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> and the sick. She erected a fine <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and waited on the inmates herself, not even shunning those afflicted with repulsive wounds and sores. Besides this she gave large sums to the churches and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and at other places in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. All her <a href="../cathen/08075a.htm">interests</a> were centered on the needs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the care of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> and suffering. In 395, she went to <a href="../cathen/02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a>, where she lived in the <a href="../cathen/07475b.htm">hospice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> directed by <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> and applied herself, under the direction of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, with the greatest <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> to the study and <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptures</a>, and to ascetic exercises.

<p>An incursion of the Huns into the eastern provinces of the empire, and the quarrel which broke out between <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> and Bishop John of Jerusalem respecting the teachings of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, made residence in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> unpleasant for her, and she returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. She remained, however, in correspondence with <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, who at her request wrote a treatise on the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and the priestly dress. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Fabiola united with the former senator <a href="../cathen/11436a.htm">Pammachius</a> in carrying out a great charitable undertaking; together they erected at Porto a large <a href="../cathen/07475b.htm">hospice</a> for <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> coming to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Fabiola also continued her usual personal labours in aid of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> and sick until her death. Her funeral was a wonderful manifestation of the gratitude and veneration with which she was regarded by the Roman populace. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> wrote a eulogistic memoir of Fabiola in a letter to her relative Oceanus.
