<h1>St. Felicitas</h1>  

<p>MARTYR.

<p>The earliest list of the Roman feasts of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, known as the "Depositio Martyrum" and <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the time of <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Pope Liberius</a>, i.e. about the middle of the fourth century (Ruinart, Acta sincera, <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, p. 631), mentions seven <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> whose feast was kept on 10 July. Their remains had been deposited in four different <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>, viz. in three cemeteries on the Via Salaria and in one on the Via Appia. Two of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, Felix and Philip, reposed in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of Priscilla; Martial, Vitalis and Alexander, in the <em>Coemeterium Jordanorum</em>; Silanus (or Silvanus) in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of Maximus, and <a href="../cathen/08295a.htm">Januarius</a> in that of Pr&aelig;textatus. To the name of Silanus is added the statement that his body was <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">stolen</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatians</a> (<em>hunc Silanum martyrem Novatiani furati sunt</em>). In the Acts of these <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, that certainly existed in the sixth century, since <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> refers to them in his "Homili&aelig; super Evangelia" (Lib. I, hom. iii, in P.L., LXXVI, 1087), it is stated that all seven were sons of Felicitas, a noble Roman lady. According to these Acts Felicitas and her seven sons were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> because of their <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>, at the instigation of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, during the reign of <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Emperor Antoninus</a>. Before the prefect Publius they adhered firmly to their religion, and were delivered over to four judges, who condemned them to various modes of death. The division of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> among four judges corresponds to the four places of their burial. St. Felicitas herself was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of Maximus on the Via Salaria, beside Silanus.

<p>These Acts were regarded as genuine by Ruinart (op. cit., 72-74), and even distinguished modern arch&aelig;ologists have considered them, though not in their present form corresponding entirely to the original, yet in substance based on genuine contemporary records. Recent investigations of F&uuml;hrer, however (see below), have shown this opinion to be hardly tenable. The earliest recension of these Acts, edited by Ruinart, does not antedate the sixth century, and appears to be based not on a Roman, but on a Greek original. Moreover, apart from the present form of the Acts, various details have been called in question. Thus, if Felicitas were really the mother of the seven <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> on 10 July, it is strange that her name does not appear in the well-known fourth-century Roman calendar. Her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is first mentioned in the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum", but on a different day (23 Nov.). It is, however, historically certain that she, as well as the seven <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> called her sons in the Acts suffered for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>. From a very early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> celebrated in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> on 23 November, for on that day <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> delivered a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> in the basilica that rose above her <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. Her body then rested in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of Maximus; in that cemetery on the Via Salaria all Roman itineraries, or guides to the burial-places of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, locate her burial-place, specifying that her <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> was in a church above this <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> (<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, Roma sotterranea, I, 176-77), and that the body of her son Silanus was also there. The <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> where Felicitas was laid to rest was later enlarged into a subterranean <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and was rediscovered in 1885. A seventh-century fresco is yet visible on the rear wall of this <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, representing in a group Felicitas and her seven sons, and overhead the figure of Christ bestowing upon them the eternal crown.

<p>Certain historical references to St. Felicitas and her sons antedate the aforesaid Acts, e.g. a fifth-century sermon of St. Peter Chrysologus (Sermo cxxxiv, in P.L., LII, 565) and a metrical epitaph either written by Pope Damasus (d. 384) or composed shortly after his time and suggested by his poem in praise of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>: <blockquote> Discite quid meriti pr&aelig;stet pro rege feriri; <br>Femina non timuit gladium, cum natis obivit, <br>Confessa Christum meruit per s&aelig;cula nomen. </blockquote>

<p>[Learn how meritorious it is to die for the King (Christ). This <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> feared not the sword, but perished with her sons. She confessed Christ and merited an eternal renown.--Ihm, Damasi Epigrammata (Leipzig, 1895), p. 45.] We possess, therefore, confirmation for an ancient Roman tradition, independent of the Acts, to the effect that the Felicitas who reposed in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of Maximus, and whose feast the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> commemorated 23 Nov., suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> with her sons; it does not record, however, any details concerning these sons. It may be recalled that the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Silanus, one of the seven <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> (10 July), adjoined that of St. Felicitas and was likewise <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a>; it is quite possible, therefore, that tradition soon identified the sons of St. Felicitas with the seven <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and that this formed the basis for the extant Acts. The <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Januarius in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of Pr&aelig;textatus belongs to the end of the second century, to which period, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> must belong, probably under <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a>. If St. Felicitas did not suffer <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> on the same occasion we have no means of determining the time of her death. In an ancient Roman edifice near the ruins of the Baths of Titus there stood in early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a> a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Felicitas. A faded <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> in this <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> represents her with her sons just as in the above-mentioned fresco in her <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a>. Her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated 23 Nov.
