<h1>St. Felix of Cantalice</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friar</a>, b. at Cantalice, on the north-western border of the Abruzzi; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 18 May, 1587. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated among the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and in certain <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> on 18 May. He is usually represented in art as holding in his arms the Infant <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, because of a vision he once had, when the Blessed Virgin appeared to him and placed the Divine Child in his arms.

<p>His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were peasant folk, and very early he was set to tend sheep. When nine years of age he was hired out to a farmer at Cotta Ducale with whom he remained for over twenty years, first as a shepherd-boy and afterwards as a farm labourer. But from his earliest years Felix evinced signs of great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, spending all his leisure time in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, either in the harsh or in some solitary place. A friend of his having read to him the lives of the Fathers of the Desert, Felix conceived a great desire for the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">eremitical</a> life, but at the same time feared to live otherwise than under the obedience of a superior. After seeking light in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, he determined to ask admittance amongst the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>. At first the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> hesitated to accept him, but he eventually received the habit, in 1543, at Anticoli in the Roman Province. It was not without the severest <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> that he persevered and made his profession. These <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> were so severe as injure his bodily health. In 1547 he was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and appointed questor for the community. Here he remained for the rest of his life, and in fulfilling his lowly office became a veritable apostle of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>The influence which he speedily gained with the Roman people is an evidence of the inherent power of personal <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> over the consciences of men. He had no learning he could not even read; yet learned <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> came to consult him upon the.science of the spiritual life and the Scriptures. Whenever he appeared in the streets of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> vicious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> grew abased and withdrew from his sight. Sometimes Felix would stop them and earnestly exhort them to live a better life; especially did he endeavour to restrain young men. But judges and dignitaries also at times incurred his rebuke, he was no respecter of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> when it was a matter of preventing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. On one occasion, during a Carnival, he and <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a> organized a procession with their crucifix; then came the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>; last came Felix leading Fra Lupo, a well-known <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> preacher, by a rope round his neck, to represent <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> led to judgment by his executioners. Arrived in the middle of the revels, the procession halted and Fra Lupo preached to the people. The Carnival, with its open vice, was broken up for that year.

<p>But Felix's special apostolate was amongst the children of the city, with whom his childlike simplicity made him a special favourite. His method with these was to gather them together in bands and, forming circle, set them to sing canticles of his own composing, by which he taught them the beauty of a good life and the ugliness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. These canticles became popular and frequently, when on his rounds in quest of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, Felix would be invited into the houses of his benefactors and asked to sing. He would seize the opportunity to bring home some spiritual <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in extemporized verse. During the famine of 1580 the directors of the city's charities asked his superiors to place Felix at their disposal to collect <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> for the starving, and he was untiring in his quest.

<p><a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a> had a deep affection for the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a>, whom he once proclaimed the greatest saint then living in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. When <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> sought St. Philip's aid in drawing up the constitutions of his Oblates, St. Philip took him to St. Felix as the most competent adviser in such matters. But through all, Felix kept his wonderful <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and simplicity. He was accustomed to style himself "Ass of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>". Acclaimed a Saint by the people of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, immediately after his death, he was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> in 1625, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Clement XI in 1712. His body rests under an altar dedicated to him in the church of the Immaculate Conception to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.
