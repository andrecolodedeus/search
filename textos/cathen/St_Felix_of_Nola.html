<h1>St. Felix of Nola</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/11089b.htm">Nola</a>, near <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and lived in the third century. After his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> death he distributed almost all his goods amongst the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by Maximum <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11089b.htm">Nola</a>. In the year 250, when the <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> broke out, Maximus was forced to flee. The <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a> seized on Felix and he was cruelly scourged, loaded with chains, and cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. One night an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> appeared to him and bade him go to help Maximus. His chains fell off, the doors opened, and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was enabled to bring relief to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who was then speechless from cold and hunger. On the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a> making a second attempt to secure Felix, his escape was <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> effected by a spider weaving her web over the opening of a hole into which he had just crept. Thus deceived, they sought their prey elsewhere. The <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> ceased the following year, and Felix, who had lain hidden in a dry well for six months, returned to his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. On the death of Maximus he was earnestly desired as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but he persuaded the people to choose another, his senior in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. The remnant of his estate having been confiscated in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, he refused to take it back, and for his subsistence rented three acres of land, which he tilled with his own hands. Whatever remained over he gave to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and if he had two coats at any time he invariably gave them the better. He lived to a ripe old age and died 14 January (on which day he is commemorated), but the year of his death is uncertain. Five churches were built in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, outside <a href="../cathen/11089b.htm">Nola</a>, where his remains are kept, but some <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are also at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>. <a href="../cathen/11585a.htm">St. Paulinus</a>, who acted as <a href="../cathen/12284b.htm">porter</a> to one of these churches, testifies to numerous <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> made in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Felix. The poems and letters of Paulinus on Felix are the source from which <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a>, <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Marcellus have drawn their biographies (see <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">PAULINUS OF NOLA</a>). There is another Felix of Nola, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> under a Prefect Martianus. He is considered by some to be the same as the above.
