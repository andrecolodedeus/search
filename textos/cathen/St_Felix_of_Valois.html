<h1>St. Felix of Valois</h1>  

<p>Born in 1127; d. at Cerfroi, 4 November, 1212. He is commemorated 20 November. He was surnamed Valois because, according to some, he was a member of the royal branch of Valois in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, according to others, because he was a native of the province of Valois. At an early age he renounced his possessions and retired to a dense forest in the Diocese of Meaux, where he gave himself to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and contemplation. He was joined in his retreat by St. John of Matha, who proposed to him the project of founding an order for the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of captives. After fervent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, Felix in company with John set out for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and arrived there in the beginning of the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>. They had letters of recommendation from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> received them with the utmost kindness and lodged them in his palace. The project of founding the order was considered in several <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">solemn conclaves</a> of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> after fervent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> decided that these holy men were inspired by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and raised up for the good of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He solemnly confirmed their order, which he named the Order of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> for the Redemption of Captives. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> commissioned the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Victor to draw up for the institute a rule, which was confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, 17 December, 1198. Felix returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to establish the order. He was received with great enthusiasm, and <a href="../cathen/12001a.htm">King Philip Augustus</a> authorized the institute <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and fostered it by signal benefactions. Margaret of <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a> granted the order twenty acres of the wood where Felix had built his first hermitage, and on almost the same spot he erected the famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Cerfroi, the mother-house of the institute. Within forty years the order possessed six hundred <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in almost every part of the world. St. Felix and St. John of Matha were forced to part, the latter went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to found a house of the order, the church of which, Santa Maria in Navicella, still stands on the Caeclian Hill. St. Felix remained in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to look after the interests of the congregation. He founded a house in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> attached to the church of St. Maturinus, which afterwards became famous under Robert Guguin, master general of the order. Though the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> is no longer extant, it is the constant tradition of his institute that he was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> in 1262. Du Plessis tells us that his feast was kept in the Diocese of Meaux in 1215. In 1666 <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> declared him a saint because of immemorial cult. His feast was transferred to 20 November by <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> in 1679.
