<h1>St. Ferdinand III</h1>  

<p>King of <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a> and Castile, member of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis, born in 1198 near Salamanca; died at <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, 30 May, 1252. He was the son of Alfonso IX, King of <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>, and of Berengeria, the daughter of Alfonso III, King of Castile, and sister of Blanche, the mother of St. Louis IX.

<p>In 1217 Ferdinand became King of Castile, which crown his mother renounced in his favour, and in 1230 he succeeded to the crown of <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>, though not without civil strife, since many were opposed to the union of the two kingdoms. He took as his counsellors the wisest men in the State, saw to the strict administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and took the greatest care not to overburden his subjects with taxation, fearing, as he said, the curse of one poor <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> more than a whole army of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. Following his mother's advice, Ferdinand, in 1219, married Beatrice, the daughter of Philip of Swabia, King of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, one of the most virtuous princesses of her time. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> blessed this union with seven children: six princes and one princess. The highest aims of Ferdinand's life were the propagation of the Faith and the liberation of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> yoke. Hence his continual <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. He took from them vast territories, <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a> and Alicante alone remaining in their power at the time of his death. In the most important towns he founded <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, reestablished <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship everywhere, built churches, founded <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and endowed <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. The greatest joys of his life were the conquests of <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a> (1236) and Seville (1248). He turned the great mosques of these places into <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>, dedicating them to the Blessed Virgin. He watched over the conduct of his soldiers, confiding more in their virtue than in their valour, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> strictly himself, wore a rough hairshirt, and often spent his nights in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, especially before battles. Amid the tumult of the camp he lived like a religious in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. The glory of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of his people were the two guiding motives of his life. He founded the <a href="../cathen/13392a.htm">University of Salamanca</a>, the Athens of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Ferdinand was buried in the great <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Seville before the image of the Blessed Virgin, clothed, at his own request, in the habit of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis. His body, it is said, remains incorrupt. Many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> took place at his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a> <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> him in 1671. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept by the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a> on the 30th of May.
