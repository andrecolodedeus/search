<h1>St. Fiacc</h1>  

<p>(Lived about 415-520.) A poet, chief <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Leinster, and founder of two churches. His father, MacDara, was prince of the Hy-Bairrche in the country around Carlow. His mother was sister of Dubhtach, the chief bard and brehon of Erin, the first of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick's</a> converts at Tara, and the apostle's lifelong friend. Fiacc was a pupil to his uncle in the bardic profession and soon embraced the Faith. Subsequently, when <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick</a> came to Leinster, he sojourned at Dubhtach's house in Hy-Kinsellagh and selected Fiacc, on Dubhtach's recommendation, to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for the converts of Leinster. Fiacc was then a widower; his wife had recently died, leaving him one son named Fiacre. <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick</a> gave him an alphabet written with his own hand, and Fiacc acquired with marvellous rapidity the learning <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the episcopal order. <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him, and in after time appointed him chief <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the province. Fiacc founded the church of Domnach-Fiech, east of the Barrow. Dr. Healy identifies its site at Kylebeg. To this church <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick</a> presented <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">sacred vestments</a>, a bell, the Pauline Epistles and <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">pastoral staff</a>. After many years of austere life in this place, Fiacc was led by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> command to remove to the west of the Barrow, for there "he would find the place of his <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>". The legends state that he was directed to build his oratory where he should meet a hind, his refectory where he should find a boar. He consulted <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick</a>, the latter fixed the site of his new church at Sletty--"the highland"--a mile and a half northwest of Carlow. Here while built a large <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, which he ruled as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> while at the same time he governed the surrounding country as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. His annual <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> retreat to the cave of Drum-Coblai and the rigours of his <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> fast, on five barley loaves mixed with ashes, are mentioned in his life by Jocelyn of Furness. He suffered for many years from a painful disease and <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick</a>, commiserating his infirmity, sent him a chariot and a pair of horses to help him in the visitation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He lived to a very old age; sixty of his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> disciples were gathered to their rest before him. His festival ha been always observed on the 12th of October. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in his own church at Sletty, his son Fiacre, whom <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick</a> had <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, occupying the same grave. They are mentioned in several <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">calendars</a> as jointly revered in certain churches.

<p>St. Fiacc is the reputed author of the metrical life of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, a document of undoubted antiquity and of prime importance as the earliest biography of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> that has come down to us. A <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> on St. Brigid, "Audite virginis laudes", has been sometimes attributed to him, but on insufficient grounds.
