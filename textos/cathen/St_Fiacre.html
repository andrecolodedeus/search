<h1>St. Fiacre</h1>  

<p>Abbot, born in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> about the end of the sixth century; died 18 August, 670. Having been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he retired to a hermitage on the banks of the Nore of which the townland Kilfiachra, or Kilfera, County Kilkenny, still preserves the memory. Disciples flocked to him, but, desirous of greater solitude, he left his native land and arrived, in 628, at Meaux, where St. Faro then held episcopal sway. He was generously received by Faro, whose kindly feelings were engaged to the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> for <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> which he and his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> house had received from the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> missionary Columbanus. Faro granted him out of his own patrimony a site at Brogillum (Breuil) surrounded by forests. Here Fiacre built an oratory in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> Mary, a hospice in which he received strangers, and a cell in which he himself lived apart. He lived a life of great <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, fast, vigil, and the manual labour of the garden. Disciples gathered around him and soon formed a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. There is a legend that St. Faro allowed him as much land as he might surround in one day with a furrow; that Fiacre turned up the earth with the point of his <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>, and that an officious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> hastened to tell Faro that he was being beguiled; that <a href="../cathen/05789a.htm">Faro</a> coming to the wood recognized that the wonderworker was a man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and sought his blessing, and that Fiacre henceforth excluded <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, on pain of severe bodily infirmity, from the precincts of his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. In reality, the exclusion of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> was a common rugin the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> foundations. His fame for <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> was widespread. He cured all manner of diseases by laying on his hands; blindness, polypus, fevers are mentioned, and especially a tumour or fistula since called "le fic de S. Fiacre".

<p>His remains were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the church at Breuil, where his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> was soon attested by the numerous cures wrought at his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. Many churches and <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> have been dedicated to him throughout <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. His shrine at Breuil is still a resort for <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> with bodily ailments. In 1234 his remains were placed in a shrine by Pierre, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Meaux, his arm being encased in a separate <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a>. In 1479 the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of Sts. Fiacre and Kilian were placed in a silver shrine, which was removed in 1568 to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> at Meaux for safety from the destructive fanaticism of the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>. In 1617 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Meaux gave part of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> body to the Grand Duke of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, and in 1637 the shrine was again opened and part of the vertebrae given to <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Cardinal Richelieu</a>. A mystery play of the fifteenth century celebrates St. Fiacre's life and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. St. John of Matha, Louis XIII, and Anne of Austria were among his most famous clients. He is the patron of gardeners. The French cab derives its name from him. The H&ocirc;tel de St-Fiacre, in the Rue St-Martin, Paris, in the middle of the seventeenth century first let these coaches on hire. The sign of the inn was an image of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, and the coaches in time came to be called by his name. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on the 30th of August.
