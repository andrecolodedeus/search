<h1>St. Flavian</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantinople, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; d. at <a href="../cathen/07604a.htm">Hyp&aelig;pa</a> in Lydia, August, 449. Nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of him before his elevation to the episcopate save that he was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> and <em>skeuophylax</em> or <a href="../cathen/13322a.htm">sacristan</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople, and noted for the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of his life. His succession to <a href="../cathen/12449b.htm">St. Proclus</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was in opposition to the wishes of the eunuch Chrysaphius minister of <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a>, who sought to bring him into imperial disfavour. He persuaded the emperor to require of the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> certain <em><a href="../cathen/05603b.htm">eulogiae</a></em> on the occasion of his appointment, but scornfully rejected the proffered blessed bread on the plea that the emperor desired gifts of gold. Flavian's intrepid refusal, on the ground of the impropriety of thus disposing of church the treasures, aroused considerable enmity against him. Pulcheria, the emperor's sister, being Flavian's staunch advocate Chrysaphius secured the support of the Empress Eudocia. Although their first efforts to involve St. Flavian in disgrace miscarried, an opportunity soon presented itself. At a council of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> convened at Constantinople by Flavian, 8 Nov., 448, to settle a dispute which had arisen among his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrite</a> <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a>, who was a relation of Chrysaphius was accused of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> by <a href="../cathen/05622a.htm">Eusebius of Dorylaeum</a>. (For the proceedings of the council see <a href="../cathen/05622a.htm">EUSEBIUS OF DORYLAEUM</a>; <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">EUTYCHES</a>.) Flavian exercised clemency and urged moderation, but in the end the refusal of <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a> to make an <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> declaration on the two natures of Christ forced Flavian to pronounce the sentence of degradation and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. He forwarded a full report of the council to <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Pope Leo I</a>, who in turn gave his approval to Flavian's decision (21 May, 449) and the following month (13 June) sent him his famous "Dogmatic Letter". <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches'</a> complaint that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> had been violated in the council and that the Acts had been tampered with resulted in an imperial order for the revision of Acts, executed (8 and 27 April, 449). No materior could be established, and Flavian was justified.

<p>The long-standing rivalry between Alexandria and Constantinoble now became a strong factor in the dissensions. It had been none the less keen since the See of Constantinoble had been officially declared next in dignity to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscurus</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, was quite ready to join forces with <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a> against Flavian. Even before the revision of the Acts of Flavian's council, Chrysaphius had persuaded the emperor of the necessity for an oecumenical council to adjust matters, and the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> went forth that one should convene at Ephesus under the presidency of <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscurus</a>, who also controlled the attendance of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Flavian and six <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had assisted at the previous synod were allowed no voice, being, as it were, on trial. (For a full account of the proceedings see <a href="../cathen/05495a.htm">ROBBER COUNCIL OF EPHESUS</a>). <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a> was absolved of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and despite the protest of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> Hilary (later <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>), who by his <em>Contradicitur</em> annulled the decisions of the council, Flavian was condemned and deposed. In the violent scenes which ensued he was so ill-used that three days later he died in his place of exile. Anatolius, a partisan of <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscurus</a>, was appointed to succeed him.

<p>St. Flavian was repeatedly vindicated by Pope Leo, whose epistle of commendation failed to reach him before his death. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> also wrote in his favour to Theodosius, Pulcheria, and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Constantinople, besides convening a council at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, wherein he designated the Council of <em>Ephesus Ephecinum non judicium sed latrocinium</em>. At the council of Chalcedon (451) the Acts of the Robber Council were annulled and Flavian eulogized as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> for the Faith. Pope Hilary had Flavian's death represented pictorially in a Roman church erected by him. On Pulcheria's accession to power, after the death of Theodosius, she brought the remains of her friend to Constantinople where they were received in triumph and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> with those of his predecessors in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. In the Greek <a href="../cathen/10191b.htm">Menology</a> and the Roman Martyrology his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is entered 18 February, the anniversary of the translation of his body. <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">Relics</a> of St. Flavian are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>.

<p>St. Flavian's appeal to Pope Leo against the Robber Council has been published by Amelli in his work "S. Leone Magno e l'Oriente" (Monte Cassino, 1890), also by Lacey (Cambridge, 1903). Two other (Greek and Latin) letters to Leo are preserved in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L. (LIV, 723-32, 743-51), and one to <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a> also in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G. (LXV, 889-92).
