<h1>St. Foillan</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/08116a.htm">Irish</a> FAELAN, FAOLAN, FOELAN, FOALAN.)

<p>Represented in iconography with a crown at his feet to show that he despised the honours of the world. He was born in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> early in the seventh century and was the brother of Saints Ultan and Fursey, the latter a famous missionary who preached the Faith to the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, the Anglo-saxons, and the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>. Foillan, probably in company with Ultan, went with his brother Fursey when the latter, fleeing from his country then devastated by foreign invaders, retired to a lonely islands. Fursey soon went among the Anglo Saxons and built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Burgh Castle (Cnoberesburg) in Suffolk, between 634 and 650.

<p>Seized again with the desire for solitude, Fursey left the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the care of Foillan, who remained at the head of the community, and had the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of once more seeing his brother Fursey, who, having since gone to the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, came to visit him about 650. Soon a disastrous <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> broke out between Penda, the Mercian chief, and Ana, King of the Eastern Anglo-Saxons. Ana having been put to flight, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Cnoberesburg fell into the hand of the enemies. It was pillaged, and its superior, Foillan, barely escaped death. He hastened to ransom the captive <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, recovered the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, put the holy books and objects of veneration on board ship, and departed for the country of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, where his brother Fursey was buried. He and his companions were well received at P&eacute;ronne by Erconwald, Mayor of the Palace. But soon, for some unknown reason, Foillan and his companions left P&eacute;ronne and went to Nivelles, a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> founded by <a href="../cathen/08201c.htm">St. Ita</a> and St. Gertrude, wife and daughter of Duke Pepin I.

<p>Foillan, like so many other <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irishmen</a> who went to the Continent in the seventh century, was invested with episcopal dignity, having doubtless been a monastic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at Cnoberesburg. He was therefore of great assistance in the organization of worship, and the holy books and <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> which he brought were great; treasures for <a href="../cathen/08201c.htm">St. Ita</a> and St. Gertrude. As the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Nivelles was under <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> discipline, the companions of Foillan were well received and lived side by side with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, occupying themselves with the details of worship under the general direction of the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>. Through the liberality of Ita, Foillan was enabled to build a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Fosses, not far from Nivelles, in the province of <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a>. After the death of Ita in 652, Foillan came one day to Nivelles and sang Mass, on the eve of the feast of St-Quentin. The <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> being finished, he resumed his journey, doubtless undertaken in the interests of his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. In the forest of Senege the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> and his companions fell into a trap set by bandits who inhabited that solitude. They were slain, stripped, and their bodies concealed. But they were recovered by St. Gertrude, and when she had taken some <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> his body was borne to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Fosses, where it was buried about 655.

<p>Foillan was one of the numerous <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> travellers who in the course of the seventh century evangelized <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, bringing thither the liturgy and <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a>, founding prosperous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and sharing considerably in the propagation of the Faith in these countries. Owing to the friendship which united him with Erconwald, Mayor of the Palace, and with the members of Pepin's family, Foillan played a preponderant part in <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>, as shown by his share in the direction of Nivelles and by the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Fosses. It is not surprising, therefore, that he should be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> and <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> both at Nivelles and Fosses and to find at Le Roeulx (Belgium) a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> bearing his name. As late as the twelfth century the veneration in which he was held inspired Philippe Le Harvengt, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Bonne-Esp&eacute;rance, to compose a lengthy biography of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. He is the patron of Fosses, near Charieroi. In the <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Diocese of Namur</a> his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 31 October, in the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> and Tournai on 5 November.
