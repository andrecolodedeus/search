<h1>St. Francis Caracciolo</h1>  

<p>Co-founder with John Augustine Adorno of the Conregation of the Minor <a href="../cathen/04051d.htm">Clerks Regular</a>; b. in Villa Santa Maria in the Abrusso (<a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>), 13 October, 1563; d. at Agnone, 4 June, 1608. He belonged to the Pisquizio branch of the Caracciolo and received in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the name of Ascanio. From his infancy he was remarkable for his gentleness and uprightness. Having been cured of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> at the age of twenty-two he vowed himself to an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life, and distributing his goods to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, went to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> in 1585 to study <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. In 1587 he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and joined the confraternity of the <em>Bianchi della Giustizia</em> (The white robes of Justice), whose object was to assist condemned criminals to die holy deaths. A letter frorn Giovanni Agostino Adorno to another Ascanio Caracciolo, begging him to take part in founding a new religious institute, having been delivered by mistake to our saint, he saw in this circumstance an confidence of the Divine Will towards him (1588). He assisted in drawing up rules for the new congregation, which was approved by <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>, 1 July, 1588, and confirmed by <a href="../cathen/07004a.htm">Gregory XIV</a>, 18 February 1591, and by <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, 1 June, 1592.

<p>The congregation is both contemplative and active, and to the three usual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> a fourth is added, namely, that its members must not aspire to <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignities</a> outside the order nor seek them within it. Adoration of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is kept up by rotation, and <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> is continually practised. The motto of the order "Ad majorem Dei Resurgentis gloriam" was chosen from the fact that Francis and Adorno made their profession at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> on <a href="../cathen/09400a.htm">Low Sunday</a>, 9 April, 1589. In spite of his refusal he was chosen general, 9 March, 1593, in the first house of the congregation in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, called St. Mary Major's or Pietrasanta, given to them by <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>. He made three journeys into <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> to establish foundations under the protection of Philip II and Philip III. He opened the house of the Holy Ghost at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> on 20 January, 1599, that of Our Lady of the Annunciation at Valladolid on 9 September, 1601, and that of St. Joseph at <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">Alcal&aacute;</a> sometime in 1601, for teaching <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he obtained possession of St. Leonard's church, which he afterwards exchanged for that of St. Agnes in the Piazza Navona (18 September, 1598), and later he secured for the institute the church of San Lorenso in Lucina (11 June, 1606) which was made over to him by a bull of Pope Paul X, and which was, however, annulled by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Susceptum" of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pope Pius X</a> (9 November, 1906).

<p>St. Francis Caracciolo was the author of a valuable work, "Le sette stazioni sopra la Passione di N.S. Ges&ugrave; Christo", which was printed in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1710. He <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> the poor. Like <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, a relative on his mother's side, his purity was <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a>. <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Pope Paul V</a> desired to confer an important <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> on him, but he steadfastly refused it. His frequent motto was "Zelus domus tuae comedit me". Invited by the <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a> at Agnone in the Abruzzo to convert their house into a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for his congregation, he fell ill during the negotiations and died there on the vigil of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Pope Clement XIV</a> on 4 June, 1769, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pope Pius VII</a> on 24 May, 1807. In 1838 he was chosen as patron of the city of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, where his body lies. At first he was buried in St. Mary Major's, but his remains were afterwards translated to the church of Monteverginella, which was given in exchange to the Minor <a href="../cathen/04051d.htm">Clerks Regular</a> (1823) after their suppression at the time of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. St. Francis is no longer <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> there with old fervour and devotion.
