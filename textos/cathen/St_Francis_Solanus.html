<h1>St. Francis Solanus</h1>  

<p>South American missionary of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Order of Friars Minor</a>; b. at Montilla, in the Diocese of Cordova, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 10 March, 1549; d. at <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a>, <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, 14 July, 1610. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, Matthew Sanchez Solanus and Anna Ximenes, were distinguished no less for their noble birth than for their virtue and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. When Francis was twenty years old, he was received into the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> at Montilla, and after his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, several years later, he was sent by his superiors to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Arifazza as master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>. In 1589 he sailed from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>, and having landed at <a href="../cathen/11438a.htm">Panama</a>, crossed the isthmus and embarked on a vessel that was to convey him to <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>. His missionary labours in South America extended over a period of twenty years, during which time he spared no fatigue, shrank from no sacrifice however great, and feared no danger that stood in the way of evangelizing the vast and savage regions of Tucuman and Paraguay. So successful, indeed, was his apostolate that he has been aptly styled the Thaumaturgus of the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>. Notwithstanding the number and difficulty of the dialects spoken by the Indians, he learned them all in a very short time, and it is said that he often addressed tribes of different tongues in one language and was understood by them all. Besides being engaged in active missionary work, he filled the office of <a href="../cathen/04577a.htm">custos</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of his order in Tucuman and Paraguay, and later was elected guardian of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a>, <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>. In 1610, while preaching at Truxillo he foretold the calamities that were to befall that city, which was destroyed by an earthquake eight years later, most of the inhabitants perishing in the ruins. The death of St. Francis, which he himself had foretold, was the cause of general grief throughout <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>. In his funeral sermon at the burial of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, Father Sebastiani, S.J., said that "Divine Providence had chosen Father Francis Solanus to be the hope and edification of all <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, the example and glory of <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a> and the splendour of the Seraphic Order". St. Francis was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a>, in 1675, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, in 1726. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept throughout the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> on the twenty-fourth of July.
