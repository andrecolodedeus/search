<h1>St. Francis Xavier</h1>  

<p>Born in the Castle of Xavier near Sanguesa, in <a href="../cathen/10721a.htm">Navarre</a>, 7 April, 1506; died on the Island of Sancian near the coast of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, 2 December, 1552. In 1525, having completed a preliminary course of studies in his own country, Francis Xavier went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he entered the coll&egrave;ge de Sainte-Barbe. Here he met the <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoyard</a>, Pierre Favre, and a warm personal friendship sprang up between them. It was at this same college that <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius Loyola</a>, who was already planning the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, resided for a time as a guest in 1529. He soon won the confidence of the two young men; first Favre and later Xavier offered themselves with him in the formation of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. Four others, <a href="../cathen/08747a.htm">Lainez</a>, <a href="../cathen/13402b.htm">Salmer&oacute;n</a>, Rodr&iacute;guez, and <a href="../cathen/02605a.htm">Bobadilla</a>, having joined them, the seven made the famous <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of Montmartre, 15 Aug., 1534.

<p>After completing his studies in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and filling the post of teacher there for some time, Xavier left the city with his companions 15 November, 1536, and turned his steps to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, where he displayed <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and charity in attending the sick in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. On 24 June, 1537, he received <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> with <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius</a>. The following year he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and after doing apostolic work there for some months, during the spring of 1539 he took part in the conferences which <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius</a> held with his companions to prepare for the definitive foundation of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. The order was approved verbally 3 September, and before the written <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> was secured, which was not until a year later, Xavier was appointed, at the earnest solicitation of the John III, King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, to evangelize the people of the East Indies. He left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> 16 March, 1540, and reached <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> about June. Here he remained nine months, giving many admirable examples of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a>.

<p>On 7 April, 1541, he embarked in a sailing vessel for <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and after a tedious and dangerous voyage landed at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, 6 May, 1542. The first five months he spent in preaching and ministering to the sick in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. He would go through the streets ringing a little bell and inviting the children to hear the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. When he had gathered a number, he would take them to a certain church and would there explain the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> to them. About October, 1542, he started for the pearl fisheries of the extreme southern coast of the peninsula, desirous of restoring Christanity which, although introduced years before, had almost disappeared on account of the lack of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. He devoted almost three years to the work of preaching to the people of Western <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, converting many, and reaching in his journeys even the Island of Ceylon. Many were the difficulties and hardships which Xavier had to encounter at this time, sometimes on account of the cruel persecutions which some of the petty kings of the country carried on against the <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a>, and again because the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> soldiers, far from seconding the work of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, retarded it by their bad example and vicious habits.

<p>In the spring of 1545 Xavier started for Malacca. He laboured there for the last months of that year, and although he reaped an abundant spiritual harvest, he was not able to root out certain abuses, and was conscious that many sinners had resisted his efforts to bring them back to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. About January, 1546, Xavier left Malacca and went to Molucca Islands, where the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> had some settlements, and for a year and a half he preached the Gospel to the inhabitants of Amboyna, Ternate, Baranura, and other lesser islands which it has been difficult to identify. It is claimed by some that during this expedition he landed on the island of Mindanao, and for this reason St. Francis Xavier has been called the first Apostle of the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>. But although this statement is made by some writers of the seventeenth century, and in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> issued in 1623, it is said that he preached the Gospel in Mindanao, up to the present time it has not been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> absolutely that St. Francis Xavier ever landed in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>.

<p>By July, 1547, he was again in <a href="../cathen/09562a.htm">Malacca</a>. Here he met a <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> called Anger (Han-Sir), from whom he obtained much information about <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> was at once aroused by the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of introducing Christanity into <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, but for the time being the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> demanded his presence at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, whither he went, taking Anger with him. During the six years that Xavier had been working among the infidels, other <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries had arrived at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, sent from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> by <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius</a>; moreover some who had been born in the country had been received into the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. In 1548 Xavier sent these missionaries to the principal centres of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, where he had established missions, so that the work might be preserved and continued. He also established a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and house of studies, and having received into the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> Father Cosme de Torres, a spanish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> whom he had met in the Maluccas, he started with him and Brother Juan Fern&aacute;ndez for <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> towards the end of June, 1549. The <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> Anger, who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> and given the name of Pablo de Santa Fe, accompanied them.

<p>They landed at the city of Kagoshima in <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, 15 Aug., 1549. The entire first year was devoted to learning the <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> language and translating into <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a>, with the help of Pablo de Santa Fe, the principal <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> and short treatises which were to be employed in preaching and catechizing. When he was able to express himself, Xavier began preaching and made some converts, but these aroused the ill will of the bonzes, who had him banished from the city. Leaving Kagoshima about August, 1550, he penetrated to the centre of <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, and preached the Gospel in some of the cities of southern <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. Towards the end of that year he reached Meaco, then the principal city of <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, but he was unable to make any headway here because of the dissensions the rending the country. He retraced his steps to the centre of <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, and during 1551 preached in some important cities, forming the nucleus of several <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities, which in time increased with extraordinary rapidity.

<p>After working about two years and a half in <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> he left this mission in charge of Father Cosme de Torres and Brother Juan Fern&aacute;ndez, and returned to <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, arriving there at the beginning of 1552. Here domestic troubles awaited him. Certain disagreements between the superior who had been left in charge of the missions, and the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the college, had to be adjusted. This, however, being arranged, Xavier turned his thoughts to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, and began to plan an expedition there. During his stay in <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> he had heard much of the <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Celestial Empire</a>, and though he probably had not formed a proper estimate of his extent and greatness, he nevertheless understood how wide a field it afforded for the spread of the light of the Gospel. With the help of friends he arranged a commission or embassy the Sovereign of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, obtained from the Viceroy of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> the appointment of ambassador, and in April, 1552, he left <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>. At Malacca the party encountered difficulties because the influential Portuguese disapproved of the expedition, but Xavier <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to overcome this opposition, and in the autumn he arrived in a Portuguese vessel at the small island of Sancian near the coast of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. While planning the best means for reaching the mainland, he was taken ill, and as the movement of the vessel seemed to aggravate his condition, he was removed to the land, where a rude hut had been built to shelter him. In these wretched surroundings he breathed his last.

<p>It is truly a matter of wonder that one man in the short space of ten years (6 May, 1542 - 2 December, 1552) could have visited so many countries, traversed so many seas, preached the Gospel to so many nations, and converted so many infidels. The incomparable <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a> which animated him, and the stupendous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wrought through him, explain this marvel, which has no equal elsewhere. The list of the principal <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> may be found in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>. St. Francis Xavier is considered the greatest missionary since the time of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> he displayed, the wonderful <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> he performed, and the great number of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> he brought to the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith, entitle him to this distinction. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> with <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius</a> in 1622, although on account of the death of <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> was not published until the following year.

<p>The body of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> is still enshrined at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> in the church which formerly belonged to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. In 1614 by order of <a href="../cathen/01109c.htm">Claudius Acquaviva</a>, General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, the right arm was severed at the elbow and conveyed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where the present altar was erected to receive it in the church of the Gesu.
