<h1>St. Francis de Sales</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctor of the Universal Church</a>. born at Thorens, in the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, 21 August, 1567; died at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, 28 December, 1622. His father, Fran&ccedil;ois de Sales de Boisy, and his mother, Fran&ccedil;oise de Sionnaz, belonged to old <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoyard</a> aristocratic <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. The future saint was the eldest of six brothers. His father intended him for the magistracy and sent him at an early age to the colleges of La Roche and <a href="../cathen/01540a.htm">Annecy</a>. From 1583 till 1588 he studied rhetoric and humanities at the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a>, Paris, under the care of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. While there he began a course of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. After a terrible and prolonged temptation to despair, caused by the discussions of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the day on the question of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, from which he was suddenly freed as he <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">knelt</a> before a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> image of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> at St. Etienne-des-Gr&egrave;s, he made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of chastity and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> himself to the Blessed Virgin Mary. In 1588 he studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> <a href="../cathen/12317a.htm">Possevin</a> was his <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a>. He received his diploma of doctorate from the famous Pancirola in 1592. Having been admitted as a lawyer before the senate of <a href="../cathen/03566c.htm">Chamb&eacute;ry</a>, he was about to be appointed senator. His father had selected one of the noblest heiresses of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> to be the partner of his future life, but Francis declared his intention of embracing the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life. A sharp struggle ensued. His father would not consent to see his expectations thwarted. Then Claude de Granier, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, obtained for Francis, on his own initiative, the position of Provost of the Chapter of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, a post in the patronage of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. It was the highest office in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, M. de Boisy yielded and Francis received <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a> (1593).

<p>From the time of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> the seat of the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> had been fixed at <a href="../cathen/01540a.htm">Annecy</a>. There with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a>, the new <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> devoted himself to preaching, hearing <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a>, and the other work of his ministry. In the following year (1594) he volunteered to evangelize Le Chablais, where the Genevans had imposed the Reformed Faith, and which had just been restored to the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. He made his headquarters in the fortress of Allinges. Risking his life, he journeyed through the entire district, preaching constantly; by dint of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, learning, kindness and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> he at last obtained a hearing. He then settled in Thonon, the chief town. He confuted the preachers sent by Geneva to oppose him; he converted the syndic and several prominent <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>. At the request of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, he went to Geneva to interview Theodore Beza, who was called the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The latter received him kindly and seemed for a while shaken, but had not the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to take the final steps. A large part of the inhabitants of Le Chablais returned to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> fold (1597 and 1598). Claude de Granier then chose Francis as his coadjutor, in spite of his refusal, and sent him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1599).

<p><a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Pope Clement VIII</a> ratified the choice; but he wished to examine the candidate personally, in presence of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>. The improvised examination was a triumph for Francis. "Drink, my son", said the Pope to him. "from your cistern, and from your living wellspring; may your waters issue forth, and may they become public fountains where the world may quench its thirst." The prophesy was to be realized. On his return from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the religious affairs of the territory of Gex, a dependency of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, necessitated his going to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. There the coadjutor formed an intimate friendship with <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">Cardinal de B&eacute;rulle</a>, Antoine* Deshayes, secretary of Henry IV, and Henry IV himself, who wished "to make a third in this fair friendship" (<em>&ecirc;tre de tiers dans cette belle amiti&eacute;</em>). The king made him preach the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> at Court, and wished to keep him in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He urged him to continue, by his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> and writings, to teach those <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that had to live in the world how to have confidence in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and how to be genuinely and truly <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> - <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> of which he saw the great necessity.

<p>On the death of Claude de Granier, Francis was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> (1602). His first step was to institute <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instructions for the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, both young and old. He made prudent regulations for the guidance of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. He carefully visited the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> scattered through the rugged mountains of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He reformed the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities. His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, patience and mildness became proverbial. He had an intense <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, especially those who were of respectable <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. His food was plain, his dress and his household simple. He completely dispensed with superfluities and lived with the greatest economy, in order to be able to provide more abundantly for the wants of the needy. He heard confessions, gave advice, and preached incessantly. He wrote innumerable letters (mainly letters of direction) and found time to publish the numerous works mentioned below. Together with <a href="../cathen/08282c.htm">St. Jane Frances de Chantal</a>, he founded (1607) the Institute of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin, for young girls and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> who, feeling themselves called to the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, have not sufficient strength, or lack inclination, for the corporal austerities of the great orders. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> extended beyond the limits of his own diocese. He delivered the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> and <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> discourses which are still famous - those at <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a> (1604), where he first met the Baroness de Chantal; at <a href="../cathen/03566c.htm">Chamb&eacute;ry</a> (1606); at <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a> (1616, 1617, 1618), where he converted the Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal de Lesdigui&egrave;res. During his last stay in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (November, 1618, to September, 1619) he had to go into the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> each day to satisfy the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> wishes of those who thronged to hear him. "Never", said they, "have such holy, such apostolic sermons been preached." He came into contact here with all the distinguished <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> of the day, and in particular with <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>. His friends tried energetically to induce him to remain in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, offering him first the wealthy Abbey of Ste. Genevi&egrave;ve and then the coadjutor-bishopric of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, but he refused all to return to Annecy.



<p>In 1622 he had to accompany the Court of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> into <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. At Lyons he insisted on occupying a small, poorly furnished room in a house belonging to the gardener of the Visitation Convent. There, on 27 December, he was seized with apoplexy. He received the last <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and made his profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, repeating constantly the words: "God's will be done! <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and my all!" He died next day, in the fifty-sixth year of his age. Immense crowds flocked to visit his remains, which the people of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> were anxious to keep in their city. With much difficulty his body was brought back to <a href="../cathen/01540a.htm">Annecy</a>, but his heart was left at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. A great number of wonderful favours have been obtained at his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> in the Visitation Convent of <a href="../cathen/01540a.htm">Annecy</a>. His heart, at the time of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, was carried by the Visitation <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> from <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, where it is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> today. St. Francis de Sales was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> in 1661, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> in 1665; he was proclaimed <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctor of the Universal Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a>, in 1877.

<p>The following is a list of the principal works of the holy Doctor: <dl> <dd>(1) "Controversies", leaflets which the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> missioner scattered among the inhabitants of Le Chablais in the beginning, when these people did not venture to come and hear him preach. They form a complete <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. In the first part, the author defends the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and in the second and third parts, the rules of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which were not observed by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>. The primacy of St. Peter is amply vindicated. <dd>(2) "Defense of the Standard of the Cross", a demonstration of the virtue <ul><li>of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a>; <li>of the Crucifix; <li>of the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">Sign of the Cross</a>; <li>an explanation of the Veneration of the Cross.</ul><dd>(3) "An Introduction to the Devout Life", a work intended to lead "Philothea", the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> living in the world, into the paths of devotion, that is to say, of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and solid <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Every one should strive to become <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, and "it is an error, it is even a heresy", to hold that <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> is incompatible with any state of life. In the first part the author helps the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to free itself from all inclination to, or affection for, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; in the second, he teaches it how to be united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; in the third, he exercises it in the practice of virtue; in the fourth, he strengthens it against temptation; in the fifth, he teaches it how to form its resolutions and to persevere. The "Introduction", which is a masterpiece of <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a>, practical morality, and common sense, was translated into nearly every language even in the lifetime of the author, and it has since gone through innumerable editions. <dd>(4) "Treatise on the Love of God", an authoritative work which reflects perfectly the mind and heart of Francis de Sales as a great genius and a great saint. It contains twelve books. The first four give us a history, or rather explain the theory, of Divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, its birth in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, its growth, its perfection, and its decay and annihilation; the fifth book shows that this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is twofold - the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of complacency and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of benevolence; the sixth and seventh treat of <em>affective</em> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, which is practised in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; the eight and ninth deal with <em>effective</em> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that is, conformity to the will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and submission to His good pleasure. The last three resume what has preceded and teach how to apply practically the lessons taught therein. <dd>(5) "Spiritual Conferences"; familiar conversations on religious virtues addressed to the sisters of the Visitation and collected by them. We find in them that practical common sense, keenness of perception and delicacy of feeling which were characteristic of the kind-hearted and energetic Saint. <dd>(6) "Sermons". - These are divided into two classes: those composed previously to his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and which he himself wrote out in full; and the discourses he delivered when a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, of which, as a rule, only outlines and synopses have been preserved. Some of the latter, however, were taken down <em>in extenso</em> by his hearers. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> proclaiming him <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctor of the Church</a> calls the Saint "The Master and Restorer of Sacred Eloquence". He is one of those who at the beginning of the seventeenth century formed the beautiful <a href="../cathen/06190a.htm">French language</a>; he foreshadows and prepares the way for the great sacred orators about to appear. He speaks simply, naturally, and from his heart. To speak well we need only <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> well, was his maxim. His mind was imbued with the Holy Writings, which he comments, and explains, and applies practically with no less accuracy than grace. <dd>(7) "Letters", mostly letters of direction, in which the minister of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> effaces himself and teaches the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to listen to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> director. The advice given is suited to all the circumstances and necessities of life and to all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of good will. While trying to efface his own <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> in these letters, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> makes himself known to us and unconsciously discovers to us the treasures of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. <dd>(8) A large number of very precious treatises or opuscula. </dl>

<p><a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> (5 vols., quarto) and Viv&egrave;s (12 vols., octavo, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>) have edited the works of St. Francis de Sales. But the edition which we may call definitive was published at <a href="../cathen/01540a.htm">Annecy</a> in 1892, by the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, Dom Mackey: a work remarkable for its typographical execution, the brilliant criticism that settles the text, the large quantity of hitherto unedited matter, and the interesting study accompanying each volume. Dom Mackey published twelve volumes. Father Navatel, S.J., is continuing the work. We may give here a brief r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the spiritual teaching contained in these works, of which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has said: "The writings of Francis de Sales, filled with celestial <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> are a bright light in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, pointing out to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> an easy and safe way to arrive at the <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfection of a Christian life</a>." (Breviarium Romanum, 29 January, lect. VI.)

<p>There are two elements in the spiritual life: first, a struggle against our lower nature; secondly, union of our wills with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in other words, penance and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. St. Francis de Sales looks chiefly to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Not that he neglects penance, which is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, but he wishes it to be practised from a motive of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. He requires <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> of the senses, but he relies first on <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> of the mind, the will, and the heart. This interior <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> he requires to be unceasing and always accompanied by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. The end to be realized is a life of loving, simple, generous, and constant fidelity to the will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is nothing else than our present <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. The model proposed is Christ, whom we must ever keep before our eyes. "You will study His countenance, and perform your actions as He did" (Introd., 2nd part, ch. i). The practical means of arriving at this perfection are: remembrance of the <a href="../cathen/12396a.htm">presence of God</a>, filial <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, a right intention in all our actions, and frequent recourse to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and confiding ejaculations and interior aspirations.

<p>Besides the Institute of the Visitation, which he founded, the nineteenth century has seen associations of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, and several religious congregations, formed under the patronage of the holy Doctor. Among them we may mention the Missionaries of St. Francis de Sales, of <a href="../cathen/01540a.htm">Annecy</a>; the <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesians</a>, founded at <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> by the Venerable Don Bosco, specially devoted to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and technical <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the children of the poorer classes; the <a href="../cathen/11187a.htm">Oblates of St. Francis de Sales</a>, established at <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a> (<a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>) by Father Brisson, who try to realize in the religious and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> life the spirit of the holy Doctor, such as we have described it, and such as he bequeathed it to the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of the Visitation.
