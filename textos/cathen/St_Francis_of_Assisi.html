<h1>St. Francis of Assisi</h1>  

<p>Founder of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a> in Umbria, in 1181 or 1182 &#151; the exact year is uncertain; died there, 3 October, 1226.

<p>His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, Pietro Bernardone, was a <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisian</a> cloth merchant. Of his mother, Pica, little is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, but she is said to have belonged to a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Provence. Francis was one of several children. The <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">legend</a> that he was born in a stable dates from the fifteenth century only, and appears to have originated in the desire of certain writers to make his life resemble that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. At <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> received the <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">name</a> of Giovanni, which his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> afterwards altered to Francesco, through fondness it would seem for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, whither business had led him at the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of his son's birth. In any case, since the child was renamed in infancy, the change can hardly have had anything to do with his aptitude for learning <a href="../cathen/06190a.htm">French</a>, as some have thought.

<p>Francis received some elementary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">instruction</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of St. George's at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, though he learned more perhaps in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the Troubadours, who were just then making for refinement in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. However this may be, he was not very studious, and his literary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> remained incomplete. Although associated with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> in trade, he showed little liking for a merchant's career, and his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> seemed to have indulged his every whim. <a href="../cathen/14694a.htm">Thomas of Celano</a>, his first biographer, speaks in very severe terms of Francis's youth. <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">Certain</a> it is that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> early life gave no presage of the golden years that were to come. No one loved pleasure more than Francis; he had a ready wit, sang merrily, delighted in fine clothes and showy display. Handsome, gay, gallant, and courteous, he soon became the prime favourite among the young nobles of <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, the foremost in every feat of arms, the leader of the civil revels, the very king of frolic. But even at this <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> Francis showed an instinctive sympathy with the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and though he <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">spent money lavishly</a>, it still flowed in such channels as to attest a princely magnanimity of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>.

<p>When about twenty, Francis went out with the townsmen to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">fight</a> the <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugians</a> in one of the petty skirmishes so frequent at that <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> between the rival cities. The <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisians</a> were defeated on this occasion, and Francis, being among those taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>, was held captive for more than a year in <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>. A low fever which he there contracted appears to have turned his thoughts to the things of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; at least the emptiness of the life he had been leading came to him during that long illness. With returning health, however, Francis's eagerness after <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> reawakened and his fancy wandered in search of victories; at length he resolved to embrace a military career, and circumstances seemed to favour his aspirations. A <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a> of <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a> was about to join "the gentle count", Walter of Brienne, who was then in arms in the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan States</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">emperor</a>, and Francis arranged to accompany him. His biographers tell us that the night before Francis set forth he had a strange <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>, in which he saw a vast hall hung with armour all marked with the <a href="../cathen/14517a.htm">Cross</a>. "These", said a voice, "are for you and your soldiers." "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> I shall be a great prince", exclaimed Francis exultingly, as he started for Apulia. But a second illness arrested his course at <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>. There, we are told, Francis had another <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> in which the same voice bade him turn back to <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>. He did so at once. This was in 1205.

<p>Although Francis still joined at times in the noisy revels of his former comrades, his changed demeanour plainly showed that his heart was no longer with them; a yearning for the life of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> had already possessed it. His companions twitted Francis on his absent-mindedness and asked if he were minded to be <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a>. "Yes", he replied, "I am about to take a wife of surpassing fairness." She was no other than <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">Lady Poverty</a> whom <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> and <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a> have wedded to his name, and whom even now he had begun to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. After a short period of uncertainty he began to seek in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/13790a.htm">solitude</a> the answer to his call; he had already given up his gay attire and wasteful ways. One day, while crossing the Umbrian plain on horseback, Francis unexpectedly drew near a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>. The sudden appearance of this repulsive object filled him with disgust and he instinctively retreated, but presently controlling his natural aversion he dismounted, embraced the unfortunate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and gave him all the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">money</a> he had. About the same <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> Francis made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Pained at the miserly <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a> he saw at the <a href="../cathen/13374a.htm">tomb of St. Peter</a>, he emptied his purse thereon. Then, as if to put his fastidious <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to the test, he exchanged clothes with a tattered mendicant and stood for the rest of the day <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> among the horde of beggars at the door of the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">basilica</a>.

<p>Not long after his return to <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, whilst Francis was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> before an ancient <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">crucifix</a> in the forsaken wayside <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Damian's below the town, he <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">heard a voice</a> saying: "Go, Francis, and repair my <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">house</a>, which as you <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is falling into ruin." Taking this behest literally, as referring to the ruinous <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> wherein he <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">knelt</a>, Francis went to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> shop, impulsively bundled together a load of coloured drapery, and mounting his horse hastened to <a href="../cathen/06124b.htm">Foligno</a>, then a mart of some importance, and there sold both horse and stuff to procure the money needful for the restoration of St. Damian's. When, however, the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who officiated there refused to receive the gold thus gotten, Francis flung it from him disdainfully. The elder Bernardone, a most niggardly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">incensed</a> beyond measure at his son's conduct, and Francis, to avert his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, hid himself in a cave near St. Damian's for a whole month. When he emerged from this place of concealment and returned to the town, emaciated with hunger and squalid with dirt, Francis was followed by a hooting rabble, pelted with mud and stones, and otherwise mocked as a <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madman</a>. Finally, he was dragged home by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, beaten, bound, and locked in a dark closet.

<p>Freed by his mother during Bernardone's absence, Francis returned at once to St. Damian's, where he found a shelter with the officiating <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but he was soon cited before the city consuls by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. The latter, not content with having recovered the scattered gold from St. Damian's, sought also to force his son to forego his inheritance. This Francis was only too eager to do; he declared, however, that since he had entered the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> he was no longer under <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil jurisdiction</a>. Having therefore been taken before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Francis stripped himself of the very clothes he wore, and gave them to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, saying: "Hitherto I have called you my father on earth; henceforth I desire to say only <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">'Our Father who art in Heaven'</a>." Then and there, as <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> sings, were solemnized Francis's nuptials with his beloved spouse, the <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">Lady Poverty</a>, under which name, in the <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystical</a> language afterwards so familiar to him, he comprehended the total surrender of all <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">worldly goods</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honours</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privileges</a>. And now Francis wandered forth into the hills behind <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, improvising <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> of praise as he went. "I am the herald of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">great King</a>", he declared in answer to some robbers, who thereupon <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">despoiled</a> him of all he had and threw him scornfully in a snow drift. Naked and half frozen, Francis crawled to a neighbouring <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and there worked for a time as a scullion. At <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">Gubbio</a>, whither he went next, Francis obtained from a friend the cloak, girdle, and staff of a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrim</a> as an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Returning to <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, he traversed the city begging stones for the restoration of St. Damian's. These he carried to the old <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, set in place himself, and so at length rebuilt it. In the same way Francis afterwards restored two other deserted <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, St. Peter's, some distance from the city, and St. Mary of the Angels, in the plain below it, at a spot called the <a href="../cathen/12286a.htm">Porziuncola</a>. Meantime he redoubled his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>, more especially in nursing the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>.

<p>On a certain morning in 1208, probably 24 February, Francis was hearing <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Mary of the Angels, near which he had then built himself a hut; the <a href="../cathen/06659a.htm">Gospel</a> of the day told how the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were to possess neither gold nor silver, nor scrip for their journey, nor two coats, nor shoes, nor a staff, and that they were to exhort <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinners</a> to <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">repentance</a> and announce the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>. Francis took these words as if spoken directly to himself, and so soon as <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> was over threw away the poor fragment left him of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">world's goods</a>, his shoes, cloak, pilgrim staff, and empty wallet. At last he had found his <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">vocation</a>. Having obtained a coarse woolen <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a> of "beast colour", the dress then worn by the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poorest</a> Umbrian peasants, and tied it round him with a knotted rope, Francis went forth at once exhorting the people of the country-side to <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>, brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and peace. The <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisians</a> had already ceased to scoff at Francis; they now paused in wonderment; his example even drew others to him. Bernard of Quintavalle, a magnate of the town, was the first to join Francis, and he was soon followed by Peter of Cattaneo, a well-known <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canon</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> spirit of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">religious enthusiasm</a>, Francis repaired to the church of St. Nicholas and sought to learn <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in their regard by thrice opening at random the book of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> on the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>. Each time it opened at passages where <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> told His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to leave all things and follow Him. "This shall be our rule of life", exclaimed Francis, and led his companions to the public square, where they forthwith gave away all their belongings to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>. After this they procured rough habits like that of Francis, and built themselves small huts near his at the <a href="../cathen/12286a.htm">Porziuncola</a>. A few days later Giles, afterwards the great <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstatic</a> and sayer of "good words", became the third follower of Francis. The little band divided and went about, two and two, making such an impression by their words and behaviour that before long several other <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> grouped themselves round Francis eager to share his <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, among them being Sabatinus, <em>vir bonus et justus</em>, Moricus, who had belonged to the Crucigeri, John of Capella, who afterwards fell away, Philip "the Long", and four others of whom we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> only the <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">names</a>. When the number of his companions had increased to eleven, Francis found it expedient to draw up a written rule for them. This first rule, as it is called, of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> has not come down to us in its original form, but it appears to have been very short and simple, a mere adaptation of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> precepts already selected by Francis for the guidance of his first companions, and which he desired to practice in all their <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfection</a>. When this rule was ready the Penitents of Assisi, as Francis and his followers styled themselves, set out for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to seek the approval of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, although as yet no such <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>. There are differing accounts of Francis's reception by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>. It seems, however, that Guido, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, who was then in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, commended Francis to Cardinal John of St. Paul, and that at the instance of the latter, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> recalled the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> whose first overtures he had, as it appears, somewhat rudely rejected. Moreover, in site of the sinister predictions of others in the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, who regarded the mode of life proposed by Francis as unsafe and impracticable, <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent</a>, moved it is said by a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> in which he beheld the Poor Man of Assisi upholding the tottering <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran</a>, gave a verbal <a href="../cathen/13428a.htm">sanction</a> to the rule submitted by Francis and granted the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> and his companions leave to preach <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">repentance</a> everywhere. Before leaving <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> they all received the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">ecclesiastical tonsure</a>, Francis himself being <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> later on.


<p>After their return to <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> &#151; for thus Francis had named his brethren, either after the <em>minores</em>, or lower classes, as some think, or as others <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, with reference to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#vrs40">Matthew 25:40-45</a>), and as a perpetual reminder of their <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> &#151; found shelter in a deserted hut at Rivo Torto in the plain below the city, but were forced to abandon this poor abode by a rough peasant who drove in his ass upon them. About 1211 they obtained a permanent foothold near <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, through the generosity of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of Monte Subasio, who gave them the little <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Mary of the Angels or the <a href="../cathen/12286a.htm">Porziuncola</a>. Adjoining this humble <a href="../cathen/13431a.htm">sanctuary</a>, already dear to Francis, the first <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> was formed by the erection of a few small huts or cells of wattle, straw, and mud, and enclosed by a hedge. From this settlement, which became the cradle of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> (<em>Caput et Mater Ordinis</em>) and the central spot in the life of St. Francis, the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> went forth two by two exhorting the people of the surrounding country. Like children "careless of the day", they wandered from place to place singing in their joy, and calling themselves the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord's</a> minstrels. The wide world was their <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>; sleeping in haylofts, grottos, or <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">church porches</a>, they toiled with the labourers in the fields, and when none gave them work they would beg. In a short while Francis and his companions gained an immense influence, and men of different grades of life and ways of thought flocked to the order. Among the new recruits made about this time by Francis were the famous Three Companions, who afterwards wrote his life, namely: Angelus Tancredi, a noble cavalier; <a href="../cathen/09173a.htm">Leo</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> secretary and confessor; and Rufinus, a cousin of <a href="../cathen/04004a.htm">St. Clare</a>; besides Juniper, "the renowned jester of the Lord".

<p>During the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> of 1212, a new <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, great as it was unexpected, came to Francis. <a href="../cathen/04004a.htm">Clare</a>, a young heiress of <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, moved by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> preaching at the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. George, sought him out, and begged to be allowed to embrace the new manner of life he had founded. By his advice, <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Clare</a>, who was then but eighteen, secretly left her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> house on the night following <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a>, and with two companions went to the <a href="../cathen/12286a.htm">Porziuncola</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> met her in <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a>, carrying lighted torches. Then Francis, having <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">cut off her hair</a>, clothed her in the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorite</a> habit and thus received her to a life of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">seclusion</a>. <a href="../cathen/04004a.htm">Clare</a> stayed provisionally with some <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> near <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, until Francis could provide a suitable <a href="../cathen/12795b.htm">retreat</a> for her, and for <a href="../cathen/01213a.htm">St. Agnes</a>, her sister, and the other pious <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maidens</a> who had joined her. He eventually established them at St. Damian's, in a dwelling adjoining the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> he had rebuilt with his own hands, which was now given to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> as domicile for his spiritual daughters, and which thus became the first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Second Franciscan Order of Poor Ladies, now known as <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>.

<p>In the autumn of the same year (1212) Francis's burning desire for the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> led him to embark for <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, but having been shipwrecked on the coast of Slavonia, he had to return to <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>. The following spring he devoted himself to evangelizing Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. About this time (1213) Francis received from Count Orlando of Chiusi the mountain of <a href="../cathen/15358a.htm">La Verna</a>, an isolated peak among the <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscan</a> Apennines, rising some 4000 feet above the valley of the Casentino, as a <a href="../cathen/12795b.htm">retreat</a>, "especially favourable for <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>", to which he might retire from time to time for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and rest. For Francis never altogether separated the <a href="../cathen/04329a.htm">contemplative</a> from the active life, as the several hermitages associated with his memory, and the quaint regulations he wrote for those living in them bear witness. At one <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, indeed, a strong desire to give himself wholly to a life of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> seems to have possessed the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. During the next year (1214) Francis set out for <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a>, in another attempt to reach the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">infidels</a> and, if needs be, to shed his blood for the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, but while yet in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> was overtaken by so severe an illness that he was compelled to turn back to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> once more.

<p><a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">Authentic</a> details are unfortunately lacking of Francis's journey to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and sojourn there. It probably took place in the winter of 1214-1215. After his return to Umbria he received several noble and learned men into his order, including his future biographer <a href="../cathen/14694a.htm">Thomas of Celano</a>. The next eighteen months comprise, perhaps, the most obscure period of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> life. That he took part in the <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Lateran Council of 1215</a> may well be, but it is not <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>; we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from <a href="../cathen/05269b.htm">Eccleston</a>, however, that Francis was present at the death of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, which took place at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, in July 1216. Shortly afterwards, i.e. very early in the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>, is placed the concession of the famous <a href="../cathen/12286a.htm">Porziuncola Indulgence</a>. It is related that once, while Francis was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> at the <a href="../cathen/12286a.htm">Porziuncola</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> appeared to him and offered him whatever favour he might desire. The <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> was ever the burden of Francis's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and wishing moreover, to make his beloved <a href="../cathen/12286a.htm">Porziuncola</a> a <a href="../cathen/13431a.htm">sanctuary</a> where many might be saved, he begged a plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> for all who, having <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessed</a> their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, should visit the little <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> acceded to this request on condition that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should ratify the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a>. Francis thereupon set out for <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, with Brother Masseo, to find <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>. The latter, notwithstanding some opposition from the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> at such an unheard-of favour, granted the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a>, restricting it, however, to one day yearly. He subsequently fixed 2 August in perpetuity, as the day for gaining this <a href="../cathen/12286a.htm">Porziuncola Indulgence</a>, commonly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> as <em>il perdono d'Assisi</em>.

<p>Such is the traditional account. The fact that there is no record of this <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> in either the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> or <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/01696a.htm">archives</a> and no allusion to it in the earliest biographies of Francis or other contemporary documents has led some writers to reject the whole story. This <em>argumentum ex silentio</em> has, however, been met by M. Paul Sabatier, who in his critical edition of the "Tractatus de Indulgentia" of <a href="../cathen/02313a.htm">Fra Bartholi</a> has adduced all the really credible evidence in its favour. But even those who regard the granting of this <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> as traditionally <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be an established fact of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history</a>, admit that its early history is uncertain. (<em>See</em> <a href="../cathen/12286a.htm">PORTIUNCULA</a>.)

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/06412b.htm">general chapter</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> was held in May, 1217, at <a href="../cathen/12286a.htm">Porziuncola</a>, the order being divided into provinces, and an apportionment made of the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a> into so many <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> missions. <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, Provence, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> were assigned to five of Francis's principal followers; for himself the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> reserved <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and he actually set out for that kingdom, but on arriving at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, was dissuaded from going further by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Cardinal Ugolino</a>, who had been made <a href="../cathen/03341a.htm">protector</a> of the order in 1216. He therefore sent in his stead <a href="../cathen/11382b.htm">Brother Pacificus</a>, who in the world had been renowned as a poet, together with <a href="../cathen/01212c.htm">Brother Agnellus</a>, who later on established the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Although success came indeed to Francis and his <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, with it came also opposition, and it was with a view to allaying any prejudices the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> might have imbibed against their methods that Francis, at the instance of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Cardinal Ugolino</a>, went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and preached before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran</a>. This visit to the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>, which took place 1217-18, was apparently the occasion of Francis's memorable meeting with <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a>. The year 1218 Francis devoted to missionary tours in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, which were a continual triumph for him. He usually preached out of doors, in the market-places, from <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> steps, from the walls of castle court-yards. Allured by the magic spell of his presence, admiring crowds, unused for the rest to anything like popular preaching in the vernacular, followed Francis from place to place hanging on his lips; <a href="../cathen/02418b.htm">church bells</a> rang at his approach; <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">processions</a> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people advanced to meet him with <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">music</a> and <a href="../cathen/14140c.htm">singing</a>; they brought the sick to him to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> and heal, and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> the very ground on which he trod, and even sought to cut away pieces of his <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a>. The extraordinary enthusiasm with which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was everywhere welcomed was equalled only by the immediate and visible result of his preaching. His exhortations of the people, for sermons they can hardly be called, short, homely, affectionate, and pathetic, touched even the hardest and most frivolous, and Francis became in sooth a very conqueror of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Thus it happened, on one occasion, while the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was preaching at Camara, a small village near <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, that the whole congregation were so moved by his "words of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> and life" that they presented themselves to him in a body and begged to be admitted into his order. It was to accede, so far as might be, to like requests that Francis devised his <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a>, as it is now called, of the Brothers and Sisters of Penance, which he intended as a sort of middle state between the world and the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> for those who could not leave their home or desert their wonted avocations in order to enter either the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">First Order of Friars Minor</a> or the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Second Order of Poor Ladies</a>. That Francis prescribed particular <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> for these <a href="../cathen/14520b.htm">tertiaries</a> is beyond question. They were not to carry arms, or take <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a>, or engage in lawsuits, etc. It is also said that he drew up a formal rule for them, but it is clear that the rule, confirmed by <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a> in 1289, does not, at least in the form in which it has come down to us, represent the original rule of the Brothers and Sisters of Penance. In any event, it is customary to assign 1221 as the year of the foundation of this <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">third order</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> is not <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>.

<p>At the second <a href="../cathen/06412b.htm">general chapter</a> (May, 1219) Francis, bent on realizing his project of evangelizing the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">infidels</a>, assigned a separate mission to each of his foremost <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, himself selecting the seat of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. With eleven companions, including Brother Illuminato and Peter of Cattaneo, Francis set sail from <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a> on 21 June, for <a href="../cathen/01110b.htm">Saint-Jean d'Acre</a>, and he was present at the siege and taking of <a href="../cathen/04615b.htm">Damietta</a>. After preaching there to the assembled <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> forces, Francis fearlessly passed over to the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">infidel</a> camp, where he was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> and led before the sultan. According to the testimony of <a href="../cathen/08266a.htm">Jacques de Vitry</a>, who was with the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> at <a href="../cathen/04615b.htm">Damietta</a>, the sultan received Francis with courtesy, but beyond obtaining a promise from this ruler of more indulgent treatment for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> captives, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> preaching seems to have effected little.

<p>Before returning to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> is believed to have visited Palestine and there obtained for the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> the foothold they still retain as guardians of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places. What is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> is that Francis was compelled to hasten back to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> because of various troubles that had arisen there during his absence. News had reached him in the East that Matthew of Narni and Gregory of Naples, the two <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicars-general</a> whom he had left in charge of the order, had summoned a <a href="../cathen/03582b.htm">chapter</a> which, among other innovations, sought to impose new <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, more severe than the rule required. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Cardinal Ugolino</a> had conferred on the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Ladies</a> a written rule which was practically that of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and Brother Philip, whom Francis had charged with their interests, had accepted it. To make matters worse, John of Capella, one of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> first companions, had assembled a large number of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, with a view to forming them into a new <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, and had set out for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to seek approval for the rule he had drawn up for these unfortunates. Finally a rumour had been spread abroad that Francis was dead, so that when the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> returned to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> with <a href="../cathen/05382a.htm">Brother Elias</a> &#151; he appeared to have arrived at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> in July, 1220 &#151; a general feeling of unrest prevailed among the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>.

<p>Apart from these difficulties, the order was then passing through a period of transition. It had become evident that the simple, familiar, and unceremonious ways which had marked the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> movement at its beginning were gradually disappearing, and that the heroic <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> practiced by Francis and his companions at the outset became less easy as the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> with amazing rapidity increased in number. And this Francis could not help seeing on his return. <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Cardinal Ugolino</a> had already undertaken the task "of reconciling inspirations so unstudied and so free with an order of things they had outgrown." This remarkable man, who afterwards ascended the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne as <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, was deeply attached to Francis, whom he <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> and also, some writers tell us, managed as an enthusiast.

<p>That <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Cardinal Ugolino</a> had no small share in bringing Francis's lofty ideals "within range and compass" seems beyond dispute, and it is not difficult to recognize his hand in the important changes made in the organization of the order in the so-called Chapter of Mats. At this famous assembly, held at <a href="../cathen/12286a.htm">Porziuncola</a> at <a href="../cathen/15614b.htm">Whitsuntide</a>, 1220 or 1221 (there is seemingly much room for <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> and number of the early chapters), about 5000 <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> are said to have been present, besides some 500 applicants for admission to the order. Huts of wattle and mud afforded shelter for this multitude. Francis had purposely made no provision for them, but the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the neighbouring towns supplied them with food, while <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> and nobles waited upon them gladly. It was on this occasion that Francis, harassed no doubt and disheartened at the tendency betrayed by a large number of the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> to relax the rigours of the rule, according to the promptings of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and feeling, perhaps unfitted for a place which now called largely for organizing abilities, relinquished his position as general of the order in favour of Peter of Cattaneo. But the latter died in less than a year, being succeeded as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> by the unhappy <a href="../cathen/05382a.htm">Brother Elias</a>, who continued in that office until the death of Francis.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, meanwhile, during the few years that remained in him, sought to impress on the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> by the silent teaching of personal example of what sort he would fain have them to be. Already, while passing through <a href="../cathen/02639b.htm">Bologna</a> on his return from the East, Francis had refused to enter the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> there because he had heard it called the "House of the Friars" and because a <em>studium</em> had been instituted there. He moreover bade all the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, even those who were ill, quit it at once, and it was only some <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> after, when <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Cardinal Ugolino</a> had publicly declared the house to be his own <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, that Francis suffered his brethren to re-enter it. Yet strong and definite as the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> convictions were, and determinedly as his line was taken, he was never a slave to a theory in regard to the observances of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> or anything else; about him indeed, there was nothing narrow or fanatical. As for his attitude towards study, Francis desiderated for his <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> only such <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as was conformable to the mission of the order, which was before all else a mission of example. Hence he regarded the accumulation of books as being at variance with the <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> his <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> professed, and he resisted the eager desire for mere book-learning, so prevalent in his <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, in so far as it struck at the roots of that simplicity which entered so largely into the essence of his life and ideal and threatened to stifle the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, which he accounted preferable to all the rest.

<p>In 1221, so some writers tell us, Francis drew up a new rule for the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>. Others regard this so-called Rule of 1221 not as a new rule, but as the first one which <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent</a> had orally approved; not, indeed, its original form, which we do not possess, but with such additions and modifications as it has suffered during the course of twelve years. However this may be, the composition called by some the Rule of 1221 is very unlike any conventional rule ever made. It was too lengthy and unprecise to become a formal rule, and two years later Francis retired to Fonte Colombo, a hermitage near <a href="../cathen/13054a.htm">Rieti</a>, and rewrote the rule in more compendious form. This revised draft he entrusted to <a href="../cathen/05382a.htm">Brother Elias</a>, who not long after declared he had lost it through <a href="../cathen/10737b.htm">negligence</a>. Francis thereupon returned to the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">solitude</a> of Fonte Colombo, and recast the rule on the same lines as before, its twenty-three chapters being reduced to twelve and some of its <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> being modified in certain details at the instance of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Cardinal Ugolino</a>. In this form the rule was solemnly approved by <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>, 29 November, 1223 (Litt. "Solet annuere"). This Second Rule, as it is usually called or <em>Regula Bullata</em> of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>, is the one ever since professed throughout the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">First Order of St. Francis</a> (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/06208a.htm">RULE OF SAINT FRANCIS</a>). It is based on the three <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">obedience</a>, <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, special stress however being laid on <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, which Francis sought to make the special characteristic of his order, and which became the sign to be contradicted. This <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of absolute <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> in the first and second orders and the reconciliation of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> with the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">secular</a> state in the Third Order of Penance are the chief novelties introduced by Francis in <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> regulation.

<p>It was during <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmastide</a> of this year (1223) that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of celebrating the <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Nativity</a> "in a new manner", by reproducing in a <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> at Greccio the <em>praesepio</em> of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, and he has thus come to be regarded as having inaugurated the <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">popular devotion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">Crib</a>. <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> appears indeed to have been the favourite <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of Francis, and he wished to persuade the <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">emperor</a> to make a special <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> should then provide well for the <a href="../cathen/02576b.htm">birds</a> and the beasts, as well as for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, so that all might have occasion to rejoice in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.

<p>Early in August, 1224, Francis retired with three companions to "that rugged rock 'twixt Tiber and Arno", as <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> called <a href="../cathen/15358a.htm">La Verna</a>, there to keep a forty days <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a> in preparation for Michaelmas. During this <a href="../cathen/12795b.htm">retreat</a> the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">sufferings of Christ</a> became more than ever the burden of his <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">meditations</a>; into few <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, perhaps, had the full meaning of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> so deeply entered. It was on or about the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the Exaltation of the Cross (14 September) while <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> on the mountainside, that he beheld the marvellous <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">seraph</a>, as a sequel of which there appeared on his body the <a href="../cathen/14294b.htm">visible marks of the five wounds of the Crucified</a> which, says an early writer, had long since been impressed upon his heart. <a href="../cathen/09173a.htm">Brother Leo</a>, who was with St. Francis when he received the <a href="../cathen/14294b.htm">stigmata</a>, has left us in his note to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> autograph <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, preserved at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, a clear and simple account of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, which for the rest is better attested than many another historical fact. The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> right side is described as bearing on open wound which looked as if made by a lance, while through his hands and feet were black nails of flesh, the points of which were bent backward. After the reception of the <a href="../cathen/14294b.htm">stigmata</a>, Francis suffered increasing pains throughout his frail body, already broken by continual <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>. For, condescending as the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> always was to the weaknesses of others, he was ever so unsparing towards himself that at the last he felt constrained to ask pardon of "Brother Ass", as he called his body, for having treated it so harshly. Worn out, moreover, as Francis now was by eighteen years of unremitting toil, his strength gave way completely, and at times his eyesight so far failed him that he was almost wholly blind.

<p>During an excess of anguish, Francis paid a last visit to <a href="../cathen/04004a.htm">St. Clare</a> at St. Damian's, and it was in a little hut of reeds, made for him in the garden there, that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> composed that "Canticle of the Sun", in which his poetic genius expands itself so gloriously. This was in September, 1225. Not long afterwards Francis, at the urgent instance of <a href="../cathen/05382a.htm">Brother Elias</a>, underwent an unsuccessful operation for the eyes, at <a href="../cathen/13054a.htm">Rieti</a>. He seems to have passed the winter 1225-26 at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, whither he had been taken for further <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medical</a> treatment. In April, 1226, during an interval of improvement, Francis was moved to <a href="../cathen/04401a.htm">Cortona</a>, and it is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have been while resting at the hermitage of the Celle there, that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> dictated his testament, which he describes as a "reminder, a warning, and an exhortation". In this touching document Francis, writing from the fullness of his heart, urges anew with the simple eloquence, the few, but clearly defined, principles that were to guide his followers, implicit <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">obedience</a> to superiors as holding the place of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, literal observance of the <a href="../cathen/06208a.htm">rule</a> "without gloss", especially as regards <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of <a href="../cathen/08719a.htm">manual labor</a>, being solemnly enjoined on all the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>.

<p>Meanwhile alarming dropsical symptoms had developed, and it was in a dying <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> that Francis set out for <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>. A roundabout route was taken by the little caravan that escorted him, for it was <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">feared</a> to follow the direct road lest the saucy <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugians</a> should attempt to carry Francis off by force so that he might die in their city, which would thus enter into possession of his coveted <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. It was therefore under a strong guard that Francis, in July, 1226, was finally borne in safety to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> palace in his native city amid the enthusiastic rejoicings of the entire populace. In the early autumn Francis, feeling the hand of death upon him, was carried to his beloved <a href="../cathen/12286a.htm">Porziuncola</a>, that he might breathe his last sigh where his <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">vocation</a> had been <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">revealed</a> to him and whence his order had struggled into sight. On the way thither he asked to be set down, and with painful effort he invoked a beautiful <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> on <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, which, however, his eyes could no longer discern. The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> last days were passed at the <a href="../cathen/12286a.htm">Porziuncola</a> in a tiny hut, near the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, that served as an infirmary. The arrival there about this time of the Lady Jacoba of Settesoli, who had come with her two sons and a great retinue to bid Francis farewell, caused some consternation, since <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were forbidden to enter the friary. But Francis in his tender gratitude to this <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> noblewoman, made an exception in her favour, and "Brother Jacoba", as Francis had named her on account of her <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, remained to the last.

<p>On the <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">eve</a> of his death, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, in imitation of his <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Divine Master</a>, had bread brought to him and broken. This he distributed among those present, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> Bernard of Quintaville, his first companion, <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>, his <a href="../cathen/15401a.htm">vicar</a>, and all the others in order. "I have done my part," he said next, "may <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> teach you to do yours." Then wishing to give a last token of detachment and to show he no longer had anything in common with the world, Francis removed his <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> habit and lay down on the bare ground, covered with a borrowed cloth, rejoicing that he was able to keep faith with his <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">Lady Poverty</a> to the end. After a while he asked to have read to him the <a href="../bible/joh018.htm">Passion according to St. John</a>, and then in faltering tones he himself intoned <a href="../bible/psa141.htm">Psalm 141</a>. At the concluding verse, "Bring my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> out of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>", Francis was led away from earth by "Sister Death", in whose praise he had shortly before added a new strophe to his "Canticle of the Sun". It was Saturday evening, 3 October, 1226, Francis being then in the forty-fifth year of his age, and the twentieth from his <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a> <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> had, in his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, it is said, expressed a wish to be <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> on the Colle d'Inferno, a despised hill without <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, where criminals were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">executed</a>. However this may be, his body was, on 4 October, borne in triumphant <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> to the city, a halt being made at St. Damian's, that <a href="../cathen/04004a.htm">St. Clare</a> and her companions might <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerate</a> the <a href="../cathen/14294b.htm">sacred stigmata</a> now visible to all, and it was placed provisionally in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. George (now within the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">enclosure</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Clare), where the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> had learned to read and had first preached. Many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are recorded to have taken place at his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. Francis was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> at St. George's by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, 16 July, 1228. On that day following the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> laid the first stone of the great double church of St. Francis, erected in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the new <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, and thither on 25 May, 1230, Francis's remains were secretly transferred by <a href="../cathen/05382a.htm">Brother Elias</a> and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> far down under the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">lower church</a>. Here, after <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lying</a> hidden for six centuries, like that of <a href="../cathen/04004a.htm">St. Clare's</a>, Francis's coffin was found, 12 December, 1818, as a result of a toilsome search lasting fifty-two nights. This discovery of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> body is commemorated in the order by a special <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">office</a> on 12 December, and that of his translation by another on 25 May. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept throughout the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on 4 October, and the impression of the <a href="../cathen/14294b.htm">stigmata</a> on his body is celebrated on 17 September.

<p>It has been said with pardonable warmth that Francis entered into <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in his lifetime, and that he is the one <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> whom all succeeding generations have agreed in <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonizing</a>. <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">Certain</a> it is that those also who care little about the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">order</a> he founded, and who have but scant sympathy with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to which he ever gave his devout allegiance, even those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> to be Divine, find themselves, instinctively as it were, looking across the ages for guidance to the wonderful Umbrian Poverello, and invoking his <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">name</a> in grateful remembrance. This unique position Francis doubtless owes in no small measure to his singularly lovable and winsome <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>. Few <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> ever exhaled "the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> odour of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>" to such a degree as he. There was about Francis, moreover, a <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">chivalry</a> and a poetry which gave to his other-worldliness a quite romantic charm and beauty. Other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have seemed entirely dead to the world around them, but Francis was ever thoroughly in touch with the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> of the age. He delighted in the songs of Provence, rejoiced in the new-born freedom of his native city, and cherished what <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> calls the pleasant sound of his dear land. And this exquisite <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> element in Francis's <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> was the key to that far-reaching, all-embracing sympathy, which may be almost called his characteristic gift. In his heart, as an old chronicler puts it, the whole world found refuge, the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, the sick and the fallen being the objects of his solicitude in a more special manner.

<p>Heedless as Francis ever was of the world's judgments in his own regard, it was always his constant care to respect the opinions of all and to wound the feelings of none. Wherefore he admonishes the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> to use only low and mean tables, so that "if a beggar were to come to sit down near them he might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he was but with his equals and need not blush on account of his <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>." One night, we are told, the friary was aroused by the cry "I am dying." "Who are you", exclaimed Francis arising, "and why are dying?" "I am dying of hunger", answered the voice of one who had been too prone to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. Whereupon Francis had a table laid out and sat down beside the famished <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friar</a>, and lest the latter might be ashamed to eat alone, ordered all the other brethren to join in the repast. Francis's devotedness in consoling the afflicted made him so condescending that he shrank not from abiding with the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> in their loathly lazar-houses and from eating with them out of the same platter.

<p>But above all it is his dealings with the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erring</a> that reveal the truly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> of his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. "<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">Saintlier</a> than any of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>", writes <a href="../cathen/14694a.htm">Celano</a>, "among <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinners</a> he was as one of themselves". Writing to a certain <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> in the order, Francis says: "Should there be a brother anywhere in the world who has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> how great soever his fault may be, let him not go away after he has once seen thy face without showing pity towards him; and if he seek not mercy, ask him if he does not desire it. And by this I will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and me." Again, to <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> notions of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> the evil-doer was beyond the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and there was no need to keep faith with him. But according to Francis, not only was <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> due even to evil-doers, but <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> must be preceded by courtesy as by a herald. Courtesy, indeed, in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> quaint concept, was the younger sister of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and one of the qualities of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, Who "of His courtesy", he declares, "gives His sun and His rain to the just and the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>". This <a href="../cathen/07475c.htm">habit of courtesy</a> Francis ever sought to enjoin on his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. "Whoever may come to us", he writes, "whether a friend or a foe, a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> or a robber, let him be kindly received", and the feast which he spread for the starving brigands in the forest at Monte Casale sufficed to show that "as he taught so he wrought".

<p>The very animals found in Francis a tender friend and protector; thus we find him pleading with the people of <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">Gubbio</a> to feed the fierce wolf that had ravished their flocks, because through hunger "Brother Wolf" had done this wrong. And the early <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">legends</a> have left us many an idyllic picture of how beasts and <a href="../cathen/02576b.htm">birds</a> alike susceptible to the charm of Francis's gentle ways, entered into loving companionship with him; how the <a href="../cathen/07563c.htm">hunted</a> leveret sought to attract his notice; how the half-frozen bees crawled towards him in the winter to be fed; how the wild falcon fluttered around him; how the nightingale sang with him in sweetest content in the ilex grove at the Carceri, and how his "little brethren the <a href="../cathen/02576b.htm">birds</a>" listened so devoutly to his sermon by the roadside near Bevagna that Francis chided himself for not having thought of preaching to them before. Francis's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of nature also stands out in bold relief in the world he moved in. He delighted to commune with the wild flowers, the crystal spring, and the friendly fire, and to greet the sun as it rose upon the fair Umbrian vale. In this respect, indeed, St. Francis's "gift of sympathy" seems to have been wider even than <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a>, for we find no evidence in the great <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for nature or for animals.

<p>Hardly less engaging than his boundless sense of fellow-feeling was Francis's downright sincerity and artless simplicity. "Dearly beloved," he once began a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermon</a> following upon a severe illness, "I have to confess to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and you that during this <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> I have eaten cakes made with lard." And when the guardian insisted for the sake of warmth upon Francis having a fox skin sewn under his worn-out <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consented</a> only upon <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> that another skin of the same size be sewn outside. For it was his singular study never to hide from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. "What a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," he was wont to repeat, "so much he is and no more" &#151; a saying which passed into the <a href="../cathen/07674c.htm">"Imitation"</a>, and has been often quoted.

<p>Another winning trait of Francis which inspires the deepest affection was his unswerving directness of purpose and unfaltering following after an ideal. "His dearest desire so long as he lived", <a href="../cathen/14694a.htm">Celano</a> tells us, "was ever to seek among wise and simple, <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a> and imperfect, the means to walk in the way of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." To Francis <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truest</a> of all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>; hence his deep sense of personal responsibility towards his fellows. The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and Him Crucified permeated the whole life and <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> of Francis, and he placed the chief <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> and redress for a suffering <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">humanity</a> in the literal imitation of his <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Divine Master</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> imitated the example of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as literally as it was in him to do so; barefoot, and in absolute <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, he proclaimed the reign of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. This heroic imitation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> was perhaps the distinctive mark of Francis's <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">vocation</a>, and he was undoubtedly, as <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> expresses it, the most ardent, enthusiastic, and desperate lover of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> the world has yet seen. After <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">money</a> Francis most detested discord and divisions. Peace, therefore, became his watchword, and the pathetic reconciliation he effected in his last days between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> and Potesta of <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a> is bit one instance out of many of his power to quell the storms of passion and restore tranquility to hearts torn asunder by civil strife. The <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of a servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Francis declared, was to lift up the hearts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and move them to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>. Hence it was not "from <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/14243a.htm">stalls</a> or with the careful irresponsibility of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">enclosed</a> student" that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> and his followers addressed the people; "they dwelt among them and grappled with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of the system under which the people groaned". They worked in return for their fare, doing for the lowest the most menial labour, and speaking to the poorest words of <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> such as the world had not heard for many a day. In this wise Francis bridged the chasm between an aristocratic <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the common people, and though he taught no new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, he so far repopularized the old one given on the Mount that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> took on a new life and called forth a new <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.

<p>Such in briefest outline are some of the salient features which render the figure of Francis one of such supreme attraction that all manner of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> feel themselves drawn towards him, with a sense of personal attachment. Few, however, of those who feel the charm of Francis's <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> may follow the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> to his lonely height of rapt communion with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For, however engaging a "minstrel of the Lord", Francis was none the less a profound <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystic</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truest</a> sense of the word. The whole world was to him one luminous ladder, mounting upon the rungs of which he approached and beheld <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is very misleading, however, to portray Francis as living "at a height where <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> ceases to exist", and still further from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to represent the trend of his teaching as one in which <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> is made subservient to "humanitarianism". A very cursory inquiry into Francis's <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> suffices to show that it embraced the entire <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, nothing more or less. If then the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> were on the whole <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a>, it was less because he preached to meet the wants of his day, and those whom he addressed had not strayed from <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; they were still "hearers", if not "doers", of the Word. For this reason Francis set aside all questions more theoretical than practical, and returned to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.

<p>Again, to see in Francis only the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> friend of all <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> creatures, the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyous</a> singer of nature, is to overlook altogether that aspect of his work which is the explanation of all the rest &#151; its <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> side. Few lives have been more wholly imbued with the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, as even Renan admits. Nowhere, perhaps, can there be found a keener insight into the innermost world of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>, yet so closely were the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> and the natural blended in Francis, that his very <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">asceticism</a> was often clothed in the guide of romance, as witness his wooing the <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">Lady Poverty</a>, in a sense that almost ceased to be figurative. For Francis's singularly vivid <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> was impregnate with the imagery of the <em>chanson de geste</em>, and owing to his markedly dramatic tendency, he delighted in suiting his action to his thought. So, too, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> native turn for the picturesque led him to unite <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a> and nature. He found in all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, however trivial, some reflection of the Divine perfection, and he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> to admire in them the beauty, power, wisdom, and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>. And so it came to pass that he saw <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> even in stones, and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in everything.

<p>Moreover, Francis's simple, childlike <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> fastened on the thought, that if all are from one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> then all are real kin. Hence his <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> of claiming brotherhood with all manner of animate and inanimate objects. The personification, therefore, of the elements in the "Canticle of the Sun" is something more than a mere literary figure. Francis's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of creatures was not simply the offspring of a soft or sentimental disposition; it arose rather from that deep and abiding sense of the <a href="../cathen/12396a.htm">presence of God</a>, which underlay all he said and did. Even so, Francis's habitual <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">cheerfulness</a> was not that of a careless <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or of one untouched by sorrow. None <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnessed</a> Francis's hidden struggles, his long agonies of tears, or his secret wrestlings in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. And if we meet him making dumb-show of music, by playing a couple of sticks like a violin to give vent to his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">glee</a>, we also find him heart-sore with foreboding at the dire dissensions in the order which threatened to make shipwreck of his ideal. Nor were <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> or other weakening maladies of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> wanting to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> at any <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p>Francis's <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">lightsomeness</a> had its source in that entire surrender of everything present and passing, in which he had found the interior liberty of the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; it drew its strength from his intimate union with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, being an extension of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, held a preponderant place in the life of Francis, and he had nothing more at heart than all that concerned the cultus of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. Hence we not only hear of Francis conjuring the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to show befitting respect for everything connected with the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>, but we also see him sweeping out <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, questing <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> for them, and providing them with <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">altar-breads</a> made by himself. So great, indeed, was Francis's reverence for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, because of its relation to the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Adorable Sacrament</a>, that in his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> he never dared to aspire to that dignity.

<p><a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">Humility</a> was, no doubt, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> ruling <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. The idol of an enthusiastic <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">popular devotion</a>, he ever truly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> himself less than the least. Equally admirable was Francis's prompt and docile <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the voice of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> within him, even in the early days of his ill-defined <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> of interpretation failed him. Later on, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, with as clear as a sense of his message as any <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> ever had, yielded ungrudging submission to what constituted <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authority</a>. No reformer, moreover, was ever, less aggressive than Francis. His apostolate embodied the very noblest <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> of reform; he strove to correct abuses by holding up an ideal. He stretched out his arms in yearning towards those who longed for the "better gifts". The others he left alone.

<p>And thus, without strife or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Poor Little Man of Assisi became the means of renewing the youth of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and of imitating the most potent and popular <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> movement since the beginnings of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> this movement had its social as well as its <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> side. That the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis went far towards re-Christianizing <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> is a matter of history. However, Francis's foremost aim was a <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> one. To rekindle the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the world and reanimate the life of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> in the hearts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> &#151; such was his mission. But because St. Francis sought first the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a> and His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, many other things were added unto him. And his own exquisite <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>, as it is called, passing out into the wide world, became an abiding source of inspiration. Perhaps it savours of exaggeration to say, as has been said, that "all the threads of civilization in the subsequent centuries seem to hark back to Francis", and that since his day "the <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic Church</a> is visibly Umbrian".

<p>It would be difficult, none the less, to overestimate the effect produced by Francis upon the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, or the quickening power he wielded on the generations which have succeeded him. To mention two aspects only of his all-pervading influence, Francis must surely be reckoned among those to whom the world of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a> and letters is deeply indebted. <a href="../cathen/12481d.htm">Prose</a>, as Arnold observes, could not satisfy the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> ardent <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so he made poetry. He was, indeed, too little versed in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of composition to advance far in that direction. But his was the first cry of a nascent poetry which found its highest expression in the "Divine Comedy"; wherefore Francis has been styled the precursor of <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>. What the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> did was to teach a people "accustomed to the artificial versification of courtly <a href="../cathen/09026a.htm">Latin</a> and Provencal poets, the use of their native tongue in simple spontaneous <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, which became even more popular with the <em>Laudi</em> and <em>Cantici</em> of his poet-follower <a href="../cathen/08263a.htm">Jacopone of Todi</a>". In so far, moreover, as Francis's <em>repraesentatio</em>, as <a href="../cathen/13400a.htm">Salimbene</a> calls it, of the stable at <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> is the first <a href="../cathen/10348a.htm">mystery-play</a> we hear of in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, he is said to have borne a part in the revival of the <a href="../cathen/14559a.htm">drama</a>. However this may be, if Francis's love of <a href="../cathen/14140c.htm">song</a> called forth the beginnings of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> verse, his life no less brought about the birth of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a>. His story, says Ruskin, became a passionate tradition <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> everywhere with delight. Full of colour, dramatic possibilities, and human interest, the early <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">legend</a> afforded the most popular material for <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> since the <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life of Christ</a>. No sooner, indeed did Francis's figure make an appearance in <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a> than it became at once a favourite subject, especially with the mystical Umbrian School. So <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is this that it has been said we might by following his familiar figure "construct a history of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a>, from the predecessors of <a href="../cathen/03771a.htm">Cimabue</a> down to <a href="../cathen/12771a.htm">Guido Reni</a>, <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05220b.htm">Van Dyck</a>".

<p>Probably the oldest likeness of Francis that has come down to us is that preserved in the <em>Sacro Speco</em> at <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a>. It is said that it was <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> by a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> during the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> visit there, which may have been in 1218. The absence of the <a href="../cathen/14294b.htm">stigmata</a>, halo, and title of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> in this fresco form its chief claim to be considered a contemporary picture; it is not, however, a real portrait in the modern sense of the word, and we are dependent for the traditional presentment of Francis rather on <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">artists'</a> ideals, like the <a href="../cathen/13095a.htm">Della Robbia</a> <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> at the <a href="../cathen/12286a.htm">Porziuncola</a>, which is surely the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <em>vera effigies</em>, as no <a href="../cathen/03095a.htm">Byzantine</a> so-called portrait can ever be, and the graphic description of Francis given by <a href="../cathen/14694a.htm">Celano</a> (Vita Prima, c. lxxxiii). Of less than middle height, we are told, and frail in form, Francis had a long yet cheerful face and soft but strong voice, small brilliant black eyes, dark brown hair, and a sparse <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a>. His person was in no way imposing, yet there was about the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> a delicacy, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and distinction which made him most attractive.

<p>The literary materials for the history of St. Francis are more than usually copious and <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authentic</a>. There are indeed few if any <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> lives more thoroughly documented. We have in the first place the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> own writings. These are not voluminous and were never written with a view to setting forth his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> systematically, yet they bear the stamp of his <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> and are marked by the same unvarying features of his preaching. A few leading thoughts taken "from the words of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>" seemed to him all sufficing, and these he repeats again and again, adapting them to the needs of the different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom he addresses. Short, simple, and informal, Francis's writings breathe the unstudied <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and enforce the same practical <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a>, while they abound in allegories and personification and reveal an intimate interweaving of <a href="../bible/index.html">Biblical</a> phraseology.

<p>Not all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> writings have come down to us, and not a few of these formerly attributed to him are now with greater likelihood ascribed to others. The extant and <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authentic</a> <em>opuscula</em> of Francis comprise, besides the rule of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> and some fragments of the other Seraphic legislation, several letters, including one addressed "to all the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who dwell in the whole world," a series of <a href="../cathen/04435a.htm">spiritual counsels</a> addressed to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, the "Laudes Creaturarum" or "Canticle of the Sun", and some lesser praises, an <a href="../cathen/11527a.htm">Office of the Passion</a> compiled for his own use, and few other orisons which show us Francis even as <a href="../cathen/14694a.htm">Celano</a> saw him, "not so much a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> as <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> itself".

<p>In addition to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> writings the sources of the history of Francis include a number of early <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">bulls</a> and some other diplomatic documents, as they are called, bearing upon his life and work. Then come the biographies properly so called. These include the lives written 1229-1247 by <a href="../cathen/14694a.htm">Thomas of Celano</a>, one of Francis's followers; a joint narrative of his life compiled by <a href="../cathen/09173a.htm">Leo</a>, Rufinus, and Angelus, intimate companions of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, in 1246; and the celebrated <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">legend</a> of <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, which appeared about 1263; besides a somewhat more polemic <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">legend</a> called the "Speculum Perfectionis", attributed to <a href="../cathen/09173a.htm">Brother Leo</a>, the state of which is a matter of controversy. There are also several important thirteenth-century chronicles of the order, like those of <a href="../cathen/08502a.htm">Jordan</a>, <a href="../cathen/05269b.htm">Eccleston</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02498a.htm">Bernard of Besse</a>, and not a few later works, such as the "Chronica XXIV. Generalium" and the "Liber de Conformitate", which are in some sort a continuation of them. It is upon these works that all the later biographies of Francis's life are based.

<p>Recent years have witnessed a truly remarkable upgrowth of interest in the life and work of St. Francis, more especially among non-Catholics, and <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a> has become in consequence the goal of a new race of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. This interest, for the most part literary and academic, is centered mainly in the study of the primitive documents relating to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> history and the beginnings of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>. Although inaugurated some years earlier, this movement received its greatest impulse from the publication in 1894 of Paul Sabatier's "Vie de S. Fran&ccedil;ois", a work which was almost simultaneously crowned by the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a> and place upon the <a href="../cathen/07721a.htm">Index</a>. In spite of the author's entire lack of sympathy with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> standpoint, his biography of Francis bespeaks vast erudition, deep research, and rare critical insight, and it has opened up a new era in the study of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> resources. To further this study an International Society of Franciscan Studies was founded at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a> in 1902, the aim of which is to collect a complete <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of works on <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> history and to compile a catalogue of scattered <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>; several periodicals, devoted to <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> documents and discussions exclusively, have moreover been established in different countries. Although a large literature has grown up around the figure of the <em>Poverello</em> within a short <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, nothing new of essential value has been added to what was already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. The energetic research work of recent years has resulted in the recovery of several important early texts, and has called forth many really fine critical studies dealing with the sources, but the most welcome feature of the modern interest in <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> origins has been the careful re-editing and translating of Francis's own writings and of nearly all the contemporary <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> authorities bearing on his life. Not a few of the controverted questions connected therewith are of considerable import, even to those not especially students of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">legend</a>, but they could not be made intelligible within the limits of the present article. It must suffice, moreover, to indicate only some of the chief works on the life of St. Francis.

<p>The writings of St. Francis have been published in "Opuscula S. P. Francisci Assisiensis" (Quaracchi, 1904); B&ouml;hmer, "Analekten zur Geschichte des Franciscus von Assisi" (T&uuml;bingen, 1904); U. d'Alen&ccedil;on, "Les Opuscules de S. Fran&ccedil;ois d' Assise" (Paris, 1905); Robinson, "The Writings of St. Francis of Assisi" (Philadelphia, 1906).
