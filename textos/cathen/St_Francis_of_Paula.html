<h1>St. Francis of Paula</h1>  

<p>Founder of the Order of Minims; b. in 1416, at Paula, in Calabria, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; d. 2 April, 1507, at <a href="../cathen/12165a.htm">Plessis</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were remarkable for the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of their lives. Remaining childless for some years after their marriage they had recourse to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, especially commending themselves to the intercession of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>. Three children were eventually born to them, eldest of whom was Francis. When still in the cradle he suffered from a swelling which endangered the sight of one of his eyes. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> again had recourse to <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">Francis of Assisi</a>, and made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> that their son should pass an entire year in the "little habit" of St Francis in one of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of his order, a not uncommon practice in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. The child was immediately cured. From his early years Francis showed signs of extraordinary <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, and at the age of thirteen, being admonished by a vision of a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friar</a>, he entered a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> in order to fulfil the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> made by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. Here he gave great edification by his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, his profound <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, and his prompt obedience. At the completion of the year he went with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> on a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and other places of devotion. Returning to Paula he selected a retired spot on his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> estate, and there lived in solitude; but later on he found a more retired dwelling in a cave on the sea coast. Here he remained alone for about six years giving himself to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>.

<p>In 1435 two companions joined him in his retreat, and to accommodate them Francis caused three cells and a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> to be built: in this way the new order was begun. The number of his disciples gradually increased, and about 1454, with the permission of Pyrrhus, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04403a.htm">Cosenza</a>, Francis built a large <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and church. The building of this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was the occasion of a great outburst of enthusiasm and devotion on the part of the people towards Francis: even the nobles carried stones and joined in the work. Their devotion was increased by the many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> wrought in answer to their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. The rule of life adopted by Francis and his religious was one of extraordinary severity. They observed perpetual abstinence and lived in great poverty, but the distinguishing mark of the order was <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. They were to seek to live unknown and hidden from the world. To express this character which he would have his disciples cultivate, Francis eventually obtained from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> that they should be styled Minims, the least of all religious. In 1474 <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> gave him permission to write a rule for his community, and to assume the title of <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">Hermits</a> of St. Francis: this rule was formally approved by <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>, who, however, changed their title into that of Minims. After the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the order, Francis founded several new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in Calabria and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. He also established <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and a third order for people living in the world, after the example of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>.

<p>He had an extraordinary gift of prophecy: thus he foretold the capture of <a href="../cathen/11351c.htm">Otranto</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in 1480, and its subsequent recovery by the King of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. Also he was gifted with discernment of consciences. He was no respecter of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of whatever rank or position. He rebuked the King of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> for his ill-doing and in consequence suffered much <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. When Louis XI was in his last illness he sent an embassy to Calabria to beg the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> to visit him. Francis refused to come nor could he be prevailed upon until the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> ordered him to go. He then went to the king at Plessis-les-Tours and was with him at his death. Charles VIII, Louis's successor, much admired the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> and during his reign kept him near the court and frequently consulted him. This king built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for Minims at <a href="../cathen/12165a.htm">Plessis</a> and another at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on the Pincian Hill. The regard in which Charles VIII held the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was shared by Louis XII, who succeeded to the throne in 1498. Francis was now anxious to return to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, but the king would not permit him, not wishing to lose his counsels and direction. The last three mouths of his life he spent in entire solitude, preparing for death. On <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a> he gathered his community around him and exhorted them especially to have mutual charity amongst themselves and to maintain the rigour of their life and in particular perpetual abstinence. The next day, <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>, he again called them together and gave them his last instructions and appointed a <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. He then received the last <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and asked to have the Passion according to St. John read out to him, and whilst this was being read, his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> passed away. <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> him in 1519. In 1562 the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> broke open his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> and found his body incorrupt. They dragged it forth and burnt it, but some of the bones were preserved by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and enshrined in various churches of his order. The Order of Minims does not seem at any time to have been very extensive, but they had houses in many countries. The definitive rule was approved in 1506 by <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>, who also approved a rule for the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of the order. The feast of St. Francis of Paula is kept by the universal Church on 2 April, the day on which he died.
