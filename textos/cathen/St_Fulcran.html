<h1>St. Fulcran</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lod&egrave;ve; d. 13 February, 1006. According to the biography which Bernard Guidonis, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lod&egrave;ve (d. 1331), has left us his saintly predecessor, Fulcran came of a distinguished <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> himself at an early age to the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, became a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and from his youth led a pure and holy life. When in 949 Theoderich, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lod&egrave;ve, died, Fulcran, notwithstanding his unwillingness, was chosen as his successor and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Narbonne on 4 February of the same year. He was untiring in his efforts to conserve the moral life within his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, especially among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders; he rebuilt many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, among them the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> dedicated to St. Genesius and the church of the Holy Redeemer with the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> attached to it. The poor and the sick were the objects of his special care; for their support he founded <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and endowed others already existing. The following anecdote from his life is worthy of mention. A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Gaul had fallen away from the Faith and had accepted Jewish teachings. When the news reached Fulcran, he exclaimed in an excess of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>: "This <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should be burned!" Shortly afterwards the renegade <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> was actually seized by his incensed flock and delivered up to death by fire. Fulcran was then filled with remorse that by his utterance he should have been the cause of the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate's</a> death, and after doing severe <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">penance</a>, he made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, there to receive <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> for his supposed guilt. After his death he was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Lod&egrave;ve and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a saint. His body, which had been preserved intact, was burned by the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> in 1572, and only a few particles of his remains were saved. He is the second patron of the Diocese of Lod&egrave;ve, and his feast falls on 13th February.
