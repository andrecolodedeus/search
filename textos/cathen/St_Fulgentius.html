<h1>St. Fulgentius</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ecija (Astigi), in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, at the beginning of the seventh century. Like his brothers Leander and Isidore, two <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of Seville, of whom the first was older and the second younger than Fulgentius, he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> himself to the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. A sister of the three was <a href="../cathen/06114b.htm">St. Florentina</a>. Their father Severianus lived at first in Cartagena; he was a Roman, and, according to later though <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> information, an imperial prefect. Exact data regarding the life of Fulgentius are wanting, as he is mentioned only occasionally in contemporary sources. Leander, in his "Libellus" on the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> written for his sister Florentina states that he has sent Fulgentius back to his native town of <a href="../cathen/03384b.htm">Cartagena</a>, which he now regrets as he fears that harm may befall him, and he requests Florentina to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him. What the danger was to which Fulgentius was exposed we have no means of knowing. Probably through the influence of Leander, who was made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a> in the year 584 and who played an important part in the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> kingdom, Fulgentius became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Astigi (Ecija), in the ecclesiastical province of Seville. As Leander died in 600 and Pegasius is shown to have still been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ecija in 590, we may safely assume that Fulgentius was chosen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> between 690 and 600; at all events he already occupied the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 610. Isidore, who succeeded to the Archbishopric of Seville upon the death of his brother Leander, dedicated to Fulgentius "his lord, the servant of God", his work on the offices of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, "De ecclesiasticis officiis". In fact it was at the solicitation of Fulgentius that he wrote this account of the origin and authors of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> services i.e., of the Liturgy.

<p>At the second synod of Seville (619), for which Isidore had assembled the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province of Baetica, a controversy between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Astigi and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a> regarding a church which was claimed by each as belonging to a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was brought up for settlement; a commission was appointed, and it was declared that thirty year's undisturbed possession should constitute a legal title. Fulgentius attended the synod in person, his name being found among the signatures to the Acts of the council. This is the last event in the life of Fulgentius for which we have positive <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. In any case, he died before the year 633, as one Marcianus is shown to have then heen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Astigi. Fulgentius, like his sister and brothers, was reverenced as a saint. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> his feast was celebrated on different days; in the "Acta Sanctorum" of the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> it is on 14 January. He is frequently confused in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> writings with Fulgentius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13230c.htm">Ruspe</a>; some works have also been attributed to him, of which, however, no traces remain. It is said that long after their deaths the bones of St. Fulgentius and those of his sister, <a href="../cathen/06114b.htm">St. Florentina</a>, were carried for safety into the Sierra de Guadalupe, and that in the fourteenth century they were found in the village of Berzocana in those mountains.
