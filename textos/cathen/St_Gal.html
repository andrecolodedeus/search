<h1>St. Gal</h1>  

<p>Of the ninety-eight <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who have occupied the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont-Ferrand</a> (Auvergne) the sixteenth and twenty-third bore the name of Gal, and both are numbered among the twenty-nine <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of this church who are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. The first and most illustrious was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from 527 to 551, the second, form 640 to 650. Born of a senatorial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Auvergne, the first St. Gal early embraced the monastic life, and then became councillor to St. Quintianus, who he was to succeed in the <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">See of Clermont</a>. Tierry I, King of Austrasia, having invaded Auvergne, took Gal <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> and attached him to the oratory of his palace. He regained his liberty some years later and returned to Clermont. Quintianus having died, Gal was chosen as his successor in 527. As <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> he was the intrepid defender of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against Sivigald, the governor appointed by Thierry, and after Sivigald's tragic death, the protector of his children from theprince's wrath. The chief event of his episcopate was the Council of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> in 535. Fifteen <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the kingdom of Austrasia assisted at it under the presidency of Honoratus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>. They drew up seventeen canons, of which the first sixteen are contained in the Decretum of Gratian, and have become <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the universal Church. The following is a summary of the most remarkable: <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are prohibited from submitting to the deliberations of councils any private or temporal affairs, before having dealt with matters regarding discipline; <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> are forbidden to appeal to seculars in their disputes with <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is pronounced against <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who solicit the protection of princes in order to obtain the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a>, or who cause forged decrees of election to be signed. The council also declares itself forcibly against the marriages of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> with <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, marriages between relatives, and the misconduct of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In 541 Gal took part in the fourth Council of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, which <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> energetic decrees for the abolition of slavery, and in 549 in the fifth, which condemned the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a> and Nestorius. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 3 July.

<p>The second St. Gal succeed St. C&aelig;sarius; he was a man of great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, and was one of the most eminent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>. Little, however, is known of his life. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept 1 November.
