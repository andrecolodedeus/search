<h1>St. Gaspare del Bufalo</h1>  

<p>Founder of the <a href="../cathen/12373c.htm">Missionaries of the Most Precious Blood</a> (C.P.P.S.); b. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05504c.htm">Epiphany</a>, 1786; d. 28 December, 1837.

<p>His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were Antonio del Bufalo, chief cook of the princely <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Altieri, and his wife Annunziata Quartieroni. Because of his delicate health, his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> mother had him confirmed at the tender age of one and a half years (1787). As he was suffering from an incurable malady of the eyes, which threatened to leave him blind, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were offered to <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> for his recovery. In 1787, he was <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> cured, wherefore he cherished in later life a special devotion to the great Apostle of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and selected him as the special <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron</a> of the congregation which he founded. From his earliest years he had a great horror of even venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and showed deep <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, a spirit of <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, remarkable control over his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> inclinations (especially his innate irascibility and strong self-will), and also heroic <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> and the miserable. Having entered the Collegium Romanum at the age of twelve he received in 1800 first <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>, and one year later the four <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>. As <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instructor at St. Mark's, his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> won for him the name "The Little Apostle of Rome", and when but nineteen years old, he was appointed president of the newly instituted <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Santa Maria del Pianto.

<p>After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> (31 July, 1808), he obtained a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> at St. Mark's, and soon instituted with Gaetano Bonani a nocturnal <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratory</a>. He assisted Francesco Albertini in founding the <a href="../cathen/12373b.htm">Archconfraternity of the Most Precious Blood</a>, and worked with great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in the poorer districts of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, preaching frequently in the market-places. In 1810 he was summoned before General Miollis to swear allegiance to <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>. But neither threats nor promises could induce him to do so, because <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> had forbidden it. The words with which he announced his final decision have become famous: "Non posso, non debbo, non voglio" (I cannot, I ought not; I will not). In consequence he suffered banishment, and later on <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> in the foul dungeons of <a href="../cathen/07692a.htm">Imola</a> and Rocca (1810-1814). After <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> fall he returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, intending to enter the re-established <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Order</a>. But obeying his <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual adviser</a>, Albertini, he founded a congregation of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> to give missions and spread <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12372c.htm">Most Precious Blood</a>. Through Cardinal Cristaldi he obtained the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/13428a.htm">sanction</a> and, as a mother-house, the former <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of San Felice in Giano. Of this he took <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> possession, 11 August, 1815. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> says, "Through Umbria, Aemilia, Picenum, <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, Campania, Samnium, in short all the provinces ot Middle <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> he wandered, giving missions". The very titles accorded to him by his contemporaries speak volumes: "II Santo", "Apostle of Rome", "Il martello dei Carbonari" (Hammer of <a href="../cathen/03330c.htm">Italian Freemasonry</a>).

<p>How arduous some of his missions were may be gleaned from the fact that he frequently preached five times daily, sometimes even oftener. At <a href="../cathen/13452a.htm">Sanseverino</a> fifty <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were not sufficient to hear <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a> after his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a>. Though idolized by the people, he was not without enemies. His activity in converting the "briganti", who came in crowds and laid their guns at his feet after he had preached to them in their mountain hiding-places, excited the ire of the officials who profited from brigandage through <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a> and in other ways. These enemies almost induced <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> to <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspend</a> del Bufalo. But after a personal conference, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> dismissed him, remarking to his courtiers, "Del Bufalo is an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>". His enemies next tried to remove him from his post by procuring his promotion as "internuncio to <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>". In vain, however, for his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> triumphed. A last attempt under <a href="../cathen/12134a.htm">Pius VIII</a> (1830) met with temporary success. Del Bufalo was deprived of faculties for a short <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, and his congregation threatened with extinction. But his wonderful <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> again manifested itself, and, though himself misjudged and his life-work menaced by the very authority that should have supported him, he showed no signs of resentment, forgave his enenies, and excused his unmerited condemnation. The storm soon passed, Gaspare was restored to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and resumed his work with renewed <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>.

<p>In 1836 his strength began to fail. Although fatally ill, he hastened to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where the cholera was raging, to administer to the spiritual wants of the plague-stricken. It proved too much for him, and he succumbed in the midst of his labours on 28 Dec., 1837. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> on 29 Aug., 1904. <span class="stiki">He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Pope Pius XII in 1954.</span>
