<h1>St. Gaudentius</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a> from about 387 until about 410; he was the successor of the writer on <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, <a href="../cathen/11797a.htm">St. Philastrius</a>. At the time of that saint's death Gaudentius was making a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Jerusalem. The people of <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a> bound themselves by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> that they would accept no other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> than Gaudentius; and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> and other neighbouring <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, in consequence, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> him to return, though against his will. The Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> also threatened to refuse him Communion if he did not obey. We possess the discourse which he made before St. Ambrose and other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> on the occasion of his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, in which he excuses, on the plea of obedience, his youth and his presumption in speaking. He had brought back with him from the East many precious <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. John Baptist and of the Apostles, and especially of the Forty Martyrs of <a href="../cathen/13667a.htm">Sebaste</a>, <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of whom he had received at Caesarea in Cappadocia from nieces of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>. These and other <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> from <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and elsewhere he deposited in a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> which he named <em>Concilium Sanctorum</em>. His sermon on its dedication is extant. From a letter of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> (Ep. clxxxiv) to Gaudentius it may be gathered that the two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> had met at Antioch. When St. Chrysostom had been condemned to exile and had appealed to <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Pope Innocent</a> and the West in 405, Gaudentius warmly took his part. An embassy to the Eastern Emperor Arcadius from his brother Honorius and from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, bearing letters frorn both and from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, consisted of Gaudentius and two other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The envoys were seized at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> and sent to Constantinople, being three days on a ship without food. They were not admitted into the city, but were shut up in a fortress called Athyra, on the coast of Thrace. Their credentials were seized by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">force</a>, so that the thumb of one of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was broken, and they were offered a large sum of money if they would communicate with Atticus, who had supplanted St. Chrysostom. They were consoled by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> appeared to a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> amongst them. They were eventually put on board an unseaworthy vessel, and it was said that the captain had orders to wreck them. However, they arrived safe at <a href="../cathen/08770b.htm">Lampsacus</a>, where they took ship for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and arrived in twenty days at <a href="../cathen/11351c.htm">Otranto</a>. Their own account of their four months' adventures has been preserved to us by <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a> (Dialogus, 4). St. Chrysostom wrote them several grateful letters.

<p>We possess twenty-one genuine tractates by Gaudentius. The first ten are a series of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> sermons, written down after delivery at the request of Benivolus, the chief of the <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescian</a> nobility, who had been prevented by ill health from hearing them delivered. In the preface Gaudentius takes occasion to disown all unauthorized copies of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> published by shorthand writers. These pirated editions seem to have been known to Rufinus, who, in the dedication to St. Gaudentius of his translation of the pseudo-Clementine "Recognitions", praises the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> gifts of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>, saying that even his extempore speaking is worthy of publication and of preservation by posterity. The style of Gaudentius is simple, and his matter is good. His body lies at <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a> in the Church of St. John Baptist, on the site of the Concilium Sanctorum. His figure is frequently seen in the altar-pieces of the great <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>, <a href="../cathen/02678b.htm">Moretto</a>, Savoldo, and Romanino. The best edition of his works is by Galeardi (Padua, 1720, and in P.L., XX).
