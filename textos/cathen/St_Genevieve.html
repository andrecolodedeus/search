<h1>St. Genevieve</h1>  

<p>Patroness of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, b. at Nanterre, c. 419 or 422; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 512. Her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 3 January. She was the daughter of Severus and Gerontia; popular tradition represents her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> as poor peasants, though it seems more likely that they were wealthy and respectable townspeople. In 429 St. Germain of Auxerre and St. Lupus of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a> were sent across from Gaul to Britain to combat <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>. On their way they stopped at Nanterre, a small village about eight miles from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The inhabitants flocked out to welcome them, and St. Germain preached to the assembled multitude. It chanced that the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> demeanour and thoughtfulness of a young girl among his hearers attracted his attention. After the sermon he caused the child to be brought to him, spoke to her with interest, and encouraged her to persevere in the path of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Learning that she was anxious to devote herself to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he interviewed her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and foretold them that their child would lead a life of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and by her example and instruction bring many virgins to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> themselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Before parting next morning he saw her again, and on her renewing her <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> he blessed her and gave her a <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medal</a> engraved with a cross, telling her to keep it in remembrance of her dedication to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. He exhorted her likewise to be content with the <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medal</a>, and wear it instead of her pearls and golden ornaments. There seem to have been no <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> near her village; and Genevieve, like so many others who wished to practise religious virtue, remained at home, leading an innocent, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayerful</a> life. It is uncertain when she formally received the religious veil. Some writers assert that it was on the occasion of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory's</a> return from his mission to Britain; others say she received it about her sixteenth year, along with two companions, from the hands of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. On the death of her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> she went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and lived with her godmother. She devoted herself to <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a> and practised severe corporal austerities, abstaining completely from flesh meat and breaking her fast only twice in the week. These <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortifications</a> she continued for over thirty years, till her <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superiors thought it their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to make her diminish her austerities.

<p>Many of her neighbours, filled with jealousy and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, accused Genevieve of being an impostor and a <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrite</a>. Like <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Blessed Joan of Arc</a>, in later times, she had <a href="../cathen/06278a.htm">frequent communion</a> with the other world, but her visions and prophecies were treated as <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">frauds</a> and deceits. Her enemies conspired to drown her; but, through the intervention of Germain of Auxerre, their animosity was finally overcome. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city appointed her to look after the welfare of the virgins dedicated to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and by her instruction and example she led them to a high degree of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. In 451 <a href="../cathen/02061b.htm">Attila</a> and his Huns were sweeping over Gaul; and the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> prepared to flee. Genevieve encouraged them to hope and trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; she urged them to do works of penance, and added that if they did so the town would be spared. Her exhortations prevailed; the citizens recovered their calm, and <a href="../cathen/02061b.htm">Attila's</a> hordes turned off towards Orl&eacute;ans, leaving <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> untouched. Some years later Merowig (M&eacute;rov&eacute;e) took <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; during the siege Genevieve distinguished herself by her charity and self- sacrifice. Through her influence Merowig and his successors, Childeric and <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a>, displayed unwonted clemency towards the citizens. It was she, too, who first formed the plan of erecting a church in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Saints Peter and Paul. It was begun by <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a> at Mont-l&egrave;s-Paris, shortly before his death in 511. Genevieve died the following year, and when the church was completed her body was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> within it. This fact, and the numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> wrought at her <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, caused the name of Sainte-Genevi&egrave;ve to be given to it. Kings, princes, and people enriched it with their gifts. In 847 it was plundered by the Normans and was partially rebuilt, but was completed only in 1177. This church having fallen into decay once more, Louis XV began the construction of a new church in 1764. The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> broke out before it was dedicated, and it was taken over in 1791, under the name of the Panth&eacute;on, by the Constituent Assembly, to be a burial place for distinguished <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a>. It was restored to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> purposes in 1821 and 1852, having been secularized as a national mausoleum in 1831 and, finally, in 1885. St. Genevieve's <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were preserved in her church, with great devotion, for centuries, and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> received striking <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the efficacy of her intercession. She saved the city from complete inundation in 834. In 1129 a violent plague, known as the <em>mal des ardents,</em> carried off over 14,000 victims, but it ceased suddenly during a procession in her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a>, who had come to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to implore the king's help against the <a href="../cathen/01447a.htm">Antipope Anacletus</a> in 1130, examined personally into the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> and was so convinced of its authenticity that he ordered a feast to be kept annually in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the event on 26 November. A small church, called Sainte-Genevi&egrave;ve des Ardents, commemorated the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> till 1747, when it was pulled down to make room for the Foundling Hospital. The saint's <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were carried in <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> yearly to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and Mme de S&eacute;vign&eacute; gives a description of the pageant in one of her letters.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">revolutionaries of 1793</a> destroyed most of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> preserved in St. Genevieve's church, and the rest were cast to the winds by the mob in 1871. Fortunately, however, a large <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> had been kept at Verneuil, Oise, in the eighteenth century, and is still extant. The church built by <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a> was entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>. In the ninth century they were replaced by secular canons. In 1148, under <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugene III</a> and Louis VII, canons from St. Victor's Abbey at Senlis were introduced. About 1619 Louis XIII named Cardinal Fran&ccedil;ois de La Rochefoucauld <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Genevieve's. The canons had been lax and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> selected Charles Faure to reform them. This holy man was born in 1594, and entered the canons regular at Senlis. He was remarkable for his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and, when <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, succeeded after a hard struggle in reforming the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. Many of the houses of the canons regular adopted his reform. He and a dozen companions took charge of Sainte-Genevi&egrave;ve-du-Mont, at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in 1634. This became the mother-house of a new congregation, the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> of St. Genevieve, which spread widely over <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Another institute called after the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was the Daughters of St. Genevieve, founded at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in 1636, by Francesca de Blosset, with the object of nursing the sick and teaching young girls. A somewhat similar institute, popularly known as the Miramiones, had been founded under the invocation of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, in 1611, by Marie Bonneau de Rubella Beauharnais de Miramion. These two institutes were united in 1665, and the associates called the Canonesses of St. Genevieve. The members took no <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, but merely promised obedience to the rules as long as they remained in the institute. Suppressed during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, it was revived in 1806 by Jeanne-Claude Jacoulet under the name of the Sisters of the Holy Family. They now have charge of over 150 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>.
