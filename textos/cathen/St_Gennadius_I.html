<h1>St. Gennadius I</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople (458-471), has left scarcely any writings. Facundus (Defensio, II, iv) states that he wrote against <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a>, probably in 431-2, and quotes a passage to show that his work was more violent even than the letter of Ibas. If St. Cyril's letter of 434 (Ep. lvi) is to the same Gennadius, they were friends in that year. Gennadius succeeded Anatolius as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantinople in 458. On 17 June, 460, <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo</a> wrote to him (Ep. clxx) warning him against Timothy Aelurus, the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> who had made himself <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>. Not later, it seems, than 459 St. Gennadius celebrated a great council of eighty-one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, many of whom were from the East and even from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, including those who had been dispossessed of their sees by Aelurus. The letter of this council against <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> is still preserved (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, VII, 912). About the same time St. Daniel the Stylite began to live on a column near Constantinople, apparently without the Patriarch's leave, and certainly without the permission of Gelasius, the owner of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> where the pillar stood, who strongly objected to this strange invasion of his land. The Emperor Leo protected the ascetic, and some time later sent St. Gennadius to ordain him <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, which he is said to have done standing at the foot of the column, since St. Daniel objected to being <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, and refused to let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> mount the ladder. At the end of the rite, however, the patriarch ascended to give <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> to the stylite and to receive it from him. Whether he then <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposed his hands</a> on him is not said. Possibly he considered it sufficient to extend them from below towards the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. According to Theodorus Lector, Gennadius would allow no one to become a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> unless he had learned the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> by heart. He made St. Marcian <em>oeconomus</em> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople.

<p>St. Gennadius is said by Joannes Moschus to have been very mild and of great purity. We are told by <a href="../cathen/06417a.htm">Gennadius of Marseilles</a> that he was <em>lingua nitidus et ingenio acer</em>, and so rich in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the ancients that he composed a commentary on the whole Book of Daniel. The continuation of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> Chronicle by <a href="../cathen/09639b.htm">Marcellinus Comes</a> tells us (according to some <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>) that Gennadius commented on all <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a>. Some fragments are collected in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G., LXXXV, chiefly from the two <a href="../cathen/03434a.htm">catenae</a> of Cramer on Romans; a few passages are found in the catena of <a href="../cathen/11214b.htm">Oecumenius</a>, and a few in the <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> gr. 166 (46). Some fragments in the <a href="../cathen/03434a.htm">catenae</a> of Niceohorus show that Gennadius also commented on Genesis. He is seen to have been a learned writer, who followed the Antiochene <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of literal <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>. He is celebrated in the Greek Menaea on 25 Aug. and 17 Nov., and on the former day in the Roman-Martyrology.
