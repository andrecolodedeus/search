<h1>St. Gerard, Bishop of Toul</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, 935; died at Toul, 23 April, 994. Belonging to a <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> and noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, he received an excellent <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and throughout his youth was a model of obedience and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. He was eventually <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, in which office his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> were a source of edification to the city of Cologne. At the death of Gauzelin, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Toul (963), he was appointed to succeed him by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, was well received by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people of Toul, and bore the burdens of his episcopal office without any of its comforts. Although he avoided paying long visits to the court of the Emperor <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a>, who was desirous of keeping Gerard near him, he nevertheless obtained from the emperor the confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a> in virtue of which Toul, although united to the empire about 925, formed an independent state of which the Emperor Henry the Fowler reserved to himself only the protectorate, abandoning to Gerard's predecessor, Gauzelin, the therefore rightly considered as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> founder of the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Toul. He was energetic in his opposition to powerful personages who were inimical to his authority, and governed his county wisely, <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgating</a> administrative measures, traces of which subsisted to the time of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. He died at the age of fifty-nine, and was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> with pomp in the choir of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a>, one of his <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">successors</a> in the See of Toul, <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> him in 1050.
