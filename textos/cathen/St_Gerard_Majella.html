<h1>St. Gerard Majella</h1>  

<p>Born in Muro, about fifty miles south of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, in April, 1726; died 16 October, 1755; <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, 29 January, 1893, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, 11 December, 1904. His only <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> was to be like <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> in his sufferings and humiliations. His father, Dominic Majella, died while Gerard was a child. His <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> mother, owing to poverty, was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to apprentice him to a tailor. His master <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> him, but the foreman treated him cruelly. His reverence for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of suffering led him to take service in the house of a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, who was very hard to please. On the latter's death Gerard returned to his trade, working first as a journeyman and then on his own account. His earnings he divided between his mother and the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and in offerings for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>. After futile attempts first to become a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> and then a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>, he entered the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer</a> in 1749. Two years later he made his profession, and to the usual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> he added one by which he bound himself to do always that which seemed to him more perfect. <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus</a> considered him a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of obedience. He not only obeyed the orders of superiors when present, but also when absent <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> and obeyed their desires. Although weak in body, he did the work of three, and his great charity earned for him the title of Father of the Poor. He was a model of every virtue, and so drawn to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> in the tabernacle that he had to do <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to himself to keep away. An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in purity, he was accused of a shameful crime; but he bore the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> with such patience that St. Alphonsus said: "Brother Gerard is a saint". He was favoured with infused <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the highest order, <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstatsies</a>, prophecy, discernment of spirits, and penetration of hearts, <a href="../cathen/02568a.htm">bilocation</a>, and with what seemed an unlimited power over nature, sickness, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>. When he accompanied the Fathers on missions, or was sent out on business, he converted more <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> than many missionaries. He predicted the day and hour of his death. A wonderworker during his life, he has continued to be the same since his death.
