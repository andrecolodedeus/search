<h1>St. Germain</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Auxerre, born at Auxerre c. 380; died at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, 31 July, 448. He was the son of Rusticus and Germanilla, and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was one of the noblest in Gaul in the latter portion of the fourth century. He received the very best <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> provided by the distinguished <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Arles and Lyons, and then went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he studied eloquence and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>. He practised there before the tribunal of the prefect for some years with great success. His high birth and brilliant talents brought him into contact with the court, and he married Eustachia, a lady highly esteemed in imperial circles. The emperor sent him back to <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, appointing him one of the six dukes, entrusted with the government of the Gallic provinces. He resided at Auxerre and gave himself up to all the enjoyments that naturally fell to his lot. At length he incurred the displeasure of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, St. Amator. It appears that Germain was accustomed to hang the trophies of the chase on a certain tree, which in earlier times had been the scene of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> worship. Amator remonstrated with him in vain. One day when the duke was absent, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had the tree cut down and the trophies burnt. Fearing the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of the duke, who wished to kill him, he fled and appealed to the prefect Julius for permission to confer the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> on Germain. This being granted, Amator, who felt that his own life was drawing to a close, returned. When the duke came to the church, Amator caused the doors to be barred and gave him the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> against his will, telling him to live as one destined to be his successor, and forthwith made him a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>.

<p>A wonderful change was instantly wrought in Germain, and he accepted everything that had happened as the Divine will. He gave himself up to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, study, and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>, and, when in a short time Amator died, Germain was unanimously chosen to fill the vacant see, being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 7 July, 418. His splendid <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> now served him in good stead in the government of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which he administered with great sagacity. He distributed his goods among the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and practised great austerities. He built a large <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> dedicated to Sts. Cosmas and Damian on the banks of the Yonne, whither he was wont to retire in his spare moments. In 429 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Britain sent an appeal to the continent for help against the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who were corrupting the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the island. St. Prosper, who was in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 431, tells us in his Chronicle that Pope Celestine commissioned the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Gaul to send help, and Germain and Lupus of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a> were deputed to cross over to Britain. On his way Germain stopped at Nanterre, where he met a young child, Genevieve, destined to become the patroness of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. One of the early lives of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, Apostle of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, tells us that he formed one of St. Germain's suite on this occasion. Tradition tells us that the main discussion with the representatives of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> took place at <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban's</a>, and resulted in the complete discomfiture of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Germain remained in Britain for some time preaching, and established several <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for the training of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. On his return he went to Arles to visit the prefect, and obtained the remission of certain taxes that were oppressing the people of Auxerre. He constructed a church in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban</a> about this time in his episcopal city.

<p>In 447 he was invited to revisit Britain, and went with Severus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Tr&egrave;ves. It would seem that he did much for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there, if one can judge from the traditions handed down in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>. On one occasion he is said to have aided the Britons to gain a great victory (called from the battle-cry, <em>Alleluia!</em> the <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a> victory) over a marauding body of Saxons and Picts. On his return to <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, he proceeded to Armorica (Brittany) to intercede for the Armoricans who had been in rebellion. Their punishment was deferred at his entreaty, till he should have laid their case before the emperor. He set out for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and reached <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> on 17 June, 448. Then he journeyed to <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, where he interviewed the empress-mother, Galla Placidia, on their behalf. The empress and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city, St. Peter Chrysologus, gave him a royal welcome, and the pardon he sought was granted. While there he died on 31 July, 450. His body, as he requested when dying, was brought back to Auxerre and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the Oratory of <a href="../cathen/10068c.htm">St. Maurice</a>, which he had built. Later the oratory was replaced by a large church, which became a celebrated <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> known as St. Germain's. This tribute to the memory of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was the gift of Queen Clotilda, wife of <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a>. Some centuries later, Charles the Bald had the shrine opened, and the body was found intact. It was embalmed and wrapped in precious cloths, and placed in a more prominent position in the church. There it was preserved till 1567, when Auxerre was taken by the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>, who <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecrated</a> the shrine and cast out the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. It has been said that the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were afterwards picked up and placed in the Abbey of St. Marion on the banks of the Yonne, but the authenticity of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> in this church has never been canonically recognized. St. Germain was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in Cornwall and at <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban's</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England's</a> pre-reformation days, and has always been the patron of Auxerre.
