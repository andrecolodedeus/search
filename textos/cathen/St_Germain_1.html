<h1>St. Germain</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; born near <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, Sa&ocirc;ne-et-Loire, c. 496; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 28 May, 576. He studied at Avalon and also at Luzy under the guidance of his cousin Scapilion, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. At the age of thirty-four he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by St. Agrippinus of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a> and became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Saint-Symphorien near that town. His characteristic virtue, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, manifested itself so strongly in his alms-giving, that his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, fearing he would give away everything, rebelled. As he happened to be in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in 555, when Bishop Eusebius died, Childebert kept him, and with the unanimous consent of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the vacant see. Under his influence the king, who had been very worldly was reformed and led a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life. In his new state the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> continued to practise the virtues and austerities of his monastic life and laboured hard to diminish the evils caused by the incessant <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and the licence of the nobles. He attended the Third and Fourth Councils of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (557, 573) and also the Second Council of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> (566). He persuaded the king to stamp out the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> practices still existing in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> and to forbid the excess that accompanied the celebration of most <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">Christian festivals</a>. Shortly after 540 Childebert making <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, besieged Saragossa. The inhabitants had placed themselves under the protection of St. Vincent, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. Childebert learning this, spared the city and in return the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> presented him with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> stole. When he came back to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, the king caused a church to be erected in the suburbs in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> to receive the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a>. Childebert fell dangerously ill about this time, at his palace of Celles, but was <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> healed by Germain, as is attested in the king's letters-patent bestowing the lands of Celles on the church of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in return for the favour he had received. In 588 St. Vincent's church was completed and dedicated by Germain, 23 December, the very day Childebert died. Close by the church a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was erected. Its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> had both spiritual and temporal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the suburbs of St. Germain till about the year 1670. The church was frequently plundered and set on fire by the Normans in the ninth century. It was rebuilt in 1014 and dedicated in 1163 by <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Pope Alexander III</a>. Childebert was succeeded by Clotaire, whose reign was short. At his death (561) the monarchy was divided among his four sons, Charibert becoming King of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He was a vicious, worthless creature, and Germain was forced to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> him in 568 for his immorality. Charibert died in 570. As his brothers quarrelled over his possessions the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> encountered great difficulties. He laboured to establish peace, but with little success. Sigebert and Chilperic, instigated by their wives, Brunehaut and the <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> murderess Fredegunde, went to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and Chilperic being defeated, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> fell into Sigebert's hands. Germain wrote to Brunehaut (his letter is preserved) asking her to use her influence to prevent further <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Sigebert was obdurate. Despite Germain's warning he set out to attack Chilperic at <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, whither he had fled, but Fredegunde <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be assassinated on the way at Vitri in 575. Germain himself died the following year before peace was restored. His remains were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in St. Symphorien's <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">vestibule</a> of St. Vincent's church, but in 754 his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were solemnly removed into the body of the church, in the presence of Pepin and his son, <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, then a child of seven. From that time the church became known as that of St. Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s. In addition to the letter mentioned above we have a treatise on the ancient Gallican liturgy, attributed to Germain, which has been published by Martene in his &quot;Thesauruis Novus Anecdotorum&quot;. St. Germain's feast is kept on 28 May.
