<h1>St. Germaine Cousin</h1>  

<p>Born in 1579 of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> at Pibrac, a village about ten miles from <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>; died in her native place in 1601. From her birth she seemed marked out for suffering; she came into the world with a deformed hand and the disease of scrofula, and, while yet an infant, lost her mother. Her father soon married again, but his second wife treated Germaine with much cruelty. Under pretence of saving the other children from the contagion of scrofula she persuaded the father to keep Germaine away from the homestead, and thus the child was employed almost from infancy as a shepherdess. When she returned at night, her bed was in the stable or on a litter of vine branches in a garret. In this hard <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> Germaine learned early to practise <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and patience. She was gifted with a marvellous sense of the <a href="../cathen/12396a.htm">presence of God</a> and of spiritual things, so that her lonely life became to her a source of light and blessing. To poverty, bodily infirmity, the rigours of the seasons, the lack of affection from those in her own home, she added <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortifications</a> and austerities, making bread and water her daily food. Her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament</a> and for His Virgin Mother presaged the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. She assisted daily at the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>; when the bell rang, she fixed her sheep-hook or distaff in the ground, and left her flocks to the care of Providence while she heard Mass. Although the pasture was on the border of a forest infested with wolves, no harm ever came to her flocks.

<p>She is said to have practised many austerities as a reparation for the sacrileges perpetrated by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in the neighbouring churches. She frequented the Sacraments of Penance and the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, and it was observed that her <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> increased on the approach of every feast of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> was her only book, and her devotion to the Angelus was so great that she used to fall on her knees at the first sound of the bell, even though she heard it when crossing a stream. Whenever she could do so, she assembled the children of the village around her and sought to instil into their minds the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and Mary. The villagers were inclined at first to treat her <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> with mild derision, until certain signs of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> signal favour made her an object of reverence and awe. In repairing to the village church she had to cross a stream. The ford in winter, after heavy rains or the melting of snow, was at times impassable. On several occasions the swollen waters were seen to open and afford her a passage without wetting her garments. Notwithstanding her poverty she found means to help the poor by sharing with them her allowance of bread. Her father at last came to a sense of his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, forbade her stepmother henceforth to treat her harshly, and wished to give her a place in the home with the other children, but she begged to be allowed to remain in the humbler position. At this point, when men were beginning to realize the beauty of her life, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> called her to Himself. One morning in the early summer of 1601, her father finding that she had not risen at the usual hour went to call her; he found her dead on her pallet of vine-twigs. She was then twenty-two years of age.

<p>Her remains were buried in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of Pibrac in front of the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a>. In 1644, when the grave was opened to receive one of her relatives, the body of Germaine was discovered fresh and perfectly preserved, and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> raised almost to the level of the floor of the church. It was exposed for public view near the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a>, until a noble lady, the wife of Fran&ccedil;ois de Beauregard, presented as a thanks-offering a casket of lead to hold the remains. She had been cured of a malignant and incurable ulcer in the breast, and her infant son whose life was despaired of was restored to health on her seeking the intercession of Germaine. This was the first of a long series of wonderful cures wrought at her <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. The leaden casket was placed in the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>, and in 1661 and 1700 the remains were viewed and found fresh and intact by the vicars-general of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, who have left testamentary depositions of the fact. Expert medical evidence deposed that the body had not been embalmed, and experimental tests showed that the preservation was not due to any <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> inherent in the soil. In 1700 a movement was begun to procure the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> of Germaine, but it fell through owing to accidental causes. In 1793 the casket was <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecrated</a> by a <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">revolutionary</a> tinsmith, named Toulza, who with three accomplices took out the remains and buried them in the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>, throwing quick-lime and water on them. After the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, her body was found to be still intact save where the quick-lime had done its work.

<p>The private veneration of Germaine had continued from the original finding of the body in 1644, supported and encouraged by numerous cures and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. The cause of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> was resumed in 1850. The documents attested more than 400 <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> or extraordinary <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, and thirty postulatory letters from <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> besought the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> attested were cures of every kind (of blindness, congenital and resulting from disease, of hip and spinal disease), besides the multiplication of food for the distressed community of the Good Shepherd at <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a> in 1845. On 7 May, 1854, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> proclaimed her <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a>, and on 29 June, 1867, placed her on the canon of virgin <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept in the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> on 15 June. She is represented in art with a shepherd's crook or with a distaff; with a watchdog, or a sheep; or with flowers in her apron.
