<h1>St. Germanus I</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople (715-30), b. at Constantinople towards the end of the reign of Emperor Heraclius (610-41); d. there 733 or 740. The son of Justinianus, a patrician, Germanus dedicated himself to the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and became a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>. Some time after the death of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, who had filled various high official positions, at the hands of the nephew of Heraclius, Germanus was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a>, but the exact year of his elevation is not known. According to <a href="../cathen/14623a.htm">Theophanes</a> and Nicephorus, he was present in this capacity at the Synod of Constantinople held in 712 at the insistance of the new emperor, Philippicus, who favoured <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelitism</a>. The object of the council was to re-establish <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelitism</a> and to condemn the Acts of the <a href="../cathen/04310a.htm">Sixth General Council</a> of 681. Even Germanus is said to have bowed to the imperial will, with the majority of the Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, Conc. Coll., XII, 192-96). However, immediately after the dethronement of Emperor Philippicus (713) his successor, Anastasius II, restored <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelitism</a> was now definitively banished from the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>. If Germanus really yielded for a short time to the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> teachings of the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelites</a>, he now once more acknowledged the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> definition of the two wills in Christ. John, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, appointed by Philippicus to succeed the deposed Cyrus, sent to Pope Constantine a letter of submission and accepted the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> at the Council of 681, whereupon he was recognized by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople. On his death Germanus was raised to the patriarchal see (715), which he held until 730. Immediately (715 or 716) he convened at Constantinople a synod of Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who acknowledged and proclaimed anew the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the two wills and the two operations in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and placed under <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> Sergius, Cyrus, and the other leaders of <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelism</a>. Germanus entered into communication with the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, with a view to restoring them to unity with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but without success. Soon after his elevation to the patriarchal dignity the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclastic</a> storm burst forth in the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a>, Leo III the Isaurian, who was opposed to the veneration of images having just acceded to the imperial throne (716). Bishop Constantine of Nacoleia in Phrygia, who like some other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the empire condemned the veneration of the pictures and images of Christ and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, went to Constantinople, and entered into a discussion with Germanus on the subject. The patriarch represented the traditional use of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and sought to convince Constantine of the propriety of reverencing images. Apparently he was converted to the teaching of the patriarch, but he did not deliver the letter entrusted to him by Germanus for the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/14387a.htm">Synnada</a>, for which he was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. At the same time the learned patriarch wrote to Bishop Thomas of Claudiopolis, another <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclast</a>, and developed in detail the sound principles underlying the reverencing of images, as against the recent innovations. Emperor Leo III, however, did not recede from his position, and everywhere encouraged the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">iconoclasts</a>. In a volcanic eruption between the islands of <a href="../cathen/14629a.htm">Thera</a> and Therasia he saw a Divine judgment for the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> of image- worship, and in an edict (726) explained that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> images had taken the place of idols, and the venerators of images were <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolaters</a>, since, according to the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law of God</a> (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#vrs4">Exodus 20:4</a>), no product of the hand of man may be adored. Immediately afterwards, the first <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclastic</a> disturbances broke out in Constantinople. The Patriarch Germanus vigorously opposed the emperor, and sought to convert him to a truer view of things, whereupon Leo attempted to depose him. Germanus turned to <a href="../cathen/06787a.htm">Pope Gregory II</a> (729), who in a lengthy epistle praised his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and steadfastness. The emperor in 730 summoned the council before which Germanus was cited to subscribe to an imperial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> prohibiting images. He resolutely refused, and was thereupon compelled to resign his patriarchal office, being succeeded by the pliant Anastasius. Germanus withdrew to the home of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, where he died some years later at an advanced age. The Ecumenical Council of Nicaea (787) bestowed high praise on Germanus, who is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a saint in both the Greek and the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 12 May. Several writings of Germanus have been preserved (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G., XCVIII, 39-454), viz., "Narratio de sanctis synodis", a dialogue "De vitae termino", a letter to the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, and three letters on the reverencing of images, as well as nine discourses in the extravagant rhetorical style of the later <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a>. Of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> authenticity is the "Historia ecclesiastica et mystica", also attributed to him (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, loc. cit., 383-454).
