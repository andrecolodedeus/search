<h1>St. Gilbert of Sempringham</h1>  

<p>Founder of the <a href="../cathen/06556b.htm">Order of Gilbertines</a>, b. at Sempringham, on the border of the Lincolnshire fens, between Bourn and Heckington. The exact date of his birth is unknown, but it lies between 1083 and 1089; d. at Sempringham, 1189. His father, Jocelin, was a wealthy Norman <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a> holding lands in Lincolnshire; his mother, name unknown, was an Englishwoman of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> rank. Being ill-favoured and deformed, he was not destined for a military or knightly career, but was sent to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to study. After spending some time abroad, where he became a teacher, he returned as a young man to his Lincolnshire home, and was presented to the livings of Sempringham and Tirington, which were churches in his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> gift. Shortly afterwards he betook himself to the court of Robert Bloet, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lincoln, where he became a clerk in the episcopal household. Robert was succeeded in 1123 by Alexander, who retained Gilbert in his service ordaining him <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> much against his will. The revenues of Sempringham had to suffice for his maintenance in the court of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; those of Tirington he devoted to the poor. Offered the archdeaconry of Lincoln, he refused, saying that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no surer way to perdition. In 1131 he returned to Sempringham and, is father being dead, became lord of the manor and lands. It was in this year that he founded the Gilbertine Order, which he was the first is "Master", and constructed at Sempringham, with the help of Alexander, a dwelling and <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> for his <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, at the north of the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Andrew.

<p>His life henceforth became one of extraordinary austerity, its strictness not diminishing as he grew older, though the activity and fatigue caused by the government of the order were considerable. In 1147 he travelled to <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, in <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, where he met <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugene III</a>, St Bernard, and <a href="../cathen/09565a.htm">St. Malachy</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> expressed regret at not having known of him some years previously when choosing a successor to the deposed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>. In 1165 he was summoned before Henry II's justices at <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster</a> and was charged with having sent help to the exiled St. Thomas a Becket. To clear himself he was invited to take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> that he had not done so. He refused, for, though as a matter of fact he had not sent help, an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to that effect might make him appear an enemy to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. He was prepared for a sentence of exile, when letters came from the king in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, ordering the judges to await his return. In 1170, when Gilbert was already a very old man, some of his lay-brothers revolted and spread serious <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> against him. After some years of fierce controversy on the subject, in which Henry II took his part, <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> freed him from suspicion, and confirmed the privileges granted to the order. Advancing age induced Gilbert to give up the government of his order. He appointed as his successor Roger, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Malton. Very infirm and almost blind, he now made his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>, for though he had founded an order and ruled it for many years he had never become a religious in the strict sense. Twelve years after his death, at the earnest request of <a href="../cathen/07508c.htm">Hubert Walter</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were solemnly translated to an honourable place in the church at Sempringham, his shrine becoming a centre of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>. Besides the compilation of his rule, he has left in little treatise entitled "De constructione monasteriorum". His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept in the Roman calendar on 11 February.
