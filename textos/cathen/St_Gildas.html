<h1>St. Gildas</h1>  

<p>Surnamed the Wise; b. about 516; d. at Houat, Brittany, 570. Sometimes he is called "Badonicus" because, as he tells us, his birth took place the year the Britons gained a famous victory over the Saxons at Mount Badon, near Bath, Somersetshire (493 or 516). The biographies of Gildas exist &#151; one written by an unknown Breton <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the Abbey of Rhuys in the eleventh century, the other by Caradoc, a Welshman in the twelfth century. Both biographies contain unchronological and misleading statements, which have led some critics to reject the lives as altogether valueless. Ussher, Ware, Bale, Pits, and <a href="../cathen/04099c.htm">Colgan</a> endeavour to adjust the discrepancies by contending that there were at least two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> named Gildas, hence their invention of such distinctive surnames as "Albanicus", "Badonicus", "Hibernicus", "Historicus", etc. The more general opinion, however, adopted by <a href="../cathen/16051a.htm">Lanigan</a>, Leland, Healy, Stingfleet, Mabilon, Bollandus, and <a href="../cathen/11224d.htm">O'Hanlon</a>, is that there was but one St. Gildas. The discrepancies may be accounted for by the fact that the lives were drawn up in separate countries, and several centuries after the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> existed. As to Caradoc's statement that Gildas died at <a href="../cathen/06579a.htm">Glastonbury</a>, <a href="../cathen/11224d.htm">O'Hanlon</a> remarks that Glastonbury appropriated more <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> than Gildas (Lives of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Saints, I, 493).

<p>Both narratives agree in several striking details, and may thus be harmonized: Gildas was born in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> on the banks of the Clyde (possibly at Dumbarton), of a noble British <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. His father's name was Cau or Nau; his brother's, Huel or Cuil. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> under St. Iltut, and was a companion of <a href="../cathen/13422c.htm">St. Samson</a> and St. Peter of L&eacute;on. Having embraced the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> state, he passed over to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, where he was advanced to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. He is said to have lived some time in <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, and then to have crossed to North Britain, his teaching there being confirmed by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. On his return to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, at the invitation of King Ainmire, he strengthened the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of many, and built <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and churches. The <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalists</a> associate him with David and Cadoc in giving a special liturgy or Mass to the second order of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. He is said to have made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On the homeward journey his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of solitude <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to retire to the Isle of Houat, off Brittany, where he lived a life of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, study and austerity. His place of retreat having become known, the Bretons induced him to establish a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Rhuys on the mainland whither multitudes flocked (Marius Sepet, "St. Gildasde Rhuys", Paris, s.d.). It was at Rhuys he wrote his famous epistle to the British kings. His <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> there till the tenth century, when they were carried for safety into Berry. In the eighteenth century they were said to be preserved in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/15271b.htm">Vannes</a>. He is the patron of several churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in Brittany and elsewhere. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is locally observed on 29 January; another feast, 11 May, commemorates the translation of his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>.

<p>The authentic work of St. Gildas, "De excidio Britannae liber querulus", is now usually divided into three parts: (1) The preface; (2) A sketch of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> history from the Roman invasion to his own time; (3) An epistle of severe invective addressed to five petty British kings &#151; Constantine, Vortipor, Cyneglas, Cynan, and Maelgwn. In the same epistle he addresses and rebukes the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> whom he accuses of <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">sloth</a> and <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>. His writings are clearly the work of a man of no ordinary culture and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, and indicate that the author was thoroughly acquainted with the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>.

<p>Gildas is regarded as the earliest British historian and is quoted by <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> and <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>. Two <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> copies of his writings are preserved in <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge University</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>.
