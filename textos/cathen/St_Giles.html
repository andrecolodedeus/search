<h1>St. Giles</h1>  

<p>(Latin &AElig;gidius.)

<p>An Abbot, said to have been born of illustrious Athenian parentage about the middle of the seventh century. Early in life he devoted himself exclusively to spiritual things, but, finding his noble birth and high repute for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> in his native land an obstacle to his perfection, he passed over to <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, where he established himself first in a wilderness near the mouth of the Rhone and later by the River Gard. But here again the fame of his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> drew multitudes to him, so he withdrew to a dense forest near <a href="../cathen/11083a.htm">N&icirc;mes</a>, where in the greatest solitude he spent many years, his sole companion being a hind. This last retreat was finally discovered by the king's hunters, who had pursued the hind to its place of refuge. The king [who according to the legend was Wamba (or Flavius?), King of the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a>, but who must have been a <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frank</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> had expelled the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a> from the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/11083a.htm">N&icirc;mes</a> almost a century and a half earlier] conceived a high esteem for solitary, and would have heaped every <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> upon him; but the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> against all <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>. He consented, however, to receive thenceforth some disciples, and built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in his valley, which he placed under the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">rule of St. Benedict</a>. Here he died in the early part of the eighth century, with the highest repute for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.

<p>His cult spread rapidly far and wide throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, as is witnessed by the numberless churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> dedicated to him in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and the British Isles; by the numerous <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in prose and verse commemorating his virtues and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; and especially by the vast concourse of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> who from all <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> flocked to his shrine. In 1562 the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> were secretly transferred to <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> to save them from the hideous excesses of the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> who were then ravaging <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> in consequence declined. With the restoration of a great part of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> to the church of St. Giles in 1862, and the discovery of his former <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> there in 1865, the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> have recommenced. Besides the city of St-Gilles, which sprang up around the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, nineteen other cities bear his name, St-Gilles, <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, and a multitude of French cities, <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, Bridges, and Tournai in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a> and Bamberg, in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a> and Gran in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Bologna in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, possess celebrated <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Giles. In <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> art he is a frequent subject, being always depicted with his symbol, the hind. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 1 September. On this day there are also commemorated another St. Giles, an <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> of the tenth century (Acta SS., XLI, 305), and a Blessed Giles, d. about 1203, a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of Castaneda in the <a href="../cathen/02018d.htm">Diocese of Astorga</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (op. cit. XLI, 308).
