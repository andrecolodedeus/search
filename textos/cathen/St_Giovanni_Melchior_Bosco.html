<h1>St. Giovanni Melchior Bosco</h1>  

<p>(<em>Or</em> St. John Bosco; Don Bosco.)

<p>Founder of the <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesian Society</a>. Born of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poor</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> in a little cabin at Becchi, a hill-side hamlet near Castelnuovo, <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 16 August, 1815; died 31 January 1888; declared Venerable by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, 21 July, 1907. <span class="stiki"><em>Note:</em> Pope Pius XI <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> him in 1929 and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> him in 1934.</span>

<p>When he was little more than two years old his father died, leaving the support of three boys to the mother, Margaret Bosco. John's early years were spent as a shepherd and he received his first <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">instruction</a> at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He possessed a ready wit, a retentive <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, and as years passed his <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> for study grew stronger. Owing to the <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> of the home, however, he was often obliged to turn from his books to the field, but the desire of what he had to give up never left him. In 1835 he entered the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Chieri and after six years of study was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on the eve of <a href="../cathen/15058a.htm">Trinity Sunday</a> by Archbishop Franzoni of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>.

<p>Leaving the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, Don Bosco went to <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> where he entered <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> upon his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> labours. It was here that an incident occurred which opened up to him the real field of effort of his afterlife. One of his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> was to accompany Don Cafasso upon his visits to the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a> of the city, and the condition of the children confined in these places, abandoned to the most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> influences, and with little before them but the gallows, made such a indelible impression upon his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> that he resolved to devote his life to the rescue of these unfortunate outcasts. On the eighth of December, 1841, the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07674d.htm">Immaculate Conception</a>, while Don Bosco was vesting for <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13322a.htm">sacristan</a> drove from the Church a ragged urchin because he refused to serve <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>. Don Bosco heard his cries and recalled him, and in the friendship which sprang up between the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and Bartolomeo Garelli was sown the first seed of the "Oratory", so called, no doubt, after the <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">example</a> of <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a> and because <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was its prominent feature. Don Bosco entered eagerly upon the task of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">instructing</a> this first pupil of the streets; companions soon joined Bartolomeo, all drawn by a kindness they had never known, and in February, 1842, the Oratory numbered twenty boys, in March of the same year, thirty, and in March, 1846, four hundred.

<p>As the number of boys increased, the question of a suitable meeting-place presented itself. In good weather walks were taken on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and holidays to spots in the country about <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> where lunch was eaten, and realizing the charm which <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">music</a> held for the untamed spirits of his disciples Don Bosco organized a band for which some old brass instruments were procured. In the autumn of 1844 he was appointed assistant <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the <em>Rifugio</em>, where Don Borel entered enthusiastically into his work. With the approval of Archbishop Franzoni, two rooms were secured adjoining the <em>Rifugio</em> and converted into a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, which was <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a>. The members of the Oratory now gathered at the <em>Rifugio</em>, and numbers of boys from the surrounding district applied for admission. It was about this time (1845) that Don Bosco began his night <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and with the closing of the factories the boys flocked to his rooms where he and Don Borel instructed them in rudimentary branches.

<p>The success of the Oratory at the <em>Rifugio</em> was not of long duration. To his great distress Don Bosco was obliged to give up his rooms and from this on he was subjected to petty annoyances and obstacles which, at times, seemed to spell the ruin of his undertaking. His perseverance in the face of all difficulties led many to the conclusion that he was <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">insane</a>, and an attempt was even made to confine him in an <a href="../cathen/08038b.htm">asylum</a>. Complaints were lodged against him, declaring his community to be a nuisance, owing to the character of the boys he befriended. From the <em>Rifugio</em> the Oratory was moved to St. Martin's, to St. Peter's Churchyard, to three rooms in Via Cottolengo, where the night <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were resumed, to an open field, and finally to a rough shed upon the site of which grew up an Oratory that counted seven hundred members. Don Bosco took lodgings nearby, where he was joined by his mother. "Mama Margaret", as Don Bosco's mother came to be known, gave the last ten years of her life in devoted service to the little inmates of this first <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesian</a> home. When she joined her son at the Oratory the outlook was not bright. But sacrificing what small means she had, even to parting with her home, its furnishings, and her jewelry, she brought all the solicitude and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of a mother to these children of the streets. The evening classes increased and gradually dormitories were provided for many who desired to live at the Oratory. Thus was founded the first <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesian</a> Home which now houses about one thousand boys.

<p>The municipal authorities by this time had come to recognize the importance of the work which Don Bosco was doing, and he began with much success a fund for the erection of technical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and workshops. These were all completed without serious difficulty. In 1868 to meet the needs of the Valdocco quarter of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, Don Bosco resolved to build a church. Accordingly a plan was drawn in the form of a <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a> covering an area of 1,500 sq. yards. He experienced considerable difficulty in raising the necessary money, but the <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charity</a> of some friends finally enabled him to complete it at a cost of more than a million francs (about 200,000). The church was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 9 June, 1868, and placed under the <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">patronage</a> of <a href="../cathen/11360c.htm">Our Lady, Help of Christians</a>. In the same year in which Don Bosco began the erection of the church fifty <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and teachers who had been assisting him formed a society under a common rule which <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, provisionally in 1869, and finally in 1874, approved.
<h2>Character and growth of the oratory</h2>

<p>Any attempt to explain the popularity of the Oratory among the classes to which Don Bosco devoted his life would fail without an appreciation of his spirit which was its life. For his earliest intercourse with <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poor</a> boys he had never failed to see under the dirt, the rags, and the uncouthness the spark which a little kindness and encouragement would fan into a flame. In his <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> or <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> which he is said to have had in his early boyhood, wherein it was <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">disclosed</a> to him what his life work would be, a voice said to him: "Not with blows, but with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and gentleness must you draw these friends to the path of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." And whether this be accounted as nothing more than a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>, that was in reality the spirit with which he animated his Oratory. In the earlier days when the number of his little disciples was slender he drew them about him by means of small presents and attractions, and by pleasant walks to favorite spots in the environs of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>. These excursions occurring on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a>, Don Bosco would say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in the village church and give a short instruction on the <a href="../cathen/06659a.htm">Gospel</a>; breakfast would then be eaten, followed by games; and in the afternoon <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> would be <a href="../cathen/12144a.htm">chanted</a>, a lesson in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catechism</a> given, and the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> recited. It was a familiar sight to see him in the field surrounded by <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">kneeling</a> boys preparing for <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confession</a>.

<p>Don Bosco's method of study knew nothing of punishment. Observance of rules was obtained by instilling a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, by removing assiduously all occasions for disobedience, and by allowing no effort towards <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, how trivial soever it might be, to pass unappreciated. He held that the teacher should be father, adviser, and friend, and he was the first to adopt the preventive method. Of punishment he said: "As far as possible avoid punishing . . . . try to gain <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> before inspiring fear." And in 1887 he wrote: "I do not remember to have used formal punishment; and with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">God's grace</a> I have always obtained, and from apparently hopeless children, not alone what <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> exacted, but what my wish simply expressed." In one of his books he has discussed the causes of weakness of <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>, and derives them largely from a misdirected kindness in the rearing of children. <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">Parents</a> make a parade of precocious talents: the child understands quickly, and his sensitiveness enraptures all who meet him, but the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> have only succeeded in producing an affectionate, perfected, intelligent animal. The chief object should be to form the will and to temper the <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>. In all his pupils Don Bosco tried to cultivate a taste for <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">music</a>, believing it to be a powerful and refining influence. "Instruction", he said, "is but an accessory, like a game; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> never makes a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> because it does not directly touch the heart. It gives more power in the exercise of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but alone it is an indifferent weapon, wanting guidance." He always studied, too, the aptitudes and vocations of his pupils, and to an almost <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> quickness and clearness of insight into the hearts of children must be ascribed no small part of his success. In his rules he wrote: "Frequent <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Confession</a>, <a href="../cathen/06278a.htm">frequent Communion</a>, daily <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>: these are the pillars which should sustain the whole edifice of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>." Don Bosco was an indefatigable confessor, devoting days to the work among his children. He recognized that gentleness and persuasion alone were not enough to bring to the task of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. He thoroughly believed in play as a means of arousing childish curiosity &#151; more than this, he places it among his first recommendations, and for the rest he adopted <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri's</a> words: "Do as you wish, I do not care so long as you do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>."
<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>At the time of Don Bosco's death in 1888 there were 250 houses of the <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesian Society</a> in all parts of the world, containing 130,000 children, and from which there annually went out 18,000 finished apprentices. In the motherhouse Don Bosco had selected the brightest of his pupils, taught them <a href="../cathen/08245a.htm">Italian</a>, <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>, <a href="../cathen/06190a.htm">French</a>, and mathematics, and this band formed a teaching corps for the new homes which quickly grew up in other places. Up to 1888 over six thousand <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had gone forth from Don Bosco's institutions, 1,200 of whom had remained in the society. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> begin with the child in his first <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">instruction</a> and lead, for those who choose it, to <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. The society also conducts <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, evening <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for adult workmen, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for those who enter the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> late in life, technical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and printing establishments for the diffusion of good reading in different languages. Its members also have charge of <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and <a href="../cathen/08038b.htm">asylums</a>, nurse the sick, and do <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> work, especially in rural districts. The society has houses in the following countries: <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, Palestine, and <a href="../cathen/01311a.htm">Algiers</a>; in Central America, <a href="../cathen/10250b.htm">Mexico</a>, in South America, <a href="../cathen/11540a.htm">Patagonia</a>, Terra del Fuego, <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a>, <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, <a href="../cathen/11470b.htm">Paraguay</a>, <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">The Argentine Republic</a>, <a href="../cathen/02627a.htm">Bolivia</a>, <a href="../cathen/15230c.htm">Uruguay</a>, <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>, <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, <a href="../cathen/15327a.htm">Venezuela</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04121b.htm">Colombia</a>.
