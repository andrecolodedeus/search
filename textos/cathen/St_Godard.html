<h1>St. Godard</h1>  

<p>(Also spelled GOTHARD, GODEHARD).

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a> in Lower Saxony; born about the year 960, in a village of Upper <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, near the Abbey of Altaich, in the <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Diocese of Passau</a>; Nassau; died on 4 May, 1038 <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> in 1131.

<p>After a lengthy course of studies he received the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> habit in 991. Having entered the Abbey of Altaich, his learning and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> speedily procured his elevation to the dignity of prior, and afterwards that of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, in the discharge of which sacred <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> Godard went far towards enforcing rigorous observance of rule among those placed under his care. His special fitness in this department led to his being chosen to effect the work of reform in the Abbeys of Hersfeld, in <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>; Tegernsee, in the Diocese of Freising; and Kremsm&uuml;nster, in the <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Diocese of Passau</a>.

<p>On the death of <a href="../cathen/02513a.htm">St. Bernard</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a> (1021), Godard was chosen to succeed him; but his modesty yielded only to the urgent admonitions of <a href="../cathen/07227a.htm">Emperor St. Henry II</a>. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> kept up the high tradition of Godard's <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloistered</a> activity. The monastic observance was established, as far as possible, in his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. He built <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth in which he always manifested an active interest; maintained a rigorous personal surveillance over his <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; and fostered a strict observance of the liturgy whilst attending to the building and upkeep of churches. He also exercised a paternal care for the material needs of his people. Many churches in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> Godard as patron and several bear his name. His letters which have come down to us exhibit a lofty spiritual tone throughout. Godard was buried in his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>.

<p>In 1132, the year following his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> and the translation of his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, the erection of a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> under the patronage of St. Godard, was begun, and two altars were dedicated to him in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>.
