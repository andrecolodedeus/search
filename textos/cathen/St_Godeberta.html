<h1>St. Godeberta</h1>  

<p>Born about the year 640, at Boves, a few leagues from <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; died about the beginning of the eighth century, at Noyon (Oise), the ancient Noviomagus. She was very carefully <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>, her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> being of noble rank and attached to the court of King Clovis II. When the question of her marriage was being discussed in presence of the king, the saintly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Noyon, Eligius, as if by inspiration, presented Godeberta with a golden ring and expressed the hope that she might devote her life to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Godeberta, moved by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and feeling her heart suddenly filled with Divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, turned away from the bright prospects before her and refused the advantageous offers that had been made by her noble suitors. She declared her willingness to be the spouse of Christ and asked the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> to allow her to assume the veil. In a short time all opposition to her wishes disappeared and she entered on her new life under the guidance of <a href="../cathen/05386a.htm">St. Eligius</a>. The King of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> was impressed by her conduct and her <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> that he made her a present of the small palace which he had at Noyon, together with a little <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06453a.htm">St. George</a>. Godeberta's example inspired a number of young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to follow in the same path, and she founded in her new home a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, of which she became the superioress. Here she passed the remainder of her life in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and solitude, save when the call of charity or religion brought her forth among the people, many of whom were still sunk in the vices of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>. She was remarkable in particular for the constant penances and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> to which she subjected herself. She had a wonderful <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the efficacy of that ancient practice of the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>--the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>, and it is recorded, that on one occasion, in 676, during the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a> of St. Mommelinus, when the town was threatened with total destruction by fire, she made the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> over the flames, and the conflagration was forthwith extinguished. The exact year of her death is unknown, but it is said to have occurred on 11 June, on which day her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is marked in the Proprium of <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Beauvais</a>. In Noyon, however, by virtue of an <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 2 April, 1857, it is kept on the fifth Sunday after <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. The body of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. George, which was afterwards called by her name.

<p>In 1168 Godeberta's body was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> translated from the ruined church where it had rested for over 450 years by Bishop Baudoin to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Noyon. Providentially her <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> have escaped the ravages of time and fire, and the malice of the irreligious. At the period of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> townsman secretly buried them near the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. When the storm had passed they were recovered from their hiding place and their authenticity being canonically established they were replaced in the church. A bell is still preserved which tradition avers to have been the one actually used by Godeberta in her <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. It is certainly very ancient and there seems no good reason, in particular from an archaeological point of view, for doubting the trustworthiness of the legend. In the treasury of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> likewise may be seen a gold ring, said to have been that presented by <a href="../cathen/05386a.htm">St. Eligius</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. Mention is made in a record of the year 1167 of this <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> having been then in the possession of the church of Noyon.

<p>Unfortunately the most ancient documents we have giving details of Godeberta's life do not, in all probability, date back beyond the eleventh century, as the oldest "Vita", which, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is rather a panegyric for her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> than a biography, is believed to have been composed by Radbodus, who became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Noyon in 1067. In those days, too, the aim of such writers was the edification rather than the instruction of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, so we find in this life the usual wonders related in such <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> works of that period with but few historic facts. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, however, that St. Godeberta was looked upon as a protector in the time of plagues and catastrophes and we have every reason to hold that this practice was justified by the results that followed her solemn invocation. In 1866 a violent outbreak of typhoid fever occurred in Noyon, decimating the town. On 23 May in that year, one of the leading citizens, whose child had just been stricken down, approached the cure of the church and recalling the favours that had been granted in ages past to the clients of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, earnestly asked that the shrine containing her <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> should be exposed and a novena of intercession begun. This was done the following day, and forthwith the scourge ceased; it was officially certified that not another case of typhoid occurred. In thanksgiving a solemn procession took place under the guidance of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Mgr Gignoux, a few weeks later, the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Godeberta being carried triumphantly through the town. A beautiful <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Noyon, which was blessed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on 25 February, 1867, perpetuated the memory of this wonderful event.
