<h1>St. Godelina</h1>  

<p>(GODELINA.)

<p>Born at Hondeforte-lez-Boulogne, c. 1049; died at Ghistelles, 6 July, 1070. The youngest of the three children born to Hemfrid, seigneur of Wierre-Effroy, and his wife Ogina, Godelina was accustomed as a child to exercises of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and was soon distinguished for a solidity of virtue extraordinary for one of her years. The poor flocked from all sides to the young girl, whose desires to satisfy their necessities often involved her in difficulties with her father's steward and even with her <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> father himself. By her eighteenth year the fame of her beauty and admirable qualities had spread far and wide through Artois and even into <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, and many suitors presented themselves; but, the decision being left with Godelina, she persisted in the resolution she had made of renouncing the world for the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. One of the young noblemen, Bertolf of Ghistelles, determined to leave nothing undone, invoked the influence of her father's suzerain, Eustache II, Count of Boulogne, whose representations proved successful. After the wedding Bertolf and his bride set out for Ghistelles, where, however, Godelina found a bitter and unrelenting enemy in Bertolf's mother, who induced her son to forsake his wife on the very day of their arrival, and immured Godelina in a narrow cell, with barely enough nourishment to support life. Even this, however, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> contrived to share with the poor. Under the influence of his mother, Bertolf spread abroad foul <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> about his bride. After some time Godelina managed to escape to the home of her father, who roused the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a> and the Count of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> to threaten Bertolf with the terrors of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. Seemingly repentant, he promised to restore his wife to her rightful position, but her return to Ghistelles was the signal for a renewal of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> in an aggravated form. After about a year Bertolf, again feigning sorrow, easily effected a reconciliation, but only to avoid the suspicion of the crime he was mediating. During his absence two of his servants at his direction strangled Godelina causing it to appear that she had died a natural death. Bertolf soon contracted a second marriage, but the daughter born to him was blind from birth. Her <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> recovery of sight through the intercession of St. Godelina so affected her father that, now truly converted he journeyed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to obtain <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> for his crime, undertook a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the Holy Land, and finally entered the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St-Winoc at Bergues, where he expiated his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by a life of severe <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">penance</a>. At his desire his daughter erected at Ghistelles a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> dedicated to St. Godelina, which she entered as a religious. Devotion to St. Godelina dates from 1084, when her body was exhumed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a> and Noyon, and her <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, recognized at various times by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, are to be found in various cities of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>.
