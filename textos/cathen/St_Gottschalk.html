<h1>St. Gottschalk</h1>  

<p>(GODESCALCUS).

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a> Prince of the Wends; d. at Lenzen on the Elbe, 7 June 1066. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is noted for 7 June in the additions of the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> of Usuardus. He was the son of Udo, Prince of the Abrodites who remained a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, though a poor one ("male christianus", says <a href="../cathen/01132c.htm">Adam of Bremen</a>, Mon. Germ. SS., VII, 329), after his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> Mistiwoi had renounced the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. He was sent to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Michael at Lenzen for his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Udo, for some act of cruelty, was slain by a Saxon. At the news Gottschalk cast aside all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> principles thinking only of revenge, he escaped from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, crossed the Elbe, and gathered an army from his own and the other <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> tribes who then lived on the northern and eastern boundaries of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. It is said that thousands of Saxons were slaughtered before they were aware of the approach of an army. But his forces were not able to withstand those of Duke Bernard II. Gottschalk was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> and his lands were given to Ratibor. After some years he was released, and went to <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> with many of his people. Canute of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> employed them in his <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> in <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, and afterwards sent them to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> with his new Sweyn. In these expeditions Gottschalk was very successful. He had now returned to practice of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and married Sigrith, a daughter, some say, Canute, others of King Magnus of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>. After the death of Ratibor and his sons he returned to his home, and by his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> regained his princely position. <a href="../cathen/01132c.htm">Adam of Bremen</a> calls him a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and god-fearing man. But he was more; he was an organizer and an apostle. His object in life seems to have been to collect the scattered tribes of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> into one kingdom, and to make that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. In the former he succeeded well. To effect the latter purpose he obtained <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. He would accompany the missionaries from place to place and would inculcate their words by his own explanations and instructions. He established <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at <a href="../cathen/11237b.htm">Oldenburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/10107a.htm">Mecklenburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/16070a.htm">Ratzeburg</a>, Lubeck, and Lenzen; the first three he had erected into <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. He also contributed most generously to the building of churches and the support of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In all this he was ably seconded by Adalbert, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, and numerous conversions were the result of their efforts. But a reaction set in. Some of the tribes refused to adopt <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianty</a>, and rose in rebellion; Gottschalk and many of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> fell victims to the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.
