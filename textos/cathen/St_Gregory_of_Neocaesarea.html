<div id="springfield2">
<h1>St. Gregory of Neocaesarea</h1>  

<p>Known at THAUMATURGUS, (<em>ho Thaumatourgos</em>, the miracle-worker).

<p>Born at Neoc&aelig;sarea in <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> (<a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>) about 213; died there 270-275. Among those who built up the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>, extended its influence, and strengthened its institutions, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> occupy a high position; among them Gregory of Neocaesarea holds a very prominent place. His pastoral work is but little known, and his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> writings have reached us in a very incomplete state. In this semi-obscurity the <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> of this great man seems eclipsed and dwarfed; even his immemorial title <em>Thaumaturgus</em> (the wonder-worker) casts an air of legend about him. Nevertheless, the lives of few <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the third century are so well authenticated; the historical references to him permit us to reconstruct his work with considerable detail.

<p>Originally he was known as Theodore (the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift of God</a>), not an exclusively <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">Christian name</a>. Moreover, his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>, and he was unacquainted with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> till after the death of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, at which time he was fourteen years old. He had a brother Athenodorus, and, on the advice of one of their tutors, the young men were anxious to study <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at the law-school of <a href="../cathen/02392a.htm">Beirut</a>, then one of the four of five famous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the Hellenic world. At this time, also, their brother-in-law was appointed assessor to the Roman Governor of Palestine; the youths had therefore an occasion to act as an escort to their sister as far as Caesarea in Palestine. On arrival in that town they learned that the celebrated scholar <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, head of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, resided there. Curiosity led them to hear and converse with the master, and his irresistible charm did the rest. Soon both youths forgot all about Beirut and <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, and gave themselves up to the great <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> teacher, who gradually won them over to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. In his panegyric on <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, Gregory describes the method employed by that master to win the confidence and esteem of those he wished to convert; how he mingled a persuasive candour with outbursts of temper and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> argument put cleverly at once and unexpectedly. Persuasive skill rather than bare reasoning, and evident sincerity and an ardent conviction were the means <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> used to make converts. Gregory took up at first the study of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> was afterwards added, but his mind remained always inclined to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> study, so much so indeed that in his youth he cherished strongly the hope of demonstrating that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> was the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and good philosophy. For seven years he underwent the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> and moral discipline of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (231 to 238 or 239). There is no reason to believe that is studies were interrupted by the persecutions of Maximinus of Thrace; his alleged journey to <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, at this time, may therefore be considered at least <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, and probably never occurred.

<p>In 238 or 239 the two brothers returned to their native <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>. Before leaving Palestine Gregory delivered in presence of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> a public farewell oration in which he returned thanks to the illustrious master he was leaving. This oration is valuable from many points of view. As a rhetorical exercise it exhibits the excellent training given by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, and his skill in developing literary taste; it exhibits also the amount of adulation then permissible towards a living <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in an assembly composed mostly of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> in temper. It contains, moreover, much useful information concerning the youth of Gregory and his master's method of teaching. A letter of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> refers to the departure of the two brothers, but it is not easy to determine whether it was written before or after the delivery of this oration. In it <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> exhorts (quite unnecessarily, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>) his pupils to bring the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> treasures of the Greeks to the service of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> philosophy, and thus imitate the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who employed the golden vessels of the Egyptians to adorn the Holy of Holies. It may be supposed that despite the original abandonment of <a href="../cathen/02392a.htm">Beirut</a> and the study of <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, Gregory had not entirely given up the original purpose of his journey to the Orient; as a matter of fact, he returned to <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> with the intention of practising law. His plan, however, was again laid aside, for he was soon <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of his native Caesarea by Phoedimus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Amasea and <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>. This fact illustrates in an interesting way the growth of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in the primitive Church, for we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community at Caesarea was very small, being only seventeen <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and it was given a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, moreover, from ancient canonical documents, that it was possible for a community of even ten <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to have their own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. When Gregory was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> he was forty years old, and he ruled his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> for thirty years. Although we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing definite as to his methods, we cannot <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he must have shown much <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in increasing the little flock with which he began his episcopal administration. From an ancient source we learn a fact that is at once a curious coincidence, and throws light on his missionary <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>; whereas he began with only seventeen <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, at his death there remained but seventeen <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> in the whole town of Caesarea. The many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which won for his the title of <em>Thaumaturgus</em> were doubtless performed during these years. The Oriental mind revels so naturally in the marvellous that a serious historian cannot accept unconditionally all its product; yet if ever the title of "wonder-worker" was deserved, Gregory had a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to it.



<p>It is to be noted here that our sources of information as to the life, teaching, and actions of Gregory Thaumaturgus are all more or less open to criticism. Besides the details given us by Gregory himself, and of which we have already spoken, there are four other sources of information, all, according to K&ouml;tschau, derived from oral tradition; indeed, the differences between them force the conclusion that they cannot all be derived from one common written source. They are: <ul> <li><em>Life and Panegyric of Gregory</em> by <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a> (P.G., XLVI, col. 893 sqq.); <li><em>Historia Miraculorum</em>, by Russinus; <li>an account in Syriac of the great actions of Blessed Gregory (sixth century <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>); <li><a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, <em>De Spiritu Sancto</em>. </ul> <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> with the help of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> traditions and a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the neighbourhood, has left us an account of the <em>Thaumaturgus</em> that is certainly more historical than any other known to us. From Rufinus we see that in his day (c. 400) the original story was becoming confused; the Syriac account is at times obscure and contradictory. Even the life by <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> exhibits a legendary element, though its facts were all supplied to the writer by his grandmother, <a href="../cathen/09508b.htm">St. Macrina the Elder</a>. He relates that before his episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> Gregory retired from Neoc&aelig;sarea into a solitude, and was favoured by an apparition of the Blessed Virgin and the Apostle St. John, and that the latter dictated to him a creed or formula of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, of which the autograph existed at Neoc&aelig;sarea when the biography was being written. The creed itself is quite important for the history of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> (Caspari, <em>Alte und neue Quellen zur Gesch, d. Taufsymols und der Glaubernsregel</em>, Christiania, 1879, 1-64). <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> describes at length the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> that gained for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03133b.htm">Caesarea</a> the title of <em>Thaumaturgus</em>; herein the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginative</a> element is very active. It is clear, however, that Gregory's influence must have been considerable, and his <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">miraculous power</a> undoubted. It might have been expected that Gregory's name would appear among those who took part in the First Council of Antioch against <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a> (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.28</a>); probably he took part also in the second council held there against the same heresiarch, for the letter of that council is signed by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> named Theodore, which had been originally Gregory's name (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, op. cit., VII, xxx). To attract the people to the festivals in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, we learn that Gregory organized profane amusements as an attraction for the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> who could not understand a solemnity without some pleasures of a less serious nature than the religious <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>.
<h2>Writings of gregory</h2>

<p>The <em>Oratio Panegyrica</em> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> describes in detail that master's pedagogical methods. Its literary value consists less in its style than in its novelty, it being the first attempt at autobiography in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature. This youthful work is full of enthusiasm and genuine talent; moreover, it proves how fully <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> had won the admiration of his pupils, and how the training Gregory received influenced the remainder of a long and well spent life. Gregory tells us in this work (xiii) that under <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> he read the works of many <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, without restriction as to <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, except that of the <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheists</a>. From this reading of the old <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> he learned to insist frequently on the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and his long experience of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> or crudely <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> populations taught him how <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> this was. Traces of this insistence are to be met with in the <em>Tractatus ad Theopompum</em>, concerning the passibility and impassibility of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; this work seems to belong to Gregory, though in its general arrangement it reminds us of Methodius. A similar trait was probably characteristic of the lost <em>Dialogus cum Aeliano</em> (<em>Pros Ailianon dialexis</em>), which we learn of through St. Basil, who frequently attests the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of the Thaumaturgus (Ep. xxviii, 1, 2; cciv, 2; ccvii, 4) and even defends him against the Sabellians, who claimed him for their teaching and quoted as his formula: <em>patera kaiouion epinoia men einai duo, hypostasei de en</em> (that the Father and the Son were two in intelligence, but one in substance) from the aforesaid <em>Dialogus cum Aeliano</em>. St. Basil replied that Gregory was arguing against a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>, and used the words <em>agonistikos</em> not <em>dogmatikos</em>, i.e. in the heat of combat, not in calm exposition; in this case he was insisting, and rightly, on the Divine unity. he added, moreover, that a like explanation must be given to the words <em>ktisma, poiema</em> (created, made) when applied to the Son, reference being to Christ Incarnate. Basil added that the text of the work was corrupt.

<p>The "Epostola Canonica", <em>epistole kanonike</em> (Routh, <em>Reliquiae Sacrae</em>, III, 251-83) is valuable to both historian and canonist as evidence of the organization of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Caesarea and the other Churches of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> under Gregory's influence, at a time when the invading <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> had begun to aggravate a situation made difficult enough by the imperial persecutions. We learn from this work how absorbing the episcopal charge was for a man of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and a strict sense of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. Moreover it helps us to understand how a man so well equipped mentally, and with the literary gifts of Gregory, has not left a greater number of works.

<p>The <em>Ekthesis tes pisteos</em> (Exposition of the Faith) is in its kind a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> document not less precious than the foregoing. It makes clear Gregory's <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> apropos of the Trinity. Its authenticity and date seem now definitely settled, the date lying between 260-270. Caspari has shown that this confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a development of the premises laid down by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>. Its conclusion leaves no room for <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>: <blockquote> There is therefore nothing created, nothing greater or less (literally, nothing subject) in the Trinity (<em>oute oun ktiston ti, he doulon en te triadi</em>), nothing superadded, as though it had not existed before, but never been without the Son, nor the Son without the Spirit; and this same Trinity is immutable and unalterable forever. </blockquote>

<p>Such a formula, stating clearly the distinction between the Persons in the Trinity, and emphasizing the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, equality, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and perfection, not only of the Father, but of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, proclaims a marked advance on the theories of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>.

<p>A <em>Metaphrasis eis ton Ekklesiasten tou Solomontos</em>, or paraphrase of Ecclesiastes, is attributed to him by some <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>; others ascribe it to <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzus</a>; <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (<a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 65</a> and Com. in eccles., iv) ascribes it to our Gregory. The <em>Epistola ad Philagrium</em> has reached us in a Syriac version. It treats of the <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">Consubstantiality</a> of the Son and has also been attributed to <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzus</a> (Ep. ccxliii; formerly Orat. xiv); <a href="../cathen/14724b.htm">Tillemont</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, however, deny this because it offers no expression suggestive of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> controversy. Draeseke, nevertheless, calls attention to numerous views and expressions in this treatise that recall the writings of <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzus</a>. The brief <em>Treatise on the Soul</em> addressed to one <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, in favour of which may be cited the testimony of Nicholas of Methone (probably from Procupius of <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a>), is now claimed for Gregory.

<p>The <em>Kephalaia peri pisteos dodeka</em> or <em>Twelve Chapters on Faith</em> do not seem to be the work of Gregory. According to Caspari, the <em>Kata meros pistis</em> or brief exposition of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning the Trinity and the Incarnation, attributed to Gregory, was composed by Apollinaris of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> about 380, and circulated by his followers as a work of Gregory (Bardenhewer). Finally, the Greek, Syriac, and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <em>Caten&aelig;</em> contain fragments attributed more or less correctly to Gregory. The fragments of the <em>De Resurrectione</em> belong rather to <a href="../cathen/11436b.htm">Pamphilus</a> <em>Apologia</em> for <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>.
