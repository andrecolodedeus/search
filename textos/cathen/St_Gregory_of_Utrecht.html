<h1>St. Gregory of Utrecht</h1>  

<p>Abbot; b. about 707 or 708; d. 775 or 780. Gregory was born of a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. His father Alberic was the son of Addula, who, as <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, was <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Pfalzel (Palatiolum) near <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. On account of the similarity of names, and in consequence of a forged last will, Addula has been frequently confounded with Adala (Adela), daughter of Dagobert II of Austrasia--thus falsely making Gregory a scion of the royal house of the Merovingians. He received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at Pfalzel. When, in 722, <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> passed through <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> on his way from Frisia to Hessia and Thuringia, he rested at this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. Gregory was called upon to read the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a> at the meals. <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> gave an explanation and dwelt upon the merits of an apostolic life, in such warm and convincing terms that the heart of Gregory was filled with enthusiasm. He announced his intention of going with <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> and nothing could move him from his resolution. He now became the disciple and in time the helper of the great Apostle of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, sharing his hardships and labours, accompanying him in all his missionary tours, and learning from the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> the secret of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. In 738 <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> made his third journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; Gregory went with him and brought back many valuable additions for his <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. About 750 Gregory was made <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Martin's, in <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>. In 744 <a href="../cathen/15645a.htm">St. Willibrord</a>, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, had died but had received no successor. <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> had taken charge and had appointed an administrator. In 754 he started on his last missionary trip and took with him the administrator, St. Eoban, who was to share his crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. After this <a href="../cathen/14288c.htm">Pope Stephen II (III)</a> and Pepin ordered Gregory to look after the diocese. For this reason some (even the Mart. Rom.) call him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, though he never received episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, a kind of missionary <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, was now a centre of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and learning. Students flocked to it from all sides: <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, Frisians, Saxons, even Bavarians and Swabians. <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, though it had splendid <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of its own, sent scholars. Among his disciples St. Liudger is best known. He became the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Munster later, and wrote the life of Gregory. In it (Acta SS., Aug., V, 240) he extols the virtues of Gregory, his contempt of riches, his sobriety, his forgiving spirit and his almsdeeds. Some three years before Gregory's death, a lameness attacked his left side and gradually spread over his entire body. At the approach of death he had himself carried into church and there breathed his last. His <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were religiously kept at <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, and in 1421 and 1597 were examined at episcopal visitations. A large portion of his head is in the church of St. Amelberga at Sustern, where an official recognition took place 25 Sept., 1885, by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13110a.htm">Roermond</a> (Anal. Boll., V, 162). A letter written by St. Lullus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, to St. Gregory is still extant (P.L., XCVI, 821).
