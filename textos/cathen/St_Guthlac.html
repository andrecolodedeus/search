<h1>St. Guthlac</h1>  

<p>Hermit; born about 673; died at <a href="../cathen/04541a.htm">Croyland</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 11 April, 714. Our authority for the life of St. Guthlac is the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Felix (of what <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> is not known), who in his dedication of the "Life" to King &AElig;thelbald, Guthlac's friend, assures him that whatever he has written, he had derived immediately from old and intimate companions of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. Guthlac was born of noble stock, in the land of the Middle Angles. In his boyhood he showed extraordinary signs of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; after eight or nine years spent in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a>, during which he never quite forgot his early training, he became filled with remorse and determined to enter a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. This he did at Repton (in what is now Derbyshire). Here after two years of great penance and earnest application to all the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the monastic life, he became fired with enthusiasm to emulate the wonderful penance of the Fathers of the Desert. For this purpose he retired with two companions to <a href="../cathen/04541a.htm">Croyland</a>, a lonely island in the dismal fen- lands of modern Lincolnshire. In this solitude he spent fifteen years of the most rigid penance, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> daily until sundown and then taking only coarse bread and water. Like St. Anthony he was frequently attacked and severely maltreated by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a>, and on the other hand was the recipient of extraordinary <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> and powers. The birds and the fishes became his familiar friends, while the fame of his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> brought throngs of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> to his cell. One of them, Bishop Hedda (or Dorchester or of <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a>), raised him to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. &AElig;thelbald, nephew of the terrible Penda, spent part of his exile with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>.

<p>Guthlac, after his death, in a vision to &AElig;thelbald, revealed to him that he should one day become king. The prophecy was verified in 716. During <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a> of 714, Guthlac sickened and announced that he should die on the seventh day, which he did joyfully. The anniversary (11 April) has always been kept as his feast. Many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were wrought at his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, which soon became a centre of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>. His old friend, &AElig;thelbald, on becoming king, proved himself a generous benefactor. Soon a large <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> arose, and through the industry of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, the fens of <a href="../cathen/04541a.htm">Croyland</a> became one of the richest spots in England. The later history of his shrine may be found in <a href="../cathen/11278a.htm">Ordericus Vitalis</a> (Historia Ecclesiastica) and in the "History of Croyland" by the Pseudo-Ingulph. Felix's Latin "Life" was turned into Anglo-Saxon prose by some unknown hand. This version was first published by Goodwin in 1848. There is also a metrical version attributed to <a href="../cathen/04581d.htm">Cynewulf</a> contained in the celebrated Exeter Book (Codex Exoniensis).
