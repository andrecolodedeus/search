<h1>St. G&eacute;rard, Abbot of Brogne</h1>  

<p>Born at Staves in the county of <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a>, towards the end of the ninth century; died at Brogne or St-G&eacute;rard, 3 Oct. 959. The son of Stance, of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of dukes of Lower Austrasia, and of Plectrude, sister of Stephen, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, the young G&eacute;rard, like most omen of his rank, followed at first the career of arms. His <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, however, was admirable amid the distractions of camp. He transformed into a large church a modest <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> situated on the estate of Brogne which belonged to his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. About 917, the Count of <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a> charged him with a mission to Robert, younger brother of Eudes, King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He permitted his followers to reside at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, but himself went to live at the Abbey of St-Denis, where he was so struck by the deifying lives of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> that, at the conclusion of his embassy, with the consent of the Count of <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a> and Bishop Stephen, his maternal uncle, he returned to St-Denis, took the religious habit, and after eleven years was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He then requested to be allowed to return to Brogne, where he replaced the lax <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> with <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> animated by a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religious spirit. Thereupon he himself retired to a cell near the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for more austere <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>. From this retreat he was summoned by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> who confided to him the direction of the community of St-Ghislain in Hainault. Here also he established <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> instead of the canons, whose conduct had ceased to be exemplary, and he enforced the strictest monastic discipline. Gradually he became superior of eighteen other <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> situated in the region between the Meuse, the Somme, and the sea, and through his efforts the Order of St. Benedict was soon completely restored throughout this region. Weighed down by age and infirmities, he placed vicars or <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> in his stead, in the various <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> with which he was charged, and retired to that of Brogne. He still had <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to take a journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in order to obtain a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> confirming the privileges of that <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. On his return he paid a final visit to all the communities which he had reorganized, and then awaited death at Brogne. His body is still preserved at Brogne, now commonly called St-G&eacute;rard.
