<h1>St. G&eacute;ry</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>Gaugericus</em>).

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>-Arras; b. of Roman <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, Gaudentius and Austadiola, at Eposium (Yvois, Carignan), <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, about the middle of the sixth century; d. 11 August, between 623 and 626. The Diocese of Cambrai-Arras is of recent date compared with the more ancient see of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, Tongres, which dates from the fourth century. The territory, which comprised the Diocese of Cambrai-Arras, like that of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a> and T&eacute;rouanne, probably contained <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> before the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the appearance of its first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, St. Vaast, but their spiritual head must have resided at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. The great barbarian invasion of 406 completely overthrew the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization, but from the beginning of the Merovingian period the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> began to recover, the <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Diocese of Arras</a> especially being restored by St. Vaast about the beginning of the sixth century. G&eacute;ry was one of his earliest successors. From his youth G&eacute;ry led a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and devout life, and already all things combined to prepare him for the career of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and devotion which he was to embrace later on. During one of his episcopal visitations, St. Magneric, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, was struck by the exemplary conduct of the young man and conceived the project of enrolling him in the ranks of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. G&eacute;ry was not <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, say his biographers, until he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the whole <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> by heart. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> of Cambrai-Arras soon became <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a>, and G&eacute;ry was called to fill it. King Childebert II gave his consent and instructed &AElig;gidius <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. This installation must have taken place between 585 and 587. Filled with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a>, G&eacute;ry devoted his life to the extermination of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> which infected the district subject to his authority, and, since the worship of the old gods was deeply rooted in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the barbarous peoples, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> destroyed or purchased the idols, which were the objects of their veneration. He erected the church of St-M&eacute;dard in the chief town of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>. He frequently visited the rural districts and the <em>villae</em> at a distance from his episcopal city, displaying particular solicitude for the ransom of captives.

<p>But political events soon introduced a new dominion, when Clotaire II (d. 629) took possession of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> went to pay his respects to the conqueror in his villa of Chelles, probably in 613. At the command of the king he was compelled to go to the sanctuary and national place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>, there to distribute <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to the poor. In October, 614, G&eacute;ry assisted at the Council of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He died after an episcopate of thirty-nine years, and was buried in the church of St-M&eacute;dard at <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>. G&eacute;ry was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> with a cult immediately after his death. In the time of his successor Bertoald his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> was already the object of fervent veneration, and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St-M&eacute;dard which he had founded profited largely by the offerings made to him. Mention of his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is already made in the additions to the Hieronymic <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a>, and in the ninth certury in the martyrologies of Wandalbert of Pr&uuml;m and of Ramanus Maurus. This feast is celebrated on 11 August. The institution of the feast of his exhumation, 18 November, and of his translation, 24 September dates probably from 1245, as his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were exhumed in that year by Bishop Guido of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>. <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">Relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> are preserved at Ste-Marie de Liessies, at the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of St-G&eacute;ry at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, at the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of the same name at <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a>, at St-Donatien at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, at St. Pierre at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, and in other churches of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. St-G&eacute;ry is the patron of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, subsidiary patron of <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, and he is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a protector at Braine-le-Comte (Hainaut, Belgiurn). On the <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> in the form of an <a href="../cathen/11344a.htm">ostensorium</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, which contains the skull of St. G&eacute;ry, he is represented in the attire of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> on head, without his <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>, right hand lifted in a gesture of benediction and left folded upon his breast.
