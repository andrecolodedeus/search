<h1>St. Hedwig</h1>  

<p>Duchess of Silesia, b. about 1174, at the castle of Andechs; d. at <a href="../cathen/15029a.htm">Trebnitz</a>, 12 or 15 October, 1243. She was one of eight children born to Berthold IV, Count of Andechs and Duke of Croatia and <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>. Of her four brothers, two became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Ekbert of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, and Berthold of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>; Otto succeeded his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> as Duke of <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>, and Heinrich became Margrave of Istria. Of her three sisters, Gertrude married Andrew II, King of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, from which union sprang St. Elizabeth, Landgravine of Thuringia; Mechtilde became <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Kitzingen; while Agnes was made the unlawful wife of Philip II of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1196, on the repudiation of his lawful wife, Ingeborg, but was dismissed in 1200, <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> having laid <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> under an <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>. Hedwig was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Kitzingen, and, according to an old biography, at the age of twelve (1186), was married to Henry I of Silesia (b. 1168), who in 1202 succeeded his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> Boleslaw as Duke of Silesia. Henry's mother was a German; he himself had been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; and now through his wife he was brought into still closer relations with <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Henry I was an energetic prince, who greatly extended the boundaries of his duchy, established his authority on a firm basis, and rendered important services to civilization in the realm. For this purpose he encouraged to the utmost the spread of the more highly developed civilization existing in the German territories adjoining his to the west, so that <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a> became German in language and customs.

<p>Hedwig now took a prominent part in the beneficent administration of her husband. Her <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> won for her great influence in the government of the land. In particular she gave her support to new monastic foundations and assisted those already in existence. It was chiefly through the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> that German civilization was spread in <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a>. Henry and Hedwig endowed munificently the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09204a.htm">Leubus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Vincent, and the foundation of the Canons of St. Augustine at <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>. The following <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were established: the Augustinian <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of Naumburg on the Bober (1217), later transferred to Sagan, the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Heinrichau (1227), and the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a> at Kamenz (1210). St. Hedwig brought the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> to Bunzlau and Breslau, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> to Goldberg (1212) and later to Krossen. The <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> established a house at Klein-Oels. Henry was also the founder of the Hospital of the Holy Ghost at <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a> (1214), and Hedwig tended with disinterested charity the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at Neumarkt. At the instance of his saintly wife, the duke then founded at his own expense, and on ground donated by himself the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> at <a href="../cathen/15029a.htm">Trebnitz</a> (1202), and generously endowed it. This was the first house of religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> came from <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> and took possession of their new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> early in 1203. The first <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> is said to have been Petrussa, succeeded by Bl. Gertrude, a daughter of Henry and Hedwig, who at an early age had been <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to Otto von Wittelsbach. After he <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> the German King Philip of Swabia (1208), the <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a> was annulled and Gertrude entered the Abbey of Trebnitz (before 1212), where she later became <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>.

<p>For some years after her marriage, Hedwig resided chiefly at <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>. She had seven children. A son, Boleslaw, and two daughters, Sophia and Agnes, died at an early age; Henry succeeded to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> title; Conrad died while still a young man, in consequence of a fall from his horse (c. 1214); and Gertrude embraced the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. On <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>, 1208, another son of Hedwig's was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, probably not identical with the above-mentioned Boleslaw, who had died before this time. On the suggestion of Hedwig, after the birth of this last child, she and her husband led a virgin life (1209), and pronounced a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of chastity before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>. Duke Henry took the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and allowed his <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a> to grow, like the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> (whence his sobriquet of "the Bearded"). From this time forward Hedwig spent much of her time at the Abbey of Trebnitz, where, on the death of her husband (1238), she took up her permanent abode, that she might devote herself unreservedly to exercises of <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> as well as to <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>. She transferred to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> her inheritance of Schawoine. Hedwig had had many trials and tribulations. In the year 1227 her husband, with Duke Lesko of <a href="../cathen/13436b.htm">Sandomir</a>, was treacherously set upon by Swantopolk, Duke of <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>, and severely wounded. Hedwig immediately hastened to Gonsawa, where the bloody deed had taken place, to care for her husband. Lesko had been killed, and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> now broke out between Henry of Silesia and Conrad of Masovia over the possession of Cracow. Conrad was defeated, but succeeded in surprising Henry in a church attending Divine service and led him captive to Plock (1229). Hedwig forthwith went to her husband's assistance, and her very appearance made such an impression on Conrad of Masovia that he released the duke.

<p>Of Hedwig's children, only Gertrude survived her; Duke Henry II fell at Wahlstatt (1241) in a battle against the Tatars. After her husband's death, Hedwig took the grey habit of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, but was not received into the order as a religious, that she might retain the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to spend her revenues in charities. The duchess practised severe <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, endured all trials with the greatest resignation, with self-denying charity cared for the sick and supported the poor; in her interior life of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, she gave herself up to meditation on <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> things. Her <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and gentleness won for her even during life the reputation of a saint. She was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the church attached to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a>, 26 March, 1267, and on 25 August of the same year her remains were raised to the honours of the altar. Her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated 17 October; she in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as the patroness of Silesia.

<p>With St. Hedwig as patroness, R. Spiske, later canon at <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, founded, in 1848, a pious association of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and young girls, from which developed the congregation of the Sisters of St. Hedwig, established in 1859, at <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, under the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>, and constitutions approved by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Their chief aim is the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphaned</a> and abandoned children; they also conduct <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for little girls and trade <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Their activity extends chiefly over <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, but they also have a house in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. The sisters number about three hundred, with mother-house at <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>.
