<h1>St. Hegesippus</h1>  

<p>(Roman Martyrology, 7 April).

<p>A writer of the second century, known to us almost exclusively from <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, who tells us that he wrote in five books in the simplest style the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> tradition of the Apostolic preaching. His work was entitled <em>hypomnemata</em> (Memoirs), and was written against the new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> and of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>. He appealed principally to tradition as embodied in the teaching which had been handed down in the Churches through the succession of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> was wrong in supposing him to have composed a history. He was clearly an <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and not a <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">"Judaeo-Christian"</a>, though <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> says he showed that he was a convert from <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, for he quoted from the Hebrew, he was acquainted with the Gospel according to the Hebrews and with a Syriac Gospel, and he also cited unwritten traditions of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. He seems to have belonged to some part of the East, possibly Palestine. He went on a journey to Corinth and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in the course of which he met many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and he heard from all the same <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. He says: "And the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Corinthians remained in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> word until Primus was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in Corinth; I made their acquaintance in my journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and remained with the Corinthians many days, in which we were refreshed with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> word. And when I was in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, I made a succession up to Anicetus, whose <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> was Eleutherus. And in each succession and in each city all is according to the ordinances of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and the Prophets and the Lord" (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, IV, 22).

<p>Many attempts have been made to show that <em>diadochen epoiesamen</em>, "I made for myself a succession," is not clear, and cannot mean, "I made for myself a list of the succession of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>." A conjectural emendation by Halloix and Savile, <em>diatriben epoiesamen</em>, is based on the version by Rufinus (permansi inibi), and has been accepted by Harnack, McGiffert, and Zahn. But the proposed reading makes nonsense: "And being in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, I made a stay there till Anicetus." When did he arrive? And what does "till Anicetus" mean? <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> cannot have read this, for he says that Hegesippus came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under Anicetus and stayed until Eleutherus. The best scholars have accepted the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> text without difficulty, among others Lipsius, Lightfoot, Renan, Duchesne, Weizsaecker, Salmon, Caspari, Funk, Turner, Bardenhewer. In fact <em>diadoche</em> had then a technical meaning, which is precisely found in the next sentence, where "in each succession and in each city", may be paraphrased "in each list of bishops in every city", the argument being that of St. Iren&aelig;us (Adv. Haer., III, 3): "We are able to enumerate those who were made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the Churches by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, and their successions up till our own time, and they have taught and known nothing resembling the wild dreams of these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>." The addition of Soter and Eleutherus is intended by the writer to bring his original catalogue up to date.

<p>With great ingenuity Lightfoot has found traces of this list in St. Epiphanius, Haer., XXVII, 6, where that saint of the fourth century carelessly says: Marcellina came to us lately and destroyed many, in the days of Anicetus, Bishop of Rome", and then refers to "the above catalogue", though he has given none. He is clearly quoting a writer who was at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the time of Anicetus and made a list of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> beginning with St. Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in the twelfth year of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>. A list which has some curious agreements with Epiphanius, and extends only to Anicetus, is found in the poem of Pseudo-Tertullian against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>; the author has mistaken Marcellina for <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>. The same list is at the base of the earlier part of the Liberian Catalogue, doubtless from <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> (see under <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">CLEMENT I</a>). It seems fairly certain that the list of Hegesippus was also used by <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, Africanus, and <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> in forming their own. It should be said, however, that not only Harnack and Zahn, but Funk and Bardenhewer, have rejected Lightfoot's view, though on weak grounds. It is probable that <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> borrowed his list of the early <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> from Hegesippus.

<p><a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> quotes from Hegesippus a long and apparently legendary account of the death of St. James, <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">"the brother of the Lord"</a>, also the story of the election of his successor Symeon, and the summoning of the descendants of St. Jude to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>. A list of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> against which Hegesippus wrote is also cited. We learn from a note in the Bodleian <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> Barocc. 142 (De Boor in "Texte und Unters.", V, ii, 169) that the names of the two grandsons of St. Jude were given by Hegesippus as Zoker and James. Dr. Lawlor has shown (Hermathena, XI, 26, 1900, p. 10) that all these passages cited by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> were connected in the original, and were in the fifth book of Hegesippus. He has also made it probable (Journal of Theol. Studies, April, 1907, VIII, 436) that <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> got from Hegesippus the statement that St. John was exiled to Patmos by <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>. Hegesippus mentioned the letter of Clement to the Corinthians, apparently in connection with the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>. It is very likely that the dating of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> according to <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> reigns in <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> and Epiphanius &#151; e.g., that Cerdon and Valentius came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under Anicetus, etc. &#151; was derived from Hegesippus, and the same may be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the assertion that Hermas was the brother of <a href="../cathen/12126b.htm">Pope Pius</a> (so the Liberian Catalogue, the poem against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10642a.htm">Muratorian fragment</a>). The date of Hegesippus is fixed by the statement that the death and apotheosis of Antinous were in his own time (130), that he came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under Anicetus (154-7 to 165-8) and wrote in the time of Eleutherus (174-6 to 189-91). Zahn has shown that the work of Hegesippus was still extant in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in three Eastern <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>.

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The fragments of Hegesippus, including that published by De Boor (above) and one cited from Stephen Gobaras by Photius (Bibl. 232), have been elaborately commented upon by Zahn, Forschungen zur Gesch. des N.T. Kanons (Leipzig, 1900), VI, 228 sqq., who discusses other traces of Hegesippus. On the papal catalogue see Lightfoot, Clement of Rome (London, 1890), I, 327, etc.; Funk, Kirchengesch.
