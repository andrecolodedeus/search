<h1>St. Helen of Sk&ouml;fde</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a> in the first half of the twelfth century. Her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated 31 July. Her life (Acta SS., July, VII, 340) is ascribed to St. Brynolph, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/16074b.htm">Skara</a>, in Sweden (d. 1317). She was of noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and is generally believed to have been the daughter of the Jarl Guthorm. When her husband died she remained a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> and spent her life in <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; the gates of her home were ever open to the needy and the church of Sk&ouml;fde was almost entirely built at her expense. Her daughter's husband was a very cruel man, and was in consequence killed by his own servants. His relatives, wishing to avenge his death, examined the servants. These admitted the crime, but falsely asserted that they acted on the instigation of Helen. She had then gone on a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the Holy Land, but on her return she was killed in 1160 (?) at Gothene by her husband's relatives. Her body was brought to Sk&ouml;fde for burial, and many wonderful cures were wrought at her intercession. The report of these <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Stephen, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15207a.htm">Upsala</a>, and he, by order of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Pope Alexander III</a>, in 1164 inscribed her name in the list of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> (<a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, "De canonizatione sanctorum", I, 85). Great was the veneration shown her <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> even after the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> had spread in <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>. Near her church was a holy well, known to this day as St. Lene Kild. At various times the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> authorities inveighed against this remnant of what they called popish and anti-Christian <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>. Especially <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in this regard was Archbishop Abraham, who had all the springs, mineral or pure water, filled up with stones and rubbish (Baring-Gould, "Lives of the Saints", July, II, 698). St. Helen's <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> and well (St. Elin's) were also <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> at Tiisvilde in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Tibirke in the island of Zealand. Pilgrimages were made every summer, cripples and sick came in numbers; they would remain all night at the grave, take away with them little bags of earth from under the tombstone, and frequently would leave their crutches or make votive offerings in token of gratitude. Such was the report sent in 1658 from Copenhagen to the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Lindanus. A similar statement is made by Werlaiff, in 1858, in his "Hist. Antegnelser". The legend says that St. Helen's body floated to Tiisvilde in a stone coffin, and that a spring broke forth where the coffin touched land. The <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> (loc. cit.) give as a possible reason for her veneration at Tiisvilde that perhaps St. Helen had visited the place, or some of her <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> had been brought there.
