<div id="springfield2">
<h1>St. Helena</h1>  

<p>The mother of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>, born about the middle of the third century, possibly in Drepanum (later known as Helenopolis) on the Nicomedian Gulf; died about 330. She was of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> parentage; <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, in his "Oratio de obitu Theodosii", referred to her as a <em>stabularia</em>, or inn-keeper. Nevertheless, she became the lawful wife of Constantius Chlorus. Her first and only son, Constantine, was born in Naissus in Upper Moesia, in the year 274. The statement made by English chroniclers of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, according to which Helena was supposed to have been the daughter of a British prince, is entirely without historical foundation. It may arise from the misinterpretation of a term used in the fourth chapter of the panegyric on Constantine's marriage with Fausta, that Constantine, oriendo (i.e., "by his beginnings," "from the outset") had <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> Britain, which was taken as an allusion to his birth, whereas the reference was really to the beginning of his reign.

<p>In the year 292 Constantius, having become co-Regent of the West, gave himself up to considerations of a political nature and forsook Helena in order to marry Theodora, the step-daughter of <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Emperor Maximinianus</a> Herculius, his patron, and well-wisher. But her son remained faithful and loyal to her. On the death of Constantius Chlorus, in 308, Constantine, who succeeded him, summoned his mother to the imperial court, conferred on her the title of <a href="../cathen/02078b.htm">Augusta</a>, ordered that all <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> should be paid her as the mother of the sovereign, and had <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> struck bearing her effigy. Her son's influence caused her to embrace <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> after his victory over <a href="../cathen/10073b.htm">Maxentius</a>. This is directly attested by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (Vita Constantini, III, xlvii): "She (his mother) became under his (Constantine's) influence such a devout servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that one might believe her to have been from her very childhood a disciple of the Redeemer of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>". It is also clear from the declaration of the contemporary historian of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that <a href="../cathen/07203a.htm">Helena</a>, from the time of her <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> had an earnestly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life and by her influence and liberality favoured the wider spread of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Tradition links her name with the building of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> churches in the cities of the West, where the imperial court resided, notably at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and there is no reason for rejecting this tradition, for we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> positively through <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> that <a href="../cathen/07203a.htm">Helena</a> erected churches on the hallowed spots of Palestine. Despite her advanced age she undertook a journey to Palestine when Constantine, through his victory over Licinius, had become sole master of the Roman Empire, subsequently, therefore, to the year 324. It was in Palestine, as we learn from <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (loc. cit., xlii), that she had resolved to bring to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the King of kings, the homage and tribute of her devotion. She lavished on that land her bounties and good deeds, she "explored it with remarkable discernment", and "visited it with the care and solicitude of the emperor himself". Then, when she "had shown due veneration to the footsteps of the Saviour", she had two churches erected for the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: one was raised in Bethlehem near the Grotto of the Nativity, the other on the Mount of the Ascension, near <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. She also embellished the sacred grotto with rich ornaments. This sojourn in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the starting-point of the legend first recorded by Rufinus as to the discovery of the Cross of Christ.

<p>Her princely munificence was such that, according to <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, she assisted not only <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> but entire communities. The poor and destitute were the special objects of her charity. She visited the churches everywhere with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and made them rich donations. It was thus that, in fulfilment of the Saviour's precept, she brought forth abundant fruit in word and deed. If Helena conducted herself in this manner while in the Holy Land, which is indeed testified to by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03133b.htm">Caesarea</a> in Palestine, we should not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that she manifested the same <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and benevolence in those other cities of the empire in which she resided after her <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>. Her memory in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is chiefly identified with the church of S. Croce in Gerusalemme. On the present location of this church formerly stood the <em>Palatium Sessorianum</em>, and near by were the <em>Thermae Helenianae</em>, which baths derived their name from the empress. Here two inscriptions were found composed in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/07203a.htm">Helena</a>. The <em>Sessorium</em>, which was near the site of the Lateran, probably served as Helena's residence when she stayed in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; so that it is quite possible for a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> basilica to have been erected on this spot by Constantine, at her suggestion and in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">true Cross</a>.

<p>Helena was still living in the year 326, when Constantine ordered the execution of his son Crispus. When, according to <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates'</a> account (<a href="../fathers/26011.htm"><em>Church History</em> I.17</a>), the emperor in 327 improved Drepanum, his mother's native town, and decreed that it should be called Helenopolis, it is probable that the latter returned from Palestine to her son who was then residing in the Orient. Constantine was with her when she died, at the advanced age of eighty years or thereabouts (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/25023.htm"><em>Life of Constantine</em> III.46</a>). This must have been about the year 330, for the last <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> which are known to have been stamped with her name bore this date. Her body was brought to Constantinople and laid to rest in the imperial vault of the church of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. It is presumed that her remains were transferred in 849 to the Abbey of Hautvillers, in the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Archdiocese of Reims</a>, as recorded by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Altmann in his "Translatio". She was revered as a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, and the veneration spread, early in the ninth century, even to Western countries. Her feast falls on 18 August.
