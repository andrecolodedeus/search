<div id="springfield2">
<h1>St. Henry II</h1>  

<p>German King and Holy Roman Emperor, son of Duke Henry II (the Quarrelsome) and of the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> Princess Gisela; b. 972; d. in his palace of Grona, at Gottingen, 13 July, 1024.

<p>Like his predecessor, <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a>, he had the literary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of his time. In his youth he had been destined for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Therefore he became acquainted with <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> interests at an early age.

<p>Willingly he performed <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> practices, gladly also he strengthened the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, without, however, ceasing to regard <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions as pivots of his power, according to the views of <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto the Great</a>. With all his learning and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, Henry was an eminently sober man, endowed with sound, practical common sense. He went his way circumspectly, never attempting anything but the possible and, wherever it was practicable, applying the methods of amiable and reasonable good sense. This <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, however, was combined with energy and conscientiousness. Sick and suffering from fever, he traversed the empire in order to maintain peace. At all times he used his power to adjust troubles. The masses especially he wished to help.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as the constitutional Church of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and therefore as the advocate of German unity and of the claims of inherited succession, raised Henry to the throne. The new king straightway resumed the policy of <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a> both in domestic and in foreign affairs. This policy first appeared in his treatment of the Eastern Marches. The encroachments of Duke Boleslaw, who had founded a great kingdom, impelled him to intervene. But his success was not marked.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the local and national opposition to the universalism of the German king had found a champion in Arduin of <a href="../cathen/08258a.htm">Ivrea</a>. The latter assumed the Lombard crown in 1002. In 1004 Henry crossed the Alps. Arduin yielded to his superior power. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> now <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> him King of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. This rapid success was largely due to the fact that a large part of the Italian episcopate upheld the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the Roman Empire and that of the unity of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>.

<p>On his second expedition to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, occasioned by the dispute between the Counts of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> and the Crescentians over the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne, he was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor on 14 February, 1014. But it was not until later, on his third expedition to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, that he was able to restore the prestige of the empire completely.

<p>Before this happened, however, he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to intervene in the west. Disturbances were especially prevalent throughout the entire north-west. Lorraine caused great trouble. The Counts of Lutzelburg (Luxemburg), brothers-in-law of the king, were the heart and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the disaffection in that country. Of these men, Adalbero had made himself <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> by uncanonical methods (1003); but he was not recognized any more than his brother Theodoric, who had had himself elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>.

<p>True to his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, the king could not be induced to abet any selfish <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> policy at the expense of the empire. Even though Henry, on the whole, was able to hold his own against these Counts of Lutzelburg, still the royal authority suffered greatly by loss of prestige in the north-west.

<p>Burgundy afforded compensation for this. The lord of that country was Rudolph, who, to protect himself against his vassals, joined the party of Henry II, the son of his sister, Gisela, and to Henry the childless duke bequeathed his duchy, despite the opposition of the nobles (1006). Henry had to undertake several campaigns before he was able to enforce his claims. He did not achieve any tangible result, he only bequeathed the theoretical claims on <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> to his successors.

<p>Better fortune awaited the king in the central and eastern parts of the empire. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that he had a quarrel with the Conradinians over Carinthia and Swabia: but Henry <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> victorious because his kingdom rested on the solid foundation of intimate alliance with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>That his attitude towards the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was dictated in part by practical reasons, primarily he promoted the institutions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> chiefly in order to make them more useful supports his royal power, is clearly shown by his policy. How boldly Henry posed as the real ruler of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> appears particularly in the establishment of the See of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, which was entirely his own scheme.

<p>He carried out this measure, in 1007, in spite of the energetic opposition of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Wurzburg against this change in the organization of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The primary purpose of the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> was the germanization of the regions on the Upper Main and the Regnitz, where the Wends had fixed their homes. As a large part of the environs of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> belonged to the king, he was able to furnish rich endowments for the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. The importance of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> lay principally in the field of culture, which it promoted chiefly by its prosperous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Henry, therefore, relied on the aid of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against the lay powers, which had become quite formidable. But he made no concessions to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>Though naturally <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, and though well acquainted with <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> culture, he was at bottom a stranger to her spirit. He disposed of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> autocratically. Under his rule the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, from whom he demanded unqualified obedience, seemed to be nothing but officials of the empire. He demanded the same obedience from the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>. However, this political dependency did not injure the internal life of the German Church under Henry. By means of its <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> resources the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had a blessed influence in this epoch.

<p>But it was precisely this civilizing power of the German Church that aroused the suspicions of the reform party. This was significant, because Henry was more and more won over to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of this party. At a synod at Goslar he confirmed decrees that tended to realize the demands made by the reform party. Ultimately this tendency could not fail to subvert the Othonian system, moreover could not fail to awaken the opposition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> as it was constituted.

<p>This hostility on the part of the German Church came to a head in the emperor's dispute with Archbishop Aribo of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. Aribo was an opponent of the reform movement of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Cluny. The Hammerstein marriage imbroglio afforded the opportunity he desired to offer a bold front against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Otto von Hammerstein had been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by Aribo on account of his marriage with Irmengard, and the latter had successfully appealed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>This called forth the opposition of the Synod of Seligenstadt, in 1023, which forbade an appeal to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> without the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. This step meant open rebellion against the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of church unity, and its ultimate result would have been the founding of a German national Church. In this dispute the emperor was entirely on the side of the reform party. He even wanted to institute international proceedings against the unruly <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> by means of treaties with the French king. But his death prevented this.

<p>Before this Henry had made his third journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1021. He came at the request of the loyal <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who had warned him at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> of the dangerous aspect of the Italian situation, and also of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who sought him out at <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> in 1020. Thus the imperial power, which had already begun to withdraw from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, was summoned back thither. This time the object was to put an end to the supremacy of the Greeks in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. His success was not complete; he succeeded, however, in restoring the prestige of the empire in northern and central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>.

<p>Henry was far too reasonable a man to think seriously of readopting the imperialist plans of his predecessors. He was satisfied to have ensured the dominant position of the empire in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> within reasonable bounds. Henry's power was in fact controlling, and this was in no small degree due to the fact that he was primarily engaged in solidifying the national foundations of his authority.

<p>The later <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legends have ascribed ascetic traits to this ruler, some of which certainly cannot withstand serious criticism. For instance, the highly varied theme of his virgin marriage to Cunegond has certainly no basis in fact.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> this emperor in 1146, and his wife Cunegond in 1200.
