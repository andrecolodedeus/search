<h1>St. Herbert of Derwentwater</h1>  

<p>(Hereberht).

<p>Date of birth unknown; d. 20 March, 687; an <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorite</a> of the seventh century, who dwelt for many years on the little island still known as St. Herbert's Isle, in the Lake of Derwentwater. He was for long the friend and disciple of <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a> of <a href="../cathen/09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a>. Little is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> about him, save that it was his custom every year to visit <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a> for the purpose of receiving his direction in spiritual matters. In the year 686, hearing that his friend was visiting Carlisle for the purpose of giving the veil to Queen Eormenburg, he went to see him there, instead of at <a href="../cathen/09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a> as was usual. After they had spoken together, <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a> said, "Brother Herbert, tell to me now all that you have need to ask or speak, for never shall we see one another again in this world. For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the time of my decease is at hand." Then Herbert fell weeping at his feet and begged that <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a> would obtain for him the grace that they might both be admitted to praise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> at the same time. And <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> and then made answer, "Rise, my brother, weep not, but rejoice that the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has granted our desire." And so it happened. For Herbert, returning to his hermitage, fell ill of a long sickness, and, purified of his imperfections, passed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on the very day on which <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a> died on Holy Island. It is said that the remains of St. Herbert's <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and cell may still be traced at the northern end of the island on which he lived. In 1374 Thomas Appleby, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03349b.htm">Carlisle</a>, granted an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of forty days to all who, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Herbert, visited the island in Derwentwater and were present at the Mass of <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a> to be sung annually by the <a href="../cathen/15401a.htm">Vicar</a> of Crosthwaite.
