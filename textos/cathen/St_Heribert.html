<h1>St. Heribert</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>; born at Worms, c. 970; died at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, 16 March, 1021. His father was Duke Hugo of Worms. After receiving his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Worms, he spent some time as guest at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Gorze, after which he became <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Worms. In 994 he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; in the same year King <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> appointed him chancellor for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and four years later also for <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, a position which he held until the death of <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> on 23 January, 1002. As chancellor he was the most influential adviser of <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a>, whom he accompanied to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 906 and again in 997. He was still in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> when, in 999, he was elected <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>. At <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> he received <a href="../cathen/08084b.htm">ecclesiastical investiture</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> from <a href="../cathen/14371a.htm">Pope Sylvester II</a> on 9 July, 999, and on the following <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a> he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>. In 1002 he was present at the death-bed of the youthful emperor at Paterno. While returning to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> with the emperor's remains and the imperial insignia, he was held captive for some time by the future King Henry II, whose candidacy he first opposed. As soon as Henry II was elected king, on 7 June, 1002, Heribert acknowledged him as such, accompanied him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1004, mediated between him and the House of Luxemburg, and served him faithfully in many other ways; but he never won his entire confidence until the year 1021, when the king saw his mistake and humbly begged pardon on the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Heribert founded and richly endowed the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and church of Deutz, where he lies <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a>. He was already <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a saint during his lifetime. Between 1073 and 1075 he was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Pope Gregory VII</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 16 March.
