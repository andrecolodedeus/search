<h1>St. Hermengild</h1>  

<p>Date of birth unknown; d. 13 April, 585. Leovigild, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> King of the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a> (569-86), had two sons, Hermengild and Reccared, by his first marriage with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Princess Theodosia. Hermengild married, in 576, Ingundis, a <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> princess, the daughter of Sigebert and Brunhilde. Led by his own inclination, and influenced by his wife as well as by the instructions of <a href="../cathen/09102a.htm">St. Leander of Seville</a>, he entered the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> fold. Leovigild's second wife, Goswintha, a fanatical <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> her daughter-in-law and sought by ill-treatment to force her to abandon the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Hermengild had accordingly withdrawn, with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> sanction, to <a href="../cathen/01465b.htm">Andalusia</a>, and had taken his wife with him. But when Leovigild learned of his son's conversion he summoned him back to Toledo, which command Hermengild did not obey. The fanatical <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> of his step-mother, and his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> severe treatment of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, stirred him to take up arms in protection of his oppressed co-religionists and in defence of his own <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. At the same time he formed an alliance with the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a>. Leovigold took the field against his son in 582, prevailed on the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> to betray Hermengild for a sum of 30,000 gold <em>solidi</em>, besieged the latter in Seville in 583, and captured the city after a siege of nearly two years. Hermengild sought refuge in a church at <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>, whence he was enticed by the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> promises of Leovigild, who stripped him in camp of his royal raiment and banished him to Valencia (584). His wife, Ingundis, fled with her son to <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, where she died, after which the boy was given, by order of Emperor Mauritius, into the hands of his grandmother Brunhilde. We are not fully informed as to Hermengild's subsequent fate.

<p><a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> relates (Dialogi, III, 31, in P.L. LXVII, 289-93) that Leovigild sent an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to him in his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, on <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Easter Eve</a> of 585, with a promise that he would forgive him all, provided he consented to receive <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> from the hands of this <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. But Hermengild firmly refused thus to <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjure</a> his <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, and was in consequence beheaded on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Day</a>. He was later <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> (1585), acting on the suggestion of King Philip II, extended the celebration of his feast (13 April) throughout the whole of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>.
