<h1>St. Hilarion</h1>  

<p>Founder of <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchoritic</a> life in Palestine; born at Tabatha, south of <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a>, Palestine, about 291; died in the island of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> about 371. The chief source of information regarding him is the biography written by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (P.L. XXIII, 29-54). In the introduction Jerome mentions a letter from <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13393a.htm">Salamis</a>, in regard to the life of Hilarion whom Epiphanius had known personally during the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit's</a> later years. The letter is not extant. A newly discovered life has been edited by Papadopulos-Kerameus (<em>Analekta Ierosolymikes Stachyologias</em>, V, 1898). Some special circumstances regarding Hilarion are related by the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical historian</a>, <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, from oral traditions handed down by Hilarion's disciples; among others that <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen's</a> grandfather and another relative were <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by Hilarion (<a href="../fathers/26025.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.15</a>).

<p>Hilarion was the son of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. The date of his birth is ascertained from the statement of Jerome (Vita, c. xxv), that Hilarion, at the death of Anthony (356), was 65 years old. As a boy Hilarion's <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> sent him to Alexandria to be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in its <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Here he became a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and at the age of fifteen, attracted by the renown of the <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorite</a>, St. Anthony, he retired to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. After two months of personal intercourse with the great "Father of Anchorites", Hilarion resolved to devote himself to the ascetic life of a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>. He returned home, divided his fortune among the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and then withdrew to a little hut in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Majuma, near <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a>, where he led a life similar to that of St. Anthony. His clothing consisted of a hair shirt, an upper garment of skins, and a short shepherd's cloak; he <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> rigorously, not partaking of his frugal meal until after sunset, and supported himself by weaving baskets. The greater part of his time was devoted to religious exercises. <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">Miraculous</a> cures and <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcisms of demons</a> which he performed spread his fame in the surrounding country, so that in 329 numerous disciples assembled round him. Many <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> were converted, and people came to seek his help and counsel in such great numbers that he could hardly find time to perform his religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. This induced him to bid farewell to his disciples and to return to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> about the year 360. Here he visited the places where St. Anthony had lived and the spot where he had died. On the journey thither, he met Dracontius and Philor, two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> banished by the Emperor Constantius. Hilarion then went to dwell at Bruchium, near <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, but hearing that <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a> had ordered his arrest, he retired to an oasis in the Libyan <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. Later on he journeyed to <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and for a long time lived as a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> near the promontory of Pachinum. His disciple, Hesychius, who had long sought him, discovered him here and soon Hilarion saw himself again surrounded by disciples desirous of following his holy example.

<p>Leaving <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, he went to Epidaurus in <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>, where, on the occasion of a great earthquake (366), he rendered valuable assistance to the inhabitants. Finally he went to <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> and there, in a lonely cave in the interior of the island, he spent his last years. It was during his sojourn in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> that he became acquainted with <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13393a.htm">Salamis</a>. Before his death, which took place at the age of eighty, Hilarion bequeathed his only possession, his poor and scanty clothing, to his faithful disciple, Hesychius. His body was buried near the town of <a href="../cathen/11457b.htm">Paphos</a>, but Hesychius secretly took it away and carried it to Majuma where the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> had lived so long. Hilarion was greatly honored as the founder of <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchoritic</a> life in Palestine. His feast falls on 21 October. The attempts of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and of other historians to relegate Hilarion to the realm of <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> have completely failed; there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the historical fact of his life and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of its chief features.
