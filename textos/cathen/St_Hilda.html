<h1>St. Hilda</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a>, born 614; died 680. Practically speaking, all our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of St. Hilda is derived from the pages of <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>. She was the daughter of Hereric, the nephew of <a href="../cathen/05323b.htm">King Edwin of Northumbria</a>, and she seems like her great-uncle to have become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> through the preaching of <a href="../cathen/11585a.htm">St. Paulinus</a> about the year 627, when she was thirteen years old.

<p>Moved by the example of her sister <a href="../cathen/07256a.htm">Hereswith</a>, who, after marrying Ethelhere of East Anglia, became a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> at Chelles in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, Hilda also journeyed to East Anglia, intending to follow her sister abroad. But <a href="../cathen/01233d.htm">St. Aidan</a> recalled her to her own country, and after leading a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">monastic life</a> for a while on the north bank of the Wear and afterwards at Hartlepool, where she ruled a <a href="../cathen/10452a.htm">double monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> with great success, Hilda eventually undertook to set in order a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Streaneshalch, a place to which the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danes</a> a century or two later gave the name of <a href="../cathen/15609c.htm">Whitby</a>.

<p>Under the rule of St. Hilda the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/15609c.htm">Whitby</a> became very famous. The <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a> were specially studied there, and no less than five of the inmates became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/08469b.htm">St. John</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Hexham</a>, and still more <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, rendering untold service to the <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">Anglo-Saxon Church</a> at this critical period of the struggle with <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>. Here, in 664, was held the important <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> at which King Oswy, convinced by the arguments of <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a>, decided the observance of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> and other moot points. St. Hilda herself later on seems to have sided with Theodore against Wilfrid. The fame of St. Hilda's wisdom was so great that from far and near <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and even royal personages came to consult her.

<p>Seven years before her death the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was stricken down with a grievous fever which never left her till she breathed her last, but, in spite of this, she neglected none of her <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or to her subjects. She passed away most peacefully after receiving the <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">Holy Viaticum</a>, and the tolling of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> <a href="../cathen/02418b.htm">bell</a> was heard <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> at Hackness thirteen miles away, where also a devout <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> named Begu saw the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of St. Hilda borne to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p>With St. Hilda is intimately connected the story of Caedmon, the sacred bard. When he was brought before St. Hilda she admitted him to take <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> in her <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, where he most piously died.

<p>The cultus of St. Hilda from an early period is attested by the inclusion of her name in the <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">calendar</a> of <a href="../cathen/15645a.htm">St. Willibrord</a>, written at the beginning of the eighth century. It was alleged at a later <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">remains</a> of St. Hilda were translated to <a href="../cathen/06579a.htm">Glastonbury</a> by <a href="../cathen/05295a.htm">King Edmund</a>, but this is only part of the "great <a href="../cathen/06579a.htm">Glastonbury</a> myth." Another story states that <a href="../cathen/05295a.htm">St. Edmund</a> brought her <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> to Gloucester. St. Hilda's <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> seems to have been kept on 17 November. There are a dozen or more old English churches <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to St. Hilda on the northeast coast and South Shields is probably a corruption of St. Hilda.
