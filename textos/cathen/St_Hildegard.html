<h1>St. Hildegard</h1>  

<p>Born at B&ouml;ckelheim on the Nahe, 1098; died on the Rupertsberg near Bingen, 1179; feast 17 September. The family name is unknown of this great seeress and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophetess</a>, called the Sibyl of the Rhine. The early biographers give the first names of her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> as Hildebert and Mechtildis (or Mathilda), speak of their nobility and riches, but give no particulars of their lives. Later writers call the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> Hildegard of B&ouml;ckelheim, of Rupertsberg, or of Bingen. Legends would make her a Countess of Spanheim. J. May (Katholik. XXXVII, 143) shows from letters and other documents that she probably belonged to the illustrious <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Stein, whose descendants are the present Princes of Salm. Her father was a soldier in the service of Meginhard, Count of Spanheim. Hildegard was a weak and sickly child, and in consequence received but little <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at home. Her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, though much engaged in worldly pursuits, had a religious disposition and had promised the child to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. At the age of eight she was placed under the care of Jutta, sister of Count Meginhard, who lived as a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluse</a> on the Disenberg (or Disibodenberg, Mount of <a href="../cathen/05037a.htm">St. Disibod</a>) in the <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Diocese of Speyer</a>. Here also Hildegard was given but little instruction since she was much afflicted with sickness, being frequently scarcely able to walk and often deprived even of the use of her eyes. She was taught to read and sing the Latin psalms, sufficient for the chanting of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, but never learned to write. Eventually she was invested with the habit of St. Benedict and made her <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>. Jutta died in 1136, and Hildegard was appointed superior. Numbers of aspirants flocked to the community and she decided to go to another locality, impelled also, as she says, by a Divine command. She chose Rupertsberg near Bingen on the left bank of the Rhine, about fifteen miles from Disenberg. After overcoming many difficulties and obtaining the permission of the lord of the place, Count Bernard of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, she settled in her new home with eighteen sisters in 1147 or 1148 (1149 or 1150 according to Delehaye). Probably in 1165 she founded another <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Eibingen on the right side of the Rhine, where a community had already been established in 1148, which, however, had no success.

<p>The life of Hildegard as child, religious, and superioress was an extraordinary one. Left much to herself on account of her ill health, she led an interior life, trying to make use of everything for her own sanctification. From her earliest years she was favoured with visions. She says of herself: <blockquote>Up to my fifteenth year I saw much, and related some of the things seen to others, who would inquire with astonishment, whence such things might come. I also wondered and during my sickness I asked one of my nurses whether she also saw similar things. When she answered no, a great fear befell me. Frequently, in my conversation, I would relate future things, which I saw as if present, but, noting the amazement of my listeners, I became more reticent.</blockquote>

<p>This condition continued to the end of her life. Jutta had noticed her gifts and made them known to a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, but, it seems, nothing was done at the time. When about forty years of age Hildegard received a command to publish to the world what she saw and heard. She hesitated, dreading what people might think or say, though she herself was fully convinced of the Divine character of the revelations. But, continually urged, rebuked, and threatened by the inner voice, she manifested all to her <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a>, and through him to the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> under whose <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> her community was placed. Then a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> was ordered to put in writing whatever she related; some of her <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> also frequently assisted her. The writings were submitted to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (Henry, 1145-53) and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, who pronounced them as coming from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The matter was also brought to the notice of Eugene III (1145-53) who was at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> in 1147. Albero of Cluny, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>, was commissioned to investigate and made a favourable report. Hildegard continued her writings. Crowds of people flocked to her from the neighbourhood and from all parts of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and Gaul, to hear words of wisdom from her lips, and to receive advice and help in corporal and spiritual ailments. These were not only from the common people, but men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of note in <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> were drawn by the report of her wisdom and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. Thus we read that Archbishop Heinrich of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, Archbishop Eberhard of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> and Abbot Ludwig of <a href="../cathen/05594a.htm">St. Eucharius</a> at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, paid her visits. <a href="../cathen/05392a.htm">St. Elizabeth of Sch&ouml;nau</a> was an intimate friend and frequent visitor. <a href="../cathen/15062a.htm">Trithemius</a> in his "Chronicle" speaks of a visit of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard of Clairvaux</a>, but this probably was not correct. Not only at home did she give counsel, but also abroad. Many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of all stations of life wrote to her and received answers, so that her correspondence is quite extensive. Her great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and its interests caused her to make many journeys; she visited at intervals the houses of Disenberg and Eibingen; on invitation she came to Ingelheim to see Emperor Frederick; she travelled to <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, and the vicinity of Ulm, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, Werden, <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>. It is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, however, that she saw <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> or the grave of St. Martin at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>.

<p>In the last year of her life Hildegard had to undergo a very severe trial. In the cemetery adjoining her <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> a young man was buried who had once been under <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> demanded that she have the body removed. She did not consider herself bound to obey since the young man had received the last <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and was therefore supposed to have been reconciled to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Sentence of <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> was placed on her <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> by the chapter of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and the sentence was confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Christian (V) Buch, then in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. After much worry and correspondence she succeeded in having the <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> removed. She died a holy death and was buried in the church of Rupertsberg.



<p>Hildegard was greatly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in life and after death. Her biographer, Theodoric, calls her saint, and many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are said to have been wrought through her intercession. <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> (1227-41) and <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> (1243-54) ordered a process of information which was repeated by <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> (1305-14) and <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> (1316-34). No formal <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> has ever taken place, but her name is in the Roman Martyrology and her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated in the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and Limburg, also in the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/14133b.htm">Solesmes</a>, where a proper office is said (Brev. Monast. Tornac., 18 Sept.). When the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> on the Rupertsberg was destroyed in 1632 the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> were brought to Cologne and then to Eibingen. At the secularization of this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> they were placed in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of the place. In 1857 an official recognition was made by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09260a.htm">Limburg</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were placed on an altar specially built. At this occasion the town of Eibingen chose her as patron. On 2 July, 1900, the cornerstone was here laid for a new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Hildegard. The work was begun and completed through the munificence of Prince Karl of L&ouml;wenstein and <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> from St. Gabriel's at Prague entered the new home (17 Sept., 1904).

<p>All the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> found in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Eibingen were in 1814 transferred to the state <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> at Wiesbaden. Of this collection the first and greatest work of St. Hildegard is called "Scivias" (<em>Scire</em> or <em>vias Domini</em>, or <em>vias lucis</em>), parts of which had been shown to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. She began it in 1141 and worked at it for ten years. It is an extraordinary production and hard to understand, prophetic throughout and admonitory after the manner of Ezechiel and the Apocalypse. In the introduction she speaks of herself and describes the nature of her visions. Then follow three books, the first containing six visions, the second giving seven visions, and about double the size of the first; the third, equal in size to both the others, has thirteen visions. The "Scivias" represents <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on His Holy Mountain with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> at its base; tells of the original condition of man, his fall and <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>, the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and its struggles, the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a>, the times to come, the son of perdition and the end of the world. The visions are interspersed with salutary admonitions to live in the fear of the Lord. Manuscripts of the "Scivias" are also at Cues and Oxford. It was printed for the first time at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1513) in a book which contains also the writings of several other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. It was again printed at Cologne in 1628, and reproduced in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, PL 197. The "Liber vitae meritorum" written between 1158 and 1163, is a picturesque description of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian's</a> life of virtue and its opposite. It was printed for the first time in Pitra, "Analecta Sacra", VIII (Monte Cassino, 1882). The "Liber divinorum operum" (1163-70) is a contemplation of all nature in the light of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Sun, moon, and stars, the planets, the winds, animals, and man, are in her visions expressive of something <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> and spiritual, and as they come from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should lead back to Him (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, loc. cit.). <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, in "Baluzii Missell." (Lucca, 1761), II, 337, gives it from a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> lost since then. Her "Letter to the Prelates of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>" in regard to the <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> placed upon her <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> is placed here among her works by the Wiesbaden <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>; in others it is bound among her letters. To it the Wiesbaden <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> annexes nine small essays: on the Creation and fall of man; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> treatment of the renegade; on the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>; on the covenant between <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; on the Creation and Redemption; on the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of secular judges; on the praises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with intermingled <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. "Liber Epistolarum et Orationum"; the Wiesbaden <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> contains letters to and from <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugene III</a>, Anastasius IV, <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, King Conrad III, Emperor Frederick, <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, ten <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, nine <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, forty-nine <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> and provosts of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> or chapters, twenty-three abbesses, many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, teachers, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities (P.L., loc. cit.). Pitra has many additions; L. Clarus edited them in a German translation (Ratisbon, 1854). "Vita S. Disibodi" and "Vita S. Ruperti"; these "Vitae", which Hildegard claims also to be revelations, were probably made up from local traditions and, especially for <a href="../cathen/13229a.htm">St. Rupert</a>, the sources being very meagre, have only legendary value. "Expositio Evangeliorum" fifty <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> in allegory (Pitra, loc. cit.). "Lingua Ignota", the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, in eleven folios was a list of nine hundred words of an unknown language, mostly nouns and only a few adjectives, a Latin, and in a few cases a German, explanation, together with an unknown alphabet of twenty-three letters printed in Pitra. A collection of seventy <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and their melodies. A <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of this is also at <a href="../cathen/01179b.htm">Afflighem</a>, printed in Roth (Wiesbaden, 1880) and in Pitra. Not only in this work, but elsewhere Hildegard exhibits high poetical gifts, transfigured by her intimate persuasion of a Divine mission. "Liber Simplicis Medicinae" and "Liber Compositae Medicinae"; the first was edited in 1533 by Schott at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> as "Physica S Hildegardis", Dr. Jessen (1858) found a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of it in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of Wolfenbuttel. It consists of nine books treating of plants, elements, trees, stones, fishes, birds, quadrupeds, reptiles, metals, printed in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> as "Subtilitatum Diversarum Naturarum Libri Novem". In 1859, Jessen succeeded in obtaining from Copenhagen a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> entitled "Hildegardis Curae et Causae", and on examination felt satisfied that it was the second medical work of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. It is in five books and treats of the general divisions of created things, of the human body and its ailments, of the causes, symptoms, and treatment of diseases. "38 Solutiones Quaestionum" are answers to questions proposed by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Villars through <a href="../cathen/13783c.htm">Gilbert of Gembloux</a> on several texts of Scripture (P.L., loc. cit.). "Explanatio Regulae S. Benedicti", also called a revelation, exhibits the rule as understood and applied in those days by an intelligent and mild superior. "Explanatio Symboli S. Athanasii", an exhortation addressed to her sisters in religion. The "Revelatio Hildegardis de Fratribus Quatuor Ordinum Mendicantium", and the other prophecies against the Mendicants, etc., are forgeries. The "Speculum futurorum temporum" is a free adaptation of texts culled from her writings by Gebeno, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Eberbach (Pentachronicon, 1220). Some would impugn the genuineness of her writings, among others Preger in his "Gesch. der deutchen Mystik", 1874, but without sufficient reason. (See Hauck in "Kirchengesch. Deutschl.", IV,398 sqq.). Her correspondence is to be read with caution; three letters from <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> have been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> spurious by Von Winterfeld in "Neue Archiv", XXVII, 297.

<p>The first biography of St. Hildegard was written by the contemporary <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> Gottfried and Theodoric. Guibert of Gembloux commenced another.
