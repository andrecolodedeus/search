<h1>St. Hippolytus of Rome</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> and <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>; <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; d. about 236. Until the publication in 1851 of the recently discovered "Philosophumena", it was impossible to obtain any definite authentic facts concerning Hippolytus of Rome and his life from the conflicting statements about him, as follows: <ul> <li><a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> says that he was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of a church somewhere and enumerates several of his writings (<a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.20.22</a>). <li>St. Jerome likewise describes him as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of an unknown see, gives a longer list of his writings, and says of one of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> that he delivered it in the presence of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, to whom he made direct reference (<a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 61</a>). <li>The Chronography of 354, in the list of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, mentions Bishop Pontianus and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Hippolytus as being banished to the island of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> in the year 235; the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">Calendar</a> in the same collection records under 13 August the feast of Hippolytus on the Via Tiburtina and Pontianus in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of Callistus (ed. Mommsen in "Mon. Germ. Hist.: auctores antiquissimi", IX, 72, 74). <li>According to the inscription over the grave of Hippolytus composed by Pope Damasus, he was a follower of the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> while a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, but before his death exhorted his followers to become reconciled with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (Ihm, "Damasi epigrammata", Leipzig, 1895, 42, n.37). <li>Prudentius wrote a <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> on the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Hippolytus ("Peristephanon", <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> XI, in P.L., LX, 530 sqq.), in which he places the scene of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> or Porto, and describes Hippolytus as being torn to pieces by wild horses, evidently a reminiscence of the ancient Hippolytus, son of Theseus. <li>Later Greek authors (e.g. <a href="../cathen/06463a.htm">Georgius Syncellus</a>., ed. Bonn, 1829, 674 sqq.; Nicephorus Callistus, "Hist. eccl.", IV, xxxi) do not give much more information than <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> and Jerome; some of them call him <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>, others <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Porto. According to Photius (Bibliotheca, codex 121), he was a disciple of St. Iren&aelig;us. Oriental writers, as well as Pope Gelasius, place the See of Hippolytus at <a href="../cathen/02707a.htm">Bostra</a>, the chief city of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>. <li>Several later legends of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> speak of Hippolytus in various connections. That of St. Laurence refers to him as the officer appointed to guard the blessed <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, who was converted, together with his entire household, and killed by wild horses (Acta SS., August, III, 13-14; <a href="../cathen/14343c.htm">Surius</a>, "De probatis Sanctorum historiis", IV, Cologne, 1573, 581 sqq.). A legend of Porto identifies him with the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Nonnus and gives an account of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> with others of the same city (Acta SS., August, IV, 506; P.G., X, 545-48). <li>A monument of importance is the large fragment of a marble <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> discovered in 1551 which underwent restoration (the upper part of the body and the head being new), and is now preserved in the Lateran museum; the paschal cycle computed by Hippolytus and a list of his writings are engraved on the sides of the chair on which the figure of Hippolytus is seated; the monument dates from the third century (Kraus, "Realencyklop&auml;die der christlichen Altertumer", 661 sqq.). <li>The topographies of the graves of the Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> place the grave of Hippolytus in the cemetery on the Via Tiburtina named after him, mention the basilica erected there, and give some legendary details concerning him. (<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, "Roma sotterranea", I, 178-79); the burial vault of the sainted confessor was unearthed by <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> (Bullettino di archeologia cristiana, 1882, 9-76). </ul>

<p>The discovery of the "Philosophumean" has now made it possible to clear up the most important period of the life of St. Hippolytus through his own evidence, and at the same time to test and correct the conflicting accounts contained in the old authorities. We proceed on the assumption that Hippolytus was really the author of the aforesaid work, an hypothesis almost universally accepted by investigators today.

<p>Hippolytus was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at the beginning of the third century. There is no difficulty in admitting that he could have been a disciple of St. Iren&aelig;us either in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> or Lyons. It is equally possible that <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> heard a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> by Hippolytus when he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> about the year 212. In the reign of <a href="../cathen/15756c.htm">Pope Zephyrinus</a> (198-217) he came into conflict with that pontiff and with the majority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, primarily on account of the christological opinions which for some time had been causing controversies in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Hippolytus had combated the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Theodotion and the <a href="../cathen/01331b.htm">Alogi</a>; in like fashion he opposed the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrines</a> of Noetus, of Epigonus, of Cleomenes, and of Sabellius, who emphasized the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> too one-sidedly (<a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Monarchians</a>) and saw in the concepts of the Father and the Son merely manifestations (<em>modi</em>) of the Divine Nature (Modalism, <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Sabellianism</a>). Hippolytus, on the contrary, stood uncompromisingly for a real difference between the Son (<em>Logos</em>) and the Father, but so as to represent the Former as a Divine Person almost completely separate from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (Ditheism) and at the same time altogether subordinate to the Father (Subordinationism). As the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Modalists was not at first clearly apparent, <a href="../cathen/15756c.htm">Pope Zephyrinus</a> declined to give a decision. For this Hippolytus gravely censured him, representing him as an incompetent man, unworthy to rule the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and as a tool in the hands of the ambitious and intriguing <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Callistus, whose early life is maliciously depicted (Philosophumena, IX, xi-xii). Consequently when Callistus was elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (217-218) on the death of <a href="../cathen/15756c.htm">Zephyrinus</a>, Hippolytus immediately left the communion of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> and had himself elected <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> by his small band of followers. These he calls the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and himself successor to the Apostles, terming the great majority of Roman <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> the School of Callistus. He accuses Callistus of having fallen first into the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Theodotus, then into that of Sabellius; also of having through <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> degraded <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>, and especially the penitential, discipline to a disgraceful laxity. These reproaches were altogether unjustified. Hippolytus himself advocated an excessive rigorism. He continued in opposition as <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> throughout the reigns of the two immediate successors of Callistus, <a href="../cathen/15209a.htm">Urban</a> (222 or 223 to 230) and Pontius (230-35), and during this period, probably during the pontificate of Pontianus, he wrote the "Philosophumena". He was banished to the unhealthful island (<em>insula nociva</em>) of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> at the same time as Pontianus; and shortly before this, or soon afterward, he became reconciled with the legitimate <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. For, after both exiles had died on the island of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, their mortal remains were brought back to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on the same day, 13 August (either 236 or one of the following years), and solemnly <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a>, Pontianus in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> vault in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of Callistus and Hippolytus in a spot on the Via Tiburtina. Both were equally revered as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>: certain <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that Hippolytus had made his peace with that Church before his death. With his death the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> must have come to a speedy end, which accounts for its identification with the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> at the end of the fourth century, as we learn from the inscription by Damasus.

<p>The fact that Hippolytus was a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a> and yet was held in high <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> afterwards both as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, explains why as early as the fourth century nothing was known as to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, for he was not on the list of the Roman <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The theory championed by Lightfoot (see below), that he was actually <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Porto but with his official residence in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, is untenable.

<p>This statement, made by a few authorities, results from a confusion with a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of Porto, due perhaps to a legendary account of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Moreover <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi's</a> hypothesis, based on the inscription by Damasus, that Hippolytus returned from exile, and subsequently became an adherent of <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>, his reconciliation with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> not being effected until just before his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> under the <a href="../cathen/15256b.htm">Emperor Valerian</a> (253-60), is incompatible with the supposition that he is the author of the "Philosophumena." The feast of St. Hippolytus is kept on 13 August, a date assigned in accordance with the legend of St. Laurence; that of Hippolytus of Porto is celebrated on 22 August.

<p>Hippolytus was the most important <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and the most prolific religious writer of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> in the pre-Constantinian era. Nevertheless the fate of his copious literary remains has been unfortunate. Most of his works have been lost or are known only through scattered fragments, while much has survived only in old translations into Oriental and <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> languages; other writings are freely interpolated. The fact that the author wrote in Greek made it inevitable that later, when that language was no longer understood in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the Romans lost interest in his writings, while in the East they were read long after and made the author famous. His works deal with several branches of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, as appears from the aforementioned list on the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, from <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, and from Oriental authors. His <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> treatises were numerous: he wrote commentaries on several books of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a> and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testaments</a>. Most of these are extant only in fragments. The commentary on the Canticle of Canticles, however, has probably been preserved in its entirety ("Werke des Hippolytus", ed. Bonwetsch, 1897, 343 sqq.); likewise the fullest extant commentary on the Book of Daniel in 4 books (ibid., 2 sqq.). Eight of his works, known by their titles, dealt with dogmatic and apologetic subjects, but only one has come down entire in the original Greek. This is the work on Christ and <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> ("De Antichristo", ed. Achelis, op. cit., I, II, 1 sqq.); fragments of a few others have been preserved. Of his polemics against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> the most important is the "Philosophumena", the original title of which is <em>kata pason aireseon elegchos</em> (A Refutation of All Heresies). The first book had long been known; books IV to X, which had been discovered a short time previously, were published in 1851. But the first chapters of the fourth and the whole of the second and third books are still missing. The first four books treat of the Hellenic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>; books V to IX are taken up with the exposition and refutation of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, and the last book contains a recapitulation. The work is one of the most important sources for the history of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> which disturbed the early Church. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> is cited in some <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> as the author of the first book. Photius attributes it to the Roman author Caius, while by others it has been ascribed also to <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>. But most modern scholars hold for weighty reasons that Hippolytus is undoubtedly its author. A shorter treatise agains <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> (Syntagma), and written by Hippolytus at an earlier date, may be restored in outline from later adaptations (Libellus adversus omnes haereses; Epiphanius, "Panarion"; <a href="../cathen/11797a.htm">Philastrius</a>, "De haeresibus"). He wrote a third antiheretical work which was universal in character, called the "Small Labyrinth". Besides these Hippolytus wrote special monographs against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01331b.htm">Alogi</a>, and Caius. Of these writings only a few fragments are extant. Hippolytus also produced an <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> cycle, as well as a chronicle of the world which was made use of by later chroniclers. And finally <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> mentions a work by him on Church <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Three treatises on canon law have been preserved under the name of Hippolytus: the "Constitutiones per Hippolytum" (which are parallel with the eighth book of the Apostolic Constitutions), the <a href="../cathen/05363a.htm">Egyptian Church Ordinance</a>, in Coptic, and the "Canones Hippolyti". Of these works the first two are spurious beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and the last, the authenticity of which was upheld even by Achelis (Die Canones Hippolyti, Leipzig, 1891), belongs in all probability to the fifth or sixth century.

<p>The works of Hippolytus have been edited by <a href="../cathen/05745a.htm">Fabricius</a>, "S. Hippolyti episcopi et mart. opera" (2 vols., Hamburg, 1716-18); by <a href="../cathen/06349c.htm">Gallandi</a> in "Bibliotheca veterum patrum", II, 1766; in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G., X; by Lagarde (Leipzig and London, 1858); and by Bonwetsch and Achelis, "Hippolytus" I, pts. I and II (Leipzig, 1897), in "Die gr. chr. Schriftsteller", a series published by the Berlin Academy. The "Philosophumena" was edited by Miller, as the work of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (Oxford, 1851); by Duncker and Schneidewin as the work of Hippolytus (G&ouml;ttingen, 1859), and in P.G., XVI. The "Canones Hippolyti" were edited by Haneberg (Munich, 1870); by Achelis, "Die altesten Quellen des orientalischen Kirchenrechts", I, in "Texte und Untersuchungen", VI (Leipzig, 1891), 4.
