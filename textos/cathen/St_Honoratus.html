<h1>St. Honoratus</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Arles; b. about 350; d. 6 (or, according to certain authors, 14 or 15) January, 429. There is some disagreement concerning his place of birth, and, as already seen, the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death is also contested. It is believed that he was born in the north of Gaul and that he belonged to an illustrious <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Converted to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> with his brother Venantius, he embarked with him from <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> about 368, under the guidance of a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> named Caprasius, to visit the holy places of Palestine and the <em>laur&aelig;</em> of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. But the death of Venantius, occurring suddenly at Methone, <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaia</a>, prevented the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> travellers from going farther. They returned to Gaul through <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and, after having stopped at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Honoratus went on into Provence and, encouraged by Leontius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06269a.htm">Fr&eacute;jus</a>, took up his abode in the wild island of L&eacute;rins with the intention of living there in solitude. Numerous disciples soon gathered around him and thus was founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, which has enjoyed so great a celebrity and which was during the fifth and sixth centuries a nursery for illustrious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and remarkable <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers. Honoratus's reputation for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> throughout the south-eastern portion of Gaul was such that in 426 after the assassination of Patroclus, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Arles, he was summoned from his solitude to succeed to the government of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> and <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaean</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> had greatly disturbed. He appears to have succeeded in re-establishing order and <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, while still continuing to direct from afar the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of L&eacute;rins. However, the acts of his brief pontificate are not known. He died in the arms of Hilary, one of his disciples and probably a relative, who was to succeed him in the See of Arles. His various writings have not been preserved, nor has the rule which he gave to the solitaries of L&eacute;rins. Cassian, who had visited his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, dedicated to him several of his "Conferences".
