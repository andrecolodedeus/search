<h1>St. Honorius</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, fifth in succession from St. Augustine, elected 627; <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at Lincoln by <a href="../cathen/11585a.htm">St. Paulinus of York</a>, 628; d. 30 Sept., 653 (the last date alone is certain the others are those usually accepted); commemorated, by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Sacred Congregation of Rites (1883) in the Supplement to the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> on 30 Sept. Little is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> about the history of this saint before his elevation, and not much more of his long episcopate. From <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> we gather that he was a Roman <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, a disciple of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, and probably a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>. he either accompanied St. Augustine in 596 or was one of the second band of missionaries sent in 601. As a member of that apostolic company, he must have led that life of fervent <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, which, we are told, had so much effect in converting the inhabitants of Kent. When Honorius's predecessor, Justus, died, Paulinus, fresh from the conversion of Northumbria, was the only <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> left to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> him. From two letter of Pope Honorius I, preserved in <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, it appears that Honorius and his consecrator, in applying to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> from their pallia, asked that, in order to avoid the delays and uncertainties then involved in a journey to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, whenever the occupant of one of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan sees</a> should die, the survivor should have power to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the successor, a request which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> granted. The chief act of Honorius's episcopate was the mission of St. Felix, whom he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and sent to convert the East Angles, an expedition which was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with complete success. He administered his own diocese with great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and energy. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> letter to him shows that his life was spent in the vigorous exercise of the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his office and in the faithful observance of the rule of his master, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>. On the overthrow of the flourishing Kingdom and Church of Northumbria by Cadwalla of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> and Penda of Mercia in 633, he received Paulinus and appointed him to the vacant <a href="../cathen/13102a.htm">See of Rochester</a>. On the death of Paulinus in 644, Honorius <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Ithamar, a native of Kent, as his successor. And some years later, he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of Mercia, Thomas, to succeed Felix in East Anglia, and in or about 652 Beretgils or Boniface, a native of Kent, to succeed Thomas. Next year the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> himself died and was buried with his predecessors in the church of Saints Peter and Paul, founded by Saint Augustine.
