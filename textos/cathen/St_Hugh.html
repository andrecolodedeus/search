<h1>St. Hugh</h1>  

<p>(Called LITTLE SAINT HUGH OF LINCOLN.)

<p>St. Hugh was the son of a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of <a href="../cathen/09266b.htm">Lincoln</a> named Beatrice; born about 1246; died in 1255. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of <a href="../cathen/09266b.htm">Lincoln</a> are said to have crucified him, his body, bearing the marks of crucifixion, being found some days after his death, at the bottom of a well belonging to a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> named Copin. Copin was accused of having enticed the child into his house. A large number of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were gathered together, and they are said to have tortured the child, to have scourged and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> him with thorns, and crucified him in mockery of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death. The story goes on to say that the earth refusing to cover Hugh's body, it was cast into a well. Some time after the child had been missed, his playfellows told his mother how they had seen him follow the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>. On going to Copin's house, she discovered the body. Copin was accused of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, confessed the crime when threatened with death, and stated that it was a Jewish custom to crucify a boy once a year. <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">Miracles</a> were said to have been wrought at the child's <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, and the canons of <a href="../cathen/09266b.htm">Lincoln</a> translated the body from the church of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> to which Hugh belonged, and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> it in great state in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Copin was put to a cruel death and eighteen <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were hanged at <a href="../cathen/09266b.htm">Lincoln</a>, while about ninety were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. These were found guilty and condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>, but they were released on the payment of a large fine.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of St. Hugh became a very popular subject for the ballad poetry of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and we find a reference to it in <a href="../cathen/03642b.htm">Chaucer's</a> "Prioresses Tale". Whether there was any basis of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the accusation against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> there is now no means of ascertaining. There seems to be little <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that such accusations were sometimes made for the purpose of extorting money. A discussion of the question will be found in the article on <a href="../cathen/15635a.htm">St. William of Norwich</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of "Little Hugh" was held on 27 July.
