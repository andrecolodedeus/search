<h1>St. Hugh the Great</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny, born at Semur (Brionnais in the <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Diocese of Autun</a>, 1024; died at Cluny, 28 April, 1109.
<h2>His early life</h2>

<p>The eldest son of Count Dalmatius of Semur and Aremberge (Aremburgis) of Vergy, Hugh was descended from the noblest <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> in <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. Dalmatius, devoted to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and the chase, desired that Hugh should adopt the knightly calling and succeed to the ancestral estates; his mother, however, influenced it is said by a vision vouchsafed to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> whom she consulted, wished her son to dedicate himself to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. From his earliest years Hugh gave indication of such extraordinary earnestness and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> that his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, recognizing his evident aversion from the so-called gentle pursuits, entrusted him to his grand-uncle Hugh, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Auxerre, for preparation for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Under the protection of this relative, Hugh received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> attached to the Priory of St. Marcellus. At the age of fourteen he entered the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at Cluny, where he displayed such <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">religious fervour</a> that he was allowed to make his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> in the following year without completing the severe <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> usual at this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The special privilege of the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> Congregation enabled him to become <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> at eighteen and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at twenty. In recognition of his wonderful <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the discipline of the order, and of the confidence awakened by his conspicuous talent for government, he was quickly, in spite of his youth, chosen grand prior. In this capacity he was charged with the whole domestic direction of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> in both spiritual and temporal affairs, and represented the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> during his absence (Cfr. D'Achery, "Spicilegium", 2nd ed., I, 686). On the death of <a href="../cathen/11207c.htm">St. Odilo</a> on 1 January, 1049, after a prolonged administration of nigh on half a century, Hugh was unanimously elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> installed by Archbishop Hugh of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a> on the Feast of the Chair of Peter at Antioch (22 February), 1049.
<h2>Hugh as abbot</h2>

<p>Hugh's character bears many points of resemblance to that of his great contemporary and friend, <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">St. Gregory VII</a>. Both were animated with a burning <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> to extirpate the abuses then prevalent among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, to crush investiture with its corollaries, <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> incontinence, and to rescue <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> from the confusion into which the reckless <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> and <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> of rulers and the consequent political instability had thrown it. The emperor claimed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to appoint <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, even the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself (see <a href="../cathen/08084c.htm">CONFLICT OF INVESTITURES</a>), and in too many cases his selection was swayed entirely by political motives to the exclusion of every thought of religious fitness. To prevent the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from lapsing into a mere appanage of the State and to re-establish <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> were the great objects alike of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> and Hugh, and if, in certain cases, <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> allowed his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> to outstrip his discretion, he found in Hugh an unflinching ally, and to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>, particularly the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> branch, belongs the chief credit of <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgating</a> among the people and carrying into effect in Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> the many salutary reforms emanating from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In founding Cluny in 910, and endowing it with his entire domains, William the Pious of Aquitaine had placed it under the direct protection of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Thus Cluny, with its network of daughter-foundations (see Cluny, Congregation of; Gallia Christ., II, 374), was a formidable weapon for reform in the hands of the successive <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. Hugh entrusted the election of the superiors of all <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> and churches subject to him into spiritual hands, promised them &#151; in addition to the privileges of the congregation &#151; the support and protection of Cluny, and thus saved hundreds of <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> from the cupidity of secular lords, who were very loath to interfere with the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of a congregation so powerful and enjoying such high favour with emperors and kings. To secure this protection numbers of <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> became affiliated with Cluny; new houses were opened in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, while under Hugh was also founded at St. Pancras near Lewes the first <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> house in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. (See, however, <a href="../cathen/02081a.htm">ST. AUGUSTINE OF CANTERBURY</a>; <a href="../cathen/05199a.htm">ST. DUNSTAN</a>.) Since the superiors of most of these homes were either directly or indirectly nominated by Hugh, and since, as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, he had to ratify the elections, it is easy to understand how important a role he played in the great struggle between imperialism and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>As early as 1049, at the age of twenty-five, Hugh appeared at the Council of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. Here, at the request, and in the presence of <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a>, he expressed so energetically against the reigning abuses that even the <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> could not withstand his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. This advocacy contributed largely to the passing of many remedial ordinances concerning church discipline (cfr. Labbe, "Conc.", IX, 1045-6), and led <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> to take Hugh with him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> that he might have the assistance and advice of the young <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> at the great council to be held in 1050, at which the question of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> discipline was to be decided and the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a> condemned (cfr. Hefele, "Conciliengesch.", IV, 741). Leo's successor, Victor II, also held Hugh in the highest esteem, and confirmed in 1055 all the privileges of Cluny. On <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand's</a> arrival in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> (1054), he hastened first to Cluny to consult with Hugh and secure his assistance at the Council of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>. <a href="../cathen/14290c.htm">Stephen IX</a>, immediately on his elevation, summoned Hugh to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, made him the companion of his journeys, and finally died in his arms at Florence (1058). Hugh was also the companion of <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a>, and under him took part in the Council of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> which <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the important <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> concerning papal elections (<a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1059). He was then sent to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> with Cardinal Stephan, a Monk of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, to effect the execution of the decrees of the Roman synod, and proceeded to Aquitaine, while his colleague repaired to the northwest. The active support of the numerous <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> subject to Cluny enabled him to discharge his mission with the greatest success. He assembled councils at <a href="../cathen/02159a.htm">Avignon</a> and Vienne, and managed to win the support of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for many important reforms. In the same year (10) he presided over the Synod of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. At the Council of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1063 he defended the privileges of Cluny which had been recklessly attacked in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a> sent <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a>, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to adjudicate in this and other matters, meanwhile ratifying all the privileges held by Hugh's predecessors. After a stay at Cluny, during which he conceived the high admiration and veneration for the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> reflected in his letters (cfr. "Epist.", VI, 2, 4, 5 in P.L., XCLIV, 378), the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> held a council at <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a>, which decided in favour of Hugh.



<p>Scarcely had <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a> ascended the Chair of Peter as <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> when he wrote to Cluny to secure Hugh's cooperation in promoting his various reforms. Hugh was entrusted to deal with the delicate case of the unworthy Archbishop Manasse of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, as well as with commissions in connection with the expedition of Count Evroul of Roucy against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Frequently urged by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> to come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Hugh was unable to leave <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> until after the lamentable occurrences of 1076 (see GREGORY VII), but then hastened to visit the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at <a href="../cathen/03298a.htm">Canossa</a>. With the assistance of Countess Mathilda, he managed to bring about the reconciliation &#151; unfortunately of short duration &#151; between <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> and Henry IV, who had already addressed a letter full of affection declaring his great desire for the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (cfr. "Hist. Lit. de la France", loc. cit. infra). Hugh was subsequently engaged with the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in the matter of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform, and, as a result of his diligence and the high favour he enjoyed with Alphonsus VI of Castille, the Mozarabic was replaced by the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a> throughout that monarch's realm. Thanks to the assistance of the many <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> foundations in <a href="../cathen/03428a.htm">Catalonia</a>, Castille, <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>, <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, etc., and the many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> chosen from their inmates, he was also enabled to give a great impetus to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform in these countries. In 1077 he was commissioned to presides over the Council of <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>, and later to undertake the removal of he <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>. <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> wrote him many affectionate letters, and at the Roman synod in 1081 referred to Hugh in terms of praise seldom used by a successor of Peter concerning a living <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. That this appreciation was not confined to the Holy Father is evident from the fact that, when asked by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> whether his opinion was shared by them, all present answered: "Placet, laudamus" (Bullar. Clun., p. 21).

<p>On the revival of the quarrel between Henry IV and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, Hugh set out immediately for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but was seized on the way and conducted before the monarch. So earnestly did he urge Henry to make his submission to Peter's successor that he seemed again to have bridged the quarrel, if this were not another example of the king's well-known duplicity. It is scarcely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to state that Hugo's intimacy with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> continued unchanged under <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> and Paschal II, since both issued from the ranks of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, Surrounded by <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 25 October, 1095, the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of the new church at Cluny, and granted the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> new privileges, which were augmented by Paschal during his visit in 1107. At the great Council of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> in 1095, whose decision to organize the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section1">First Crusade</a> was a clear indication of the great religious enthusiasm resulting from <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory's</a> and Hugh's labours, the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> performed most valuable services in the composition and <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the decrees, for which he was specially thanked by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Until the death, in 1106, of Henry IV, who in that year addressed two letters to his ":dearest father", begging for his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and his intercession with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (cfr. "Hist. Lit. de la France", loc. cit. infra), Hugh never relaxed his efforts to bring about a reconciliation between the spiritual and temporal powers.

<p>In the spring of 1109, Hugh, worn out with years and labours, and feeling his end approaching, asked for the Last Sacraments, summoned around him his spiritual children, and, having given each the <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a>, dismissed them with the greeting: <em>Benedicite.</em> Then, asking to be conveyed to the Chapel of our Blessed Lady, he laid himself in sackcloth and ashes before her altar, and thus breathed forth his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to his Creator on the evening of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Monday (28 April). His <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> in the church was soon the scene of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and to it Pope Gelasius I made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> in 1119, dying at Cluny on 20 January. Elected at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on 2 February, <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a> began immediately the process of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>, and, on 6 January, 1120, declared Hugh a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, appointing 29 April his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast-day</a>. In <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/07515b.htm">St. Hugh</a> the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny was henceforth accorded the title and dignity of a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. At the instance of <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> the translation of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> remains took place on 23 May, 1220, but, during the uprising of the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> (1575), the remains and the costly shrine disappeared with the exception of a few <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>.
<h2>Hugh's personality and influence</h2>

<p>In the case of comparatively few of our <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> has the decision of their own and subsequent ages been so unanimous as in that of <a href="../cathen/07515b.htm">St. Hugh</a>. Living in an age of misrepresentation and abuse, when the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had to contend with far grater domestic and external inimical forces than those marshalled by the so-called <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, not a single voice was raised against his character &#151; for we disregard the criticism of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who in the heat of a quarrel pronounced hasty words afterwards to be recalled, and who was subsequently one of Hugh's panegyrists. In one of his letters <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> declares that he confidently expects the success of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy and the instrumentality of Hugh, "whom no imprecation, no applause or favours, no personal motives can divert from the path of rectitude" (Gregorii VII Registr., IV, 22). In the "Life of Bishop Arnulf of <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>", Arnulf says of Hugh: "Most pure in though and deed, he as the promoter and perfect guardian of monastic discipline and the regular life, the unfailing support of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religious and of men of probity, the vigorous champion and defender of the Holy Church" (Mabillon, op. cit. infra, saec. VI, pars II, P. 532). And of his closing years Bishop Bruno of <a href="../cathen/13683b.htm">Segni</a> writes: "Now aged and burdened with years, reverenced by all and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> by all, he still governs that venerable <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> [sc. Cluny] with the same consummate wisdom &#151; a man in all things most laudable, difficult of comparison, and of wonderful <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>" (Muratori, "Rerum Ital. script.", III, pt. ii, 347).

<p>Emperors and kings vied with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiffs</a> in bestowing on Hugh marks of their veneration and esteem. Henry the Black, in a letter which has come down to us, addresses Hugh as his "very dear father, worthy of every respect", declares that he owes his own return to health and the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> birth of his child to the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot's</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and urges him to come to the Court at Cologne the following <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> to stand sponsor for this son (the future Henry IV). During her <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowhood</a> Empress Agnes wrote to Hugh in terms no less respectful and affectionate, asking him to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> repose of her husband's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and for the prosperous reign of her son. Reference has been already made to the letters sent to Hugh by Henry IV, who, notwithstanding his prolonged struggle to make the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> subservient to the imperial power, seems never to have lost his affection and profound respect for his saintly godfather. In recognition of the benefits derived from the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> foundations, Ferdinand the Great of Castille and Leon (d. 1065) made his kingdom tributary to Cluny; his sons Sancho and Alfonso VI doubled the tribute, and the latter, in addition to introducing the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a> at Hugh's request, carried on a most affectionate correspondence with the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. In 1081 Hugh was chosen by the kings and princes of the various <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> kingdoms of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> as arbiter to decide the question of succession. When Robert II of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> refused to attend the Council of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a> (1065), at which his presence was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, Hugo was sent to summon the duke, and remonstrated with him so eloquently in the interests of peace that Robert accompanied the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> unresistingly to the council, became reconciled with those who had put his son to death, and promised to respect thenceforth the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a>.

<p>William the Conqueror of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, shortly after the Battle of Hastings (1066), made rich presents to Cluny and begged to be admitted a <em>confrater</em> of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> like the Spanish kings. He subsequently begged Hugh to send six <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to minister to the spiritual needs of the Court, and renewed his request in 1078, promising to appoint twelve of the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> Congregation to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> and abbacies within the kingdom. Hugh disabused his mind on the subject of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> appointments, and, when founding a little later the Priorate of St. Pancras at Lewes, took every precaution to secure in the case of it and its dependent <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> freedom of election and respect for canon law. How <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> this precaution was, the Investiture <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, which broke out under William's sons, clearly indicated. The champion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in this struggle, <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm of Canterbury</a>, was one of the many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who consulted Hugh in their difficulties and trials, and on three occasions &#151; once during his exile from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> &#151; visited the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> at Cluny.

<p>For the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> under is care Hugh was a model of fatherly forethought, of devotion to discipline and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and unhesitating obedience to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In furtherance of the great objects of his order, the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and personal sanctification, he strove to impart the utmost possible splendour and solemnity to the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> services at Cluny. Some of his <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> ordinances, such as the singing of the Veni Creator at Tierce on Pentecost Sunday (subsequently also within the octave), have since been extended to the entire <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. He began the magnificent church at Cluny &#151; now unfortunately entirely disappeared &#151; which was, until the erection of St. Peter's at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the largest church in <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, and was esteemed the finest example of the Romanesque style in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. For the part played by Cluny in the evolution of this style and for its special <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, the reader must be referred to treatises on the history of architecture. Hugh gave the first impulse to the introduction of the strict <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> into the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, prescribing it first for that of Marcigny, of which his sister became first <a href="../cathen/12428a.htm">prioress</a> in 1061 (Cucherat, op. cit. infra), and where his mother also took the veil. Renowned for his charity towards the suffering poor, he built a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, where he himself performed the most menial <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. It is impossible to trace here the effect which his granting of personal and civic freedom to the bondsmen and colonists feudatory to Cluny, and the fostering of tradesmen's guilds &#151; the nuclei from which most of the modern cities of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> sprang &#151; have had on civilization.

<p>Although his favourite study was the Scriptures, <a href="../cathen/07515b.htm">St. Hugh</a> encouraged <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> in every possible way, and showed his deep interest in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> by teaching in person in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> attached to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Notwithstanding the exceeding activity of his life he found time to carry on an extensive correspondence. Almost all his letters and his "Life of the Blessed Virgin", for whom as well as for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> he had a great devotion, have been lost. However, his extant letters and his "Sermo" in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> Saint Marcellus are sufficient to show "how well he could write and with what skill he could speak to the heart" (Hist. Lit. de la <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, IX, 479).
