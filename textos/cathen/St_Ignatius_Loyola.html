<div id="springfield2">
<h1>St. Ignatius Loyola</h1>  

<p>Youngest son of Don Beltr&aacute;n Ya&ntilde;ez de O&ntilde;ez y Loyola and Marina Saenz de Lieona y Balda (the name L&oacute;pez de Recalde, though accepted by the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandist</a> Father Pien, is a copyist's blunder).

<p>Born in 1491 at the castle of Loyola above Azpeitia in Guipuscoa; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 31 July, 1556. The <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> arms are: per pale, or, seven bends gules (?vert) for O&ntilde;ez; argent, pot and chain sable between two grey wolves rampant, for Loyola. The saint was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> I&ntilde;igo, after St. Enecus (Innicus), <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of O&ntilde;a: the name Ignatius was assumed in later years, while he was residing in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> genealogy, see P&eacute;rez (op. cit. below, 131); Michel (op. cit. below, II, 383); Polanco (Chronicon, I, 51646). For the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth cfr. Astr&aacute;in, I, 3 S.
<h2 id="section1">Conversion (1491-1521)</h2>

<p>At an early age he was made a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>. We do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> when, or why he was released from <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>. He was brought up in the household of Juan Vel&aacute;squez de Cuellar, <em>contador mayor</em> to Ferdinand and <a href="../cathen/08177a.htm">Isabella</a>, and in his suite probably attended the court from time to time, though not in the royal service. This was perhaps the time of his greatest dissipation and laxity. He was affected and extravagant about his hair and dress, consumed with the desire of winning <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and would seem to have been sometimes involved in those darker intrigues, for which handsome young courtiers too often think themselves licensed. How far he went on the downward course is still unproved. The balance of evidence tends to show that his own subsequent <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> confessions of having been a great sinner should not be treated as <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> exaggerations. But we have no details, not even definite charges. In 1517 a change for the better seems to have taken place; Vel&aacute;squez died and Ignatius took service in the army. The turning-point of his life came in 1521. While the French were besieging the citadel of <a href="../cathen/11437a.htm">Pampeluna</a>, a cannon ball, passing between Ignatius' legs, tore open the left calf and broke the right shin (Whit-Tuesday, 20 May, 1521). With his fall the garrison lost heart and surrendered, but he was well treated by the French and carried on a litter to Loyola, where his leg had to be rebroken and reset, and afterwards a protruding end of the bone was sawn off, and the limb, having been shortened by clumsy setting, was stretched out by weights. All these pains were undergone <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>, without uttering a cry or submitting to be bound. But the pain and weakness which followed were so great that the patient began to fail and sink. On the <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">eve</a> of Sts. Peter and Paul, however, a turn for the better took place, and he threw off his fever.

<p>So far Ignatius had shown none but the ordinary virtues of the Spanish officer. His dangers and sufferings has doubtless done much to purge his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but there was no <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> yet of remodelling his life on any higher ideals. Then, in order to divert the weary hours of convalescence, he asked for the romances of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">chivalry</a>, his favourite reading, but there were none in the castle, and instead they brought him the lives of Christ and of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and he read them in the same quasi-competitive spirit with which he read the achievements of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> and warriors. "Suppose I were to rival this saint in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, that one in endurance, that other in <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>." He would then wander off into thoughts of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">chivalry</a>, and service to fair ladies, especially to one of high rank, whose name is unknown. Then all of a sudden, he became <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">conscious</a> that the after-effect of these dreams was to make him dry and dissatisfied, while the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of falling into rank among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> braced and strengthened him, and left him full of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and peace. Next it dawned on him that the former <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> were of the world, the latter God-sent; finally, worldly thoughts began to lose their hold, while <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a> ones grew clearer and dearer. One night as he lay awake, pondering these new lights, "he saw clearly", so says his autobiography, "the image of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> with the Holy Child <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>", at whose sight for a notable <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> he felt a reassuring sweetness, which eventually left him with such a loathing of his past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and especially for those of the flesh, that every unclean <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> seemed blotted out from his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and never again was there the least <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> to any carnal thought. His <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> was now complete. Everyone noticed that he would speak of nothing but spiritual things, and his elder brother begged him not to take any rash or extreme resolution, which might compromise the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>.
<h2 id="section2">Spiritual formation (1522-24)</h2>

<p>When Ignatius left Loyola he had no definite plans for the future, except that he wished to rival all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> had done in the way of <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>. His first care was to make a general confession at the famous sanctuary of Montserrat, where, after three days of self-examination, and carefully noting his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, he <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessed</a>, gave to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> the rich clothes in which he had come, and put on garment of sack-cloth reaching to his feet. His sword and dagger he suspended at <a href="../cathen/01355b.htm">Our Lady's altar</a>, and passed the night watching before them. Next morning, the <a href="../cathen/01542a.htm">feast of the Annunciation</a>, 1522, after <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Communion</a>, he left the sanctuary, not knowing whither he went. But he soon fell in with a kind <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, I&ntilde;es Pascual, who showed him a cavern near the neighbouring town of Manresa, where he might retire for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">austerities</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, while he lived on <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. But here, instead of obtaining greater peace, he was consumed with the most troublesome <a href="../cathen/13640a.htm">scruples</a>. Had he <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessed</a> this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? Had he omitted that circumstance? At one time he was <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempted</a> to end his miseries by <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a>, on which he resolved neither to eat nor to drink (unless his life was in danger), until <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> granted him the peace which he desired, and so he continued until his confessor stopped him at the end of the week. At last, however, he triumphed over all obstacles, and then abounded in wonderful <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> and <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a>.



<p>It was at this time, too, that he began to make notes of his spiritual experiences, notes which grew into the little book of <a href="../cathen/14224b.htm">"The Spiritual Exercises"</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> also afflicted him with severe sicknesses, when he was looked after by friends in the public <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>; for many felt drawn towards him, and he requited their many kind offices by teaching them how to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and instructing them in spiritual matters. Having recovered health, and acquired sufficient experience to guide him in his new life, he commenced his long-meditated migration to the Holy Land. From the first he had looked forward to it as leading to a life of heroic penance; now he also regarded it as a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in which he might learn how to realize clearly and to conform himself perfectly to <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">Christ's life</a>. The voyage was fully as painful as he had conceived. <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">Poverty</a>, sickness, exposure, fatigue, starvation, dangers of shipwreck and capture, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a>, blows, contradictions, these were his daily lot; and on his arrival the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, who had charge of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places, commanded him to return under pain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Ignatius demanded what <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> they had thus to interfere with a pilgrim like himself, and the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> explained that, to prevent many troubles which had occurred in finding ransoms for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had given them the power and they offered to show him their <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>. Ignatius at once submitted, though it meant altering his whole plan of life, refused to look at the proferred <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>, and was back at <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona</a> about March, 1524.
<h2 id="section3">Studies and companions (1521-39)</h2>

<p>Ignatius left <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in the dark as to his future and "asking himself as he went, <em>quid agendum</em>" (Autobiography, 50). Eventually he resolved to study, in order to be of greater help to others. To studies he therefore gave eleven years, more than a third of his remaining life. Later he studied among school-boys at <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, and early in 1526 he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> enough to proceed to his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at the <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">University of Alcal&aacute;</a>. But here he met with many troubles to be described later, and at the end of 1527 he entered the <a href="../cathen/13392a.htm">University of Salamanca</a>, whence, his trials continuing, he betook himself to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (June, 1528), and there with great method repeated his course of arts, taking his M.A. on 14 March, 1535. Meanwhile <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> had been begun, and he had taken the licentiate in 1534; the doctorate he never took, as his health compelled him to leave <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in March, 1535. Though Ignatius, despite his pains, acquired no great erudition, he gained many practical advantages from his course of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. To say nothing of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> sufficient to find such information as he needed afterwards to hold his own in the company of the learned, and to control others more erudite than himself, he also became thoroughly versed in the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and learned by experience how the life of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and penance might be combined with that of teaching and study, an invaluable acquirement to the future founder of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. The labours of Ignatius for others involved him in trials without number. At Barcelona, he was beaten senseless, and his companion <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killed</a>, at the instigation of some worldlings vexed at being refused entrance into a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> which he had reformed. At Alcal&aacute;, a meddlesome <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">inquisitor</a>, Figueroa, harassed him constantly, and once automatically <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> him for two months. This drove him to Salamanca, where, worse still, he was thrown into the common <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, fettered by the foot to his companion Calisto, which indignity only drew from Ignatius the characteristic words, "There are not so many handcuffs and chains in Salamanca, but that I desire even more for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p>In <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> his trials were very varied &#151; from poverty, plague, <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>, and college discipline, on which account he was once <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentenced</a> to a public flogging by Dr. Govea, the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of Coll&egrave;ge Ste-Barbe, but on his explaining his conduct, the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> as publicly begged his pardon. There was but one delation to the inquisitors, and, on Ignatius requesting a prompt settlement, the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisitor</a> <a href="../cathen/11333a.htm">Ori</a> told him proceedings were therewith quashed.

<p>We notice a certain progression in Ignatius' dealing with accusations against him. The first time he allowed them to cease without any pronouncement being given in his favour. The second time he demurred at Figueroa wanting to end in this fashion. The third time, after <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentence</a> had been passed, he <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appealed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo against some of its clauses. Finally he does not await <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentence</a>, but goes at once to the judge to urge an inquiry, and eventually he made it his practice to demand <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentence</a>, whenever reflection was cast upon his <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. (Records of Ignatius' legal proceedings at Azpeitia, in 1515; at <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">Alcal&acute;</a> in 1526, 1527; at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1537; at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1538, will be found in "Scripta de S. Ignatio", pp. 580-620.) Ignatius had now for the third time gathered companions around him. His first followers in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> had persevered for a time, even amid the severe trials of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, but instead of following Ignatius to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, as they had agreed to do, they gave him up. In <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> too the first to follow did not persevere long, but of the third band not one deserted him. They were <a href="../cathen/11767a.htm">(St.) Peter Faber</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Genevan</a> <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoyard</a>; <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">(St.) Francis Xavier</a>, of <a href="../cathen/10721a.htm">Navarre</a>; <a href="../cathen/08747a.htm">James Laynez</a>, <a href="../cathen/13402b.htm">Alonso Salmer&oacute;n</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02605a.htm">Nicol&aacute;s Bobadilla</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>; Sim&oacute;n Rodr&iacute;guez, a <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a>. Three others joined soon after &#151; Claude Le Jay, a <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Genevan</a> <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoyard</a>; Jean Codure and Paschase Bro&euml;t, French. Progress is to be noted in the way Ignatius trained his companions. The first were exercised in the same severe exterior <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortifications</a>, begging, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, going barefoot, etc., which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was himself practising. But though this <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> had prospered in a quiet country place like Manresa, it had attracted an objectionable amount of criticism at the <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">University of Alcal&aacute;</a>. At <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> dress and habits were adapted to the life in great towns; <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, etc., was reduced; studies and spiritual exercises were multiplied, and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> funded.

<p>The only bond between Ignatius' followers so far was devotion to himself, and his great ideal of leading in the Holy Land a life as like as possible to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a>. On 15 August, 1534, they took the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of poverty and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> at Montmartre (probably near the modern Chapelle de St-Denys, Rue Antoinette), and a third <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to go to the Holy Land after two years, when their studies were finished. Six months later Ignatius was compelled by bad health to return to his native country, and on recovery made his way slowly to Bologna, where, unable through ill health to study, he devoted himself to active <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a> till his companions came from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> (6 January, 1537) on the way to the Holy Land. Finding further progress barred by the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, they now agreed to await for a year the opportunity of fulfilling their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, after which they would put themselves at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> disposal. Faber and some others, going to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, got leave for all to be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>. They were eventually made <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> on St. John Baptist's day. But Ignatius took eighteen months to prepare for his first Mass.
<h2 id="section4">Foundation of the society</h2>

<p>By the winter of 1537, the year of waiting being over, it was time to offer their services to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The others being sent in pairs to neighboring <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> towns, Ignatius with Faber and Laynez started for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. At La Storta, a few miles before reaching the city, Ignatius had a noteworthy <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a>. He seemed to see the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal Father</a> associating him with His Son, who spoke the words: <em>Ego vobis Romae propitius ero</em>. Many have thought this promise simply referred to the subsequent success of the order there. Ignatius' own interpretation was characteristic: "I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether we shall be crucified in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> will be propitious." Just before or just after this, Ignatius had suggested for the title of their brotherhood "The Company of Jesus". <em>Company</em> was taken in its military sense, and in those days a company was generally known by its captain's name. In the Latin <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of foundation, however, they were called "Societas Jesu". We first hear of the term <em>Jesuit</em> in 1544, applied as a term of reproach by adversaries. It had been used in the fifteenth century to describe in scorn someone who cantingly interlarded his speech with repetitions of the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">Holy Name</a>. In 1522 it was still regarded as a mark of scorn, but before very long the friends of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">society</a> saw that they could take it in a good sense, and, though never used by Ignatius, it was readily adopted (Pollen, "The Month", June, 1909). <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> having received the fathers favourably, all were summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to work under the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> eyes. At this critical moment an active campaign of <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> was opened by one Fra Matteo Mainardi (who eventually died in open <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>), and a certain Michael who had been refused admission to the order. It was not till 18 November, 1538, that Ignatius obtained from the governor of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentence</a>, still extent, in his favour. The thoughts of the fathers were naturally occupied with a formula of their intended mode of life to submit to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; and in March, 1539, they began to meet in the evenings to settle the matter.

<p>Hitherto without superior, rule or tradition, they had prospered most remarkably. Why not continue as they had begun? The obvious answer was that without some sort of union, some houses for training <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a>, they were practically doomed to die out with the existing members, for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> already desired to send them about as missioners from place to place. This point was soon agreed to, but when the question arose whether they should, by adding a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of obedience to their existing <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, form themselves into a compact <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, or remain, as they were, a congregation of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, opinions differed much and seriously. Not only had they done so well without strict rules, but (to mention only one obstacle, which was in fact not overcome afterwards without great difficulty), there was the danger, if they decided for an order, that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> might force them to adopt some ancient rule, which would mean the end of all their new <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. The debate on this point continued for several weeks, but the conclusion in favour of a life under obedience was eventually reached unanimously. After this, progress was faster, and by 24 June some sixteen resolutions had been decided on, covering the main points of the proposed institute. Thence Ignatius drew up in five sections the first "Formula Instituti", which was submitted to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who gave a viva voce <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> 3 September, 1539, but Cardinal Guidiccioni, the head of the commission appointed to report on the "Formula", was of the view that a new order should not be admitted, and with that the chances of <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> seemed to be at an end. Ignatius and his companions, undismayed, agreed to offer up 4000 Masses to obtain the object desired, and after some <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> unexpectedly changed his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, approved the "Formula" and the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Regimini militantis Ecclesiae" (27 September, 1540), which embodies and <a href="../cathen/13428a.htm">sanctions</a> it, was issued, but the members were not to exceed sixty (this clause was abrogated after two years). In April, 1541, Ignatius was, in spite of his reluctance, elected the first general, and on 22 April he and his companions made their profession in <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">St. Paul Outside the Walls</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">society</a> was now fully constituted.
<h2 id="section5">The book of the spiritual exercises</h2>

<p>This work originated in Ignatius' experiences, while he was at Loyola in 1521, and the chief <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">meditations</a> were probably reduced to their present shapes during his life at Manresa in 1522, at the end of which period he had begun to teach them to others. In the process of 1527 at Salamanca, they are spoken of for the first time as the "Book of Exercises". The earliest extant text is of the year 1541. At the request of <a href="../cathen/06213a.htm">St. Francis Borgia</a>. The book was examined by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/03519d.htm">censors</a> and a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> given by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Pastoralis Officii" of 1548. <a href="../cathen/14224b.htm">"The Spiritual Exercises"</a> are written very concisely, in the form of a handbook for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who is to explain them, and it is practically impossible to describe them without making them, just as it might be impossible to explain Nelson's "Sailing Orders" to a man who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing of ships or the sea. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the work is to help the exercitant to find out what the will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in regard to his future, and to give him energy and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to follow that will. The exercitant (under ideal circumstances) is guided through four weeks of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">meditations</a>: the first week on <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and its consequences, the second on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's life on earth</a>, the third on his passion, the fourth on His risen life; and a certain number of instructions (called "rules", "additions", "notes") are added to teach him how to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, how to avoid <a href="../cathen/13640a.htm">scruples</a>, how to elect a <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">vocation</a> in life without being swayed by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of self or of the world. In their fullness they should, according to Ignatius' <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, ordinarily be made once or twice only; but in part (from three to four days) they may be most profitably made annually, and are now commonly called "retreats", from the seclusion or retreat from the world in which the exercitant lives. More popular selections are preached to the people in church and are called "missions". The stores of spiritual wisdom contained in the "Book of Exercises" are truly astonishing, and their author is believed to have been inspired while drawing them up. (See also next section.) Sommervogel enumerates 292 writers among the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> alone, who have commented on the whole book, to say nothing of commentators on parts (e.g. the meditations), who are far more numerous still. But the best testimony to the work is the frequency with which the exercises are made. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (for which alone statistics are before the writer) the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> people who make <a href="../cathen/12795b.htm">retreats</a> number annually about 22,000, while the number who attend popular expositions of the Exercises in "missions" is approximately 27,000, out of a total <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 2,000,000.
<h2 id="section6">The constitutions of the society</h2>

<p>Ignatius was commissioned in 1541 to draw them up, but he did not begin to do so until 1547, having occupied the mean space with introducing customs tentatively, which were destined in time to become <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. In 1547 Father Polanco became his secretary, and with his intelligent aid the first draft of the constitutions was made between 1547 and 1550, and simultaneously <a href="../cathen/12231b.htm">pontifical</a> <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> was asked for a new edition of the "Formula". <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a> conceded this by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Exposcit debitum", 21 July, 1550. At the same time a large number of the older fathers assembled to peruse the first draft of the constitutions, and though none of them made any serious objections, Ignatius' next recension (1552) shows a fair amount of changes. This revised version was then published and put into force throughout the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">society</a>, a few explanations being added here and there to meet difficulties as they arose. These final touches were being added by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> up till the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of his death, after which the first general congregation of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">society</a> ordered them to be printed, and they have never been touched since. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> way of appreciating the constitutions of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">society</a> is to study them as they are carried into practice by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> themselves, and for this, reference may be made to the articles on the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">S<font size=-2>OCIETY OF</font> J<font size=-2>ESUS</font></a>. A few points, however, in which Ignatius' institute differed from the older orders may be mentioned here. They are:

<ol><li>the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> not to accept <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignities</a>; <li>increased probations. The <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> is prolonged from one year to two, with a third year, which usually falls after the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Candidates are moreover at first admitted to simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> only, <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> coming much later on; <li>the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> does not keep choir; <li>it does not have a distinctive religious habit; <li>it does not accept the direction of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>; <li>it is not governed by a regular triennial chapter; <li>it is also said to have been the first order to undertake <em>officially</em> and <em>by virtue of its <a href="../cathen/04320a.htm">constitutions</a></em> active works such as the following:<ul><li>foreign missions, at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> bidding; <li>the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth of all classes; <li>the instruction of the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>; <li>ministering to the sick, to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>, etc. </ul></ol>

<p>The above points give no conception of the originality with which Ignatius has handled all parts of his subject, even those common to all orders. It is obvious that he must have acquired some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of other religious constitutions, especially during the years of inquiry (1541-1547), when he was on terms of intimacy with religious of every class. But <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>, who attended him, tell us that he wrote without any books before him except the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. Though his constitutions of course embody technical terms to be found in other rules, and also a few stock phrases like "the old man's staff", and "the corpse carried to any place", the thought is entirely original, and would seem to have been God-guided throughout. By a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> accident we still possess his journal of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for forty days, during which he was deliberating the single point of poverty in churches. It shows that in making up his mind he was marvelously aided by heavenly lights, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a>. If, as we may surely infer, the whole work was equally assisted by grace, its heavenly inspiration will not be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. The same conclusion is probable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of "The Spiritual".
<h2 id="section7">Later life and death</h2>

<p>The later years of Ignatius were spent in partial retirement, the correspondence inevitable in governing the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> leaving no <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> for those works of active ministry which in themselves he much preferred. His health too began to fail. In 1551, when he had gathered the elder fathers to revise the constitutions, he laid his resignation of the generalate in their hands, but they refused to accept it then or later, when the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> renewed his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. In 1554 Father Nadal was given the powers of <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, but it was often <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to send him abroad as commissary, and in the end Ignatius continued, with Polanco's aid, to direct everything. With most of his first companions he had to part soon. Rodr&iacute;guez started on 5 March, 1540, for <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, where he eventually founded the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> province, of which he was made provincial on 10 October, 1546. <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> followed Rodr&iacute;guez immediately, and became <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> in 1549. In September, 1541, <a href="../cathen/13402b.htm">Salmeron</a> and Broet started for their perilous mission to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, which they reached (via <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>) next <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, the prey to <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII's</a> barbarous <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, could not give the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> missionaries a free field for the exercise of the ministries proper to their institute. All <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> they passed in Ulster, flying from <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a>, and doing in secret such good as they might. With difficulty they reached <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and regained <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Dec., 1542. The beginnings of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> are connected with <a href="../cathen/11767a.htm">St. Peter Faber</a>, <a href="../cathen/11756c.htm">Blessed Peter Canisius</a>, Le Jay, and <a href="../cathen/02605a.htm">Bobadilla</a> in 1542. In 1546 Laynez and <a href="../cathen/13402b.htm">Salmeron</a> were <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nominated</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, where Canisius, Le Jay, and Covillon also found places. In 1553 came the picturesque, but not very successful mission of Nu&ntilde;ez Barretto as <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>. For all these missions Ignatius wrote minute instructions, many of which are still extant. He encouraged and exhorted his envoys in their work by his letters, while the reports they wrote back to him form our chief source of information on the missionary triumphs achieved. Though living alone in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, it was he who in effect led, directed, and animated his subjects all the world over.

<p>The two most painful crosses of this period were probably the suits with Isabel Roser and Sim&oacute;n Rodr&iacute;guez. The former lady had been one of Ignatius' first and most esteemed patronesses during his beginnings in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. She came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> later on and persuaded Ignatius to receive a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of obedience to him, and she was afterwards joined by two or three other ladies. But the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> found that the demands they made on his <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> were more than he could possibly allow them. "They <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> me more trouble", he is reported to have said, "than the whole of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>", and he obtained from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a relaxation of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> he had accepted. A suit with Roser followed, which she lost, and Ignatius forbade his sons hereafter to become <em>ex officio</em> directors to <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> (Scripta de S. Ignatio, pp. 652-5). Painful though this must have been to a man so loyal as Ignatius, the difference with Rodr&iacute;guez, one of his first companions, must have been more bitter still. Rodr&iacute;guez had founded the Province of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, and brought it in a short <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> to a high state of efficiency. But his methods were not precisely those of Ignatius, and, when new men of Ignatius' own training came under him, differences soon made themselves felt. A struggle ensued in which Rodr&iacute;guez unfortunately took sides against Ignatius' envoys. The results for the newly formed province were disastrous. Well-nigh half of its members had to be expelled before peace was established; but Ignatius did not hesitate. Rodriguez having been recalled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the new provincial being empowered to dismiss him if he refused, he demanded a formal trial, which Ignatius, foreseeing the results, endeavoured to ward off. But on Sim&oacute;n's insistence a full court of inquiry was granted, whose proceedings are now printed and it unanimously condemned Rodriguez to penance and banishment from the province (Scripta etc., pp. 666-707). Of all his external works, those nearest his heart, to judge by his correspondence, were the building and foundation of the <a href="../cathen/08157a.htm">Roman College</a> (1551), and of the German College (1552). For their sake he begged, worked, and borrowed with splendid insistence until his death. The success of the first was ensured by the generosity of <a href="../cathen/06213a.htm">St. Francis Borgia</a>, before he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. The latter was still in a struggling <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> when Ignatius died, but his great <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and best foundation of both.

<p>In the summer of 1556 the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was attacked by Roman fever. His <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> did not foresee any serious consequences, but the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> did. On 30 July, 1556, he asked for the last <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, but he was told that no immediate danger threatened. Next morning at daybreak, the infirmarian found him lying in peaceful <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, so peaceful that he did not at once perceive that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was actually dying. When his condition was realized, the last <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> was given, but the end came before the <a href="../cathen/07421b.htm">holy oils</a> could be fetched. Perhaps he had <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that his death, like his life, might pass without any demonstration. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> on 27 July, 1609, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a> on 22 May, 1622. His body lies under the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a> designed by Pozzi in the Ges&ugrave;. Though he died in the sixteenth year from the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, that body already numbered about 1000 religious (of whom, however, only 35 were yet <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">professed</a>) with 100 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>, arranged in 10 provinces. (Sacchini, op. cit. infra., lib. 1, cc. i, nn. 1-20.) For his place in history see <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">C<font size=-2>OUNTER</font>-R<font size=-2>EFORMATION</font></a>. It is impossible to sketch in brief Ignatius' grand and complex <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>: ardent yet restrained, fearless, resolute, simple, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, strong, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> conception of him as a restless, bustling pragmatist bears no correspondence at all with the peacefulness and perseverance which characterized the real man. That he was a strong disciplinarian is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. In a young and rapidly growing body that was inevitable; and the age <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> strong <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But if he believed in <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> as an <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educative</a> force, he despised any other motives for action except the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. It was by studying Ignatius as a ruler that Xavier learnt the principle, "the company of Jesus ought to be called the company of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and conformity of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>". (Ep., 12 Jan., 1519).
