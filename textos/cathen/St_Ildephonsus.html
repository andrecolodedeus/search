<div id="springfield2">
<h1>St. Ildephonsus</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo; died 23 January, 667. He was born of a distinguished <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and was a nephew of St. Eugenius, his predecessor in the See of Toledo. At an early age, despite the determined opposition of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, he embraced the monastic life in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Agli, near Toledo. While he was still a simple <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, he founded and endowed a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> <em>in Deibiensi villula.</em> We learn from his writings that he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> (about 630) by Helladius, who had been his <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and was afterwards elected <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo. Ildephonsus himself became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Agli, and in this capacity was one of the signatories, in 653 and 655, at the Eighth and Ninth Councils of Toledo. Called by King Reccesvinth, towards the end of 657, to fill the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> throne, he governed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Toledo for a little more than nine years and was buried in the Basilica of <a href="../cathen/09173b.htm">Saint Leocadia</a>. To these scanty but authentic details of his life (they are attested by Ildephonsus himself, or by his immediate successor, Archbishop Julianus, in a short biographical notice which he added to the "De viris illustribus" of Ildephonsus) some <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> or even legendary anecdotes were added later. At the end of the eighth century Cixila, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo, embellished the biography of his predecessor. He relates that Ildephonsus was the disciple of <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore of Seville</a>, and recalls in particular two marvellous stories, of which the second, a favourite theme of hagiographers, poets, and artists, has been for ages entwined with the memory of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. Ildephonsus, it is said, was one day <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> before the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/09173b.htm">Saint Leocadia</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> arose from her <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> and thanked the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion</a> he showed towards the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>. It was related, further, that on another occasion the Blessed Virgin appeared to him in person and presented him with a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> vestment, to reward him for his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in honouring her.

<p>The literary work of Ildephonsus is better known than the details of his life, and merits for him a distinguished place in the roll of Spanish writers. His successor, Julianus of Toledo, in the notice already referred to, informs us that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> himself divided his works into four parts. The first and principal division contained six treatises, of which two only have been preserved: "De virginitate perpetu&acirc; sanctae Mariae adversus tres infideles" (these three unbelievers are Jovinianus, Helvidius, and "a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>"), a bombastic work which displays however a spirit of ardent <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and assures Ildephonsus a place of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> among the devoted servants of the Blessed Virgin; also a treatise in two books: (1) "Annotationes de cognitione baptismi", and (2) "Liber de itinere deserti, quo itur post baptismum". Recent researches have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the first book is only a new edition of a very important treatise compiled, at the latest, in the sixth century, Ildephonsus having contributed to it only a few additions (Helfferich, "Der westgothische Arianismus", 1860, 41-49). The second part of his works contained the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> correspondence; of this portion, there are still preserved two letters of Quiricus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, with the replies of Ildephonsus. The third part comprised masses, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, and sermons; and the fourth, <em>opuscula</em> in prose and verse, especially epitaphs. The editions of the complete works of Ildephonsus contain a certain number of writings, several of which may be placed in either of the last two divisions; but some of them are of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> authenticity, while the remainder are certainly the work of another author. Moreover, Julianus states that Ildephonsus began a good number of other works, but his many cares would not permit of his finishing them. On the other hand, he makes no mention of a little work which is certainly authentic, the "De viris illustribus". It may be considered as a supplement to the "De viris illustribus" of <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore of Seville</a>, and is not so much a literary historical work as a writing intended to glorify the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Toledo and defend the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>.
