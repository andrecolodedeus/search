<h1>St. Ine</h1>  

<p>(Ini or Ina).

<p>King of West Saxons, d. 728. He was a son of the underking Cenred and ascended the West-Saxon throne in 688, a year before the death of his predecessor Caedwalla. For thirty-seven years he ruled over a turbulent and war-like people, and by virtue of a varied genius was equally successful as a warrior and legislator. His first efforts were directed towards establishing internal peace, and in the fifth year of his reign he drew up a set of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which regulated the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and fixed the legal status of the various elapses of his subjects. With the exception of the Kentish <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> this code is the earliest extant specimen of Anglo-Saxon legislation, and for that reason is of particular interest. When matters in his own realm had been adjusted, Ine turned his attention to Withred, King of Kent, and at the head of a formidable army demanded <em>weregild</em> for the death of Mul (for Mollo), brother of Caedwalla. Withred paid the full compensation &mdash; thirty thousand pounds of silver&mdash;and admitted the supremacy of the West-Saxon over all the country held by the English south of the Thames.

<p>By successive conquests, Ine added several districts to the western provinces of his domain, and after a bitter <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> conquered Geraint, King of Cornwall, and built a fortress on the Tone, at the site of the present Taunton. Throughout his entire reign was particularly solicitous for the welfare of religion and religious establishment, founding many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and endowing those already in existence. The Abbey of Glastonbury was erected by him, with the funds, it is thought, which came from the weregild collected from Withred. Other monastic establishments which were recipients of his bounty were those at <a href="../cathen/09572c.htm">Malmesbury</a>, <a href="../cathen/15648a.htm">Wimborne</a>, Nursling, Tisbury, <a href="../cathen/15545a.htm">Waltham</a>, and Sherborne.

<p>Worn out by his long rule, Ine determined to abdicate in favour of &AElig;thelheard and Oswald, and to make his peace with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In pursuance of this project, he convened the Witenagemot and formally announced his abdication. With his wife he proceeded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to watch and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the Apostles in the guise of a poor and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> pilgrim. While there he founded a hospice or home for English <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, in the district known as Burges Saxonum, the modern Borgo. Some historians trace the foundation of the English College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> back to this hospice. The memory of the hospice still lives in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Spirito in Sassia, formerly S. Maria in Saxia; it is thought that King Ine and his Queen Ethelburga, lie buried in this church or in the atrium of <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. They died blessing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that they had been allowed to lay their dust in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> soil of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.
