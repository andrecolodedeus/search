<h1>St. Irenaeus</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Father of the Church</a>.

<p>Information as to his life is scarce, and in some measure inexact. He was born in Proconsular <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, or at least in some province bordering thereon, in the first half of the second century; the exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> is controverted, between the years 115 and 125, according to some, or, according to others, between 130 and 142. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that, while still very young, Irenaeus had seen and heard the holy Bishop <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> (d. 155) at <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a>, Irenaeus was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Church of Lyons</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of that city, many of whom were suffering <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> for the Faith, sent him (177 or 178) to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with a letter to <a href="../cathen/05378a.htm">Pope Eleutherius</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanism</a>, and on that occasion bore emphatic testimony to his merits. Returning to <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, Irenaeus succeeded the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Saint Pothinus as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. During the religious peace which followed the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a>, the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> divided his activities between the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> and of a missionary (as to which we have but brief data, late and not very certain) and his writings, almost all of which were directed against <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> then spreading in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> and elsewhere. In 190 or 191 he interceded with Pope Victor to lift the sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> laid by that pontiff upon the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> which persevered in the practice of the Quartodecimans in regard to the celebration of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. Nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death, which must have occurred at the end of the second or the beginning of the third century. In spite of some isolated and later testimony to that effect, it is not very probable that he ended his career with <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 28 June in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, and on 23 August in the Greek.

<p>Irenaeus wrote in Greek many works which have secured for him an exceptional place in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature, because in controverted religious questions of capital importance they exhibit the testimony of a contemporary of the heroic age of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, of one who had heard <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">St. Polycarp</a>, the disciple of St. John, and who, in a manner, belonged to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> Age. None of these writings has come down to us in the original text, though a great many fragments of them are extant as citations in later writers (<a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>, <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, etc.). Two of these works, however, have reached us in their entirety in a Latin version: <ul><li>A treatise in five books, commonly entitled <em>Adversus haereses</em>, and devoted, according to its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> title, to the "Detection and Overthrow of the False Knowledge" (see <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">GNOSTICISM</a>, sub-title <em>Refutation of Gnosticism</em>). Of this work we possess a very ancient Latin translation, the scrupulous fidelity of which is beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. It is the chief work of Irenaeus and truly of the highest importance; it contains a profound exposition not only of <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a> under its different forms, but also of the principal <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> which had sprung up in the various <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities, and thus constitutes an invaluable source of information on the most ancient <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> literature from its beginnings to the end of the second century. In refuting the heterodox systems Irenaeus often opposes to them the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and in this way furnishes positive and very early evidence of high importance. Suffice it to mention the passages, so often and so fully commented upon by <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and polemical writers, concerning the origin of the Gospel according to St. John (see <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">GOSPEL OF SAINT JOHN</a>), the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, and the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. <li>Of a second work, written after the "Adversus Haereses", an ancient literal translation in the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> language. This is the "Proof of the Apostolic Preaching." The author's aim here is not to confute <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, but to confirm the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> by expounding the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> to them, and notably by demonstrating the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Gospel by means of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> prophecies. Although it contains fundamentally, so to speak, nothing that has not already been expounded in the "Adversus Haereses", it is a document of the highest interest, and a magnificent testimony of the deep and lively <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Irenaeus.</ul> Of his other works only scattered fragments exist; many, indeed, are known only through the mention made of them by later writers, not even fragments of the works themselves having come down to us. These are <ul><li>a treatise against the Greeks entitled "On the Subject of Knowledge" (mentioned by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>); <li>a writing addressed to the Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Florinus "On the Monarchy, or How God is not the Cause of Evil" (fragment in <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>); <li>a work "On the Ogdoad", probably against the Ogdoad of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus the Gnostic</a>, written for the same <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Florinus, who had gone over to the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the Valentinians (fragment in <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>); <li>a treatise on <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, addressed to Blastus (mentioned by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>); <li>a letter to Pope Victor against the Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Florinus (fragment preserved in Syriac); <li>another letter to the same on the Paschal controversies (extracts in <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>); <li>other letters to various correspondents on the same subject (mentioned by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, a fragment preserved in Syriac); <li>a book of divers discourses, probably a collection of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> (mentioned by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>); and <li>other minor works for which we have less clear or less certain attestations.</ul> The four fragments which Pfaff published in 1715, ostensibly from a <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, have been proven by Funk to be <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>, and Harnack has established the fact that Pfaff himself fabricated them.
