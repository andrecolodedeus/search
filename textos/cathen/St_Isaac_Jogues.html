<h1>St. Isaac Jogues</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> missionary, born at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans, France</a>, 10 January, 1607; <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at <a href="../cathen/02111b.htm">Ossernenon</a>, in the present <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a>, 18 October, 1646. He was the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who ever came to Manhattan Island (<a href="../cathen/11020a.htm">New York</a>). He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in 1624 and, after having been professor of literature at <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, was sent as a missionary to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> in 1636. He came out with <a href="../cathen/10543a.htm">Montmagny</a>, the immediate successor of <a href="../cathen/03567a.htm">Champlain</a>. From <a href="../cathen/12593c.htm">Quebec</a> he went to the regions around the great lakes where the illustrious <a href="../cathen/02751b.htm">Father de Br&eacute;beuf</a> and others were labouring. There he spent six years in constant danger. Though a daring missionary, his character was of the most practical nature, his purpose always being to fix his people in permanent habitations. He was with <a href="../cathen/06388b.htm">Garnier</a> among the <a href="../cathen/11784b.htm">Petuns</a>, and he and <a href="../cathen/12669b.htm">Raymbault</a> penetrated as far as <a href="../cathen/13487a.htm">Sault Ste Marie</a>, and "were the first missionaries", says Bancroft (VII, 790, London, 1853), "to preach the gospel a thousand miles in the interior, five years before John Eliot addressed the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indians</a> six miles from <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> Harbour". There is little <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that they were not only the first apostles but also the first white men to reach this outlet of Lake Superior. No documentary <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> is adduced by the best-known historians that Nicholet, the discoverer of Lake Michigan, ever visited the Sault. Jogues proposed not only to <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">convert</a> the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indians</a> of Lake Superior, but the <a href="../cathen/14017a.htm">Sioux</a> who lived at the head waters of the Mississippi.

<p>His plan was thwarted by his capture near <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a> returning from <a href="../cathen/12593c.htm">Quebec</a>. He was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> on 3 August, 1642, and after being cruelly tortured was carried to the Indian village of <a href="../cathen/02111b.htm">Ossernenon</a>, now <a href="../cathen/02111b.htm">Auriesville</a>, on the Mohawk, about forty miles above the present city of <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>. There he remained for thirteen months in <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">slavery</a>, suffering apparently beyond the power of natural endurance. The <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> at Fort Orange (<a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>) made constant efforts to free him, and at last, when he was about to be burnt to death, induced him to take refuge in a sailing vessel which carried him to <a href="../cathen/11020a.htm">New Amsterdam</a> (<a href="../cathen/11020a.htm">New York</a>). His description of the colony as it was at that time has since been incorporated in the Documentary History of the State. From <a href="../cathen/11020a.htm">New York</a> he was sent; in mid-winter, across the ocean on a lugger of only fifty tons burden and after a voyage of two months, landed <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> morning, 1643, on the coast of Brittany, in a state of absolute destitution. Thence he found his way to the nearest college of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. He was received with great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> at the court of the Queen Regent, the mother of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, and was allowed by <a href="../cathen/15218a.htm">Pope Urban VII</a> the very exceptional <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a> of celebrating <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>, which the mutilated condition of his hands had made canonically impossible; several of his fingers having been eaten or burned off. He was called a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pontiff</a>. No similar concession, up to that, is known to have been granted.

<p>In early spring of 1644 he returned to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and in 1646 was sent to negotiate peace with the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>. He followed the same route over which he had been carried as a captive. It was on this occasion that he gave the name of Lake of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> to the body of water called by the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indians</a> Horicon, now known as Lake George. He reached <a href="../cathen/02111b.htm">Ossernenon</a> on 5 June, after a three weeks' journey from the <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>. He was well received by his former captors and the treaty of peace was made. He started for <a href="../cathen/12593c.htm">Quebec</a> on 16 June and arrived there 3 July. He immediately asked to be sent back to the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> as a missionary, but only after much hesitation his superiors acceded to his request. On 27 September he began his third and last journey to the Mohawk. In the interim sickness had broken out in the tribe and a blight had fallen on the crops. This double calamity was ascribed to Jogues whom the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indians</a> always regarded as a sorcerer. They were determined to wreak vengence on him for the spell he had cast on the place, and warriors were sent out to capture him. The news of this change of sentiment spread rapidly, and though fully aware of the danger Jogues continued on his way to <a href="../cathen/02111b.htm">Ossernenon</a>, though all the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a> and others who were with him fled except Lalande. The <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> met him near Lake George, stripped him naked, slashed him with their knives, beat him and then led him to the village. On 18 October, 1646, when entering a cabin he was struck with a tomahawk and afterwards decapitated. The head was fixed on the Palisades and the body thrown into the Mohawk.

<p>In view of his possible <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> a preliminary court was established in <a href="../cathen/12593c.htm">Quebec</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> to receive testimony as to his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and the cause of his death.

<p>[<em>Note:</em> Isaac Jogues was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Pope Pius XI on June 29, 1930, with seven other North American <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Their collective <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a> is October 19.]
