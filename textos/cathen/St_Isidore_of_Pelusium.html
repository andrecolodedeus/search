<div id="springfield2">
<h1>St. Isidore of Pelusium</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> in the latter half of the fourth century; d. not later than 449-50. He is occasionally designated through mistake as Isidore of <a href="../cathen/04615b.htm">Damietta</a>. Leaving his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and possessions, Isidore retired to a mountain near the city of <a href="../cathen/11610d.htm">Pelusium</a>, the name of which was henceforth connected with his own, and embraced the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Lychnos, where he soon became remarkable for his exactitude in the observance of the rule and for his austerities. A passage in his voluminous correspondence affords reason to believe that he held the office of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. He is spoken of as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by Facundus and <a href="../cathen/14328a.htm">Suidas</a>, although neither of these writers informs us concerning the church to which he belonged; it may be that he had no <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> charge, but was only a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. His correspondence gives us an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of his activity. It shows him fighting against unworthy <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> whose elevation to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> was a serious peril and <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. He complains that many <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> were ceasing to approach the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> so as to avoid contact with these discreditable men. His veneration for <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> led him to introduce <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a> to render full <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to the memory of the great doctor. He opposed the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, and during the conflict which arose at the end of the Council of Ephesus between St. Cyril and <a href="../cathen/08468a.htm">John of Antioch</a>, he believed there was too much obstinacy on St. Cyril's side. He therefore wrote to the latter in urgent terms imploring him, as his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> arid as his son, to put an end to this division and not to make a private grievance the pretext for an eternal rupture. St. Isidore was still alive when the <a href="../cathen/05633a.htm">heresy of Eutyches</a> began to spread in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; many of his letters depict him as opposing the assertion of only one nature in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. It seems as though his life was scarcely prolonged beyond the year 449, because there is no mention in letters of the <a href="../cathen/05495a.htm">Robber Council of Ephesus</a> (August, 449) nor of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451).

<p>According to <a href="../cathen/05639b.htm">Evagrius</a>, St. Isidore was the author of a great number of writings, but this historian tells us nothing further, save that one of these was addressed to Cyril, even leaving us <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> whether this <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> was the celebrated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> or a namesake. Isidore himself tells incidentally that he composed a treatise "Adversus <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>" but it has been lost. Another work "De Fato", which, the author tells us, met with a certain degree of success, has also been lost. The only extant works of St. Isidore are a considerable correspondence, comprising more than 2000 letters. Even this number appears to fall far short of the amount actually written, since Nicephorus speaks of 10,000. Of these we possess 2182, divided into five books which contain respectively 590, 380, 413, 230, and 569 letters. These letters of St. Isidore may be divided into three classes according to the subjects treated: those dealing with <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> and Scripture, with <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and monastic discipline, and with practical morality for the guidance of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> of all classes and conditions. Many of these letters, as is natural, have but a secondary importance, many are mere notes. In this article attention can be drawn only to the principal ones. Among these is the letter to Theologius against the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, in which Isidore points out that there is this difference between the mother of the gods in fable and the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, of that the former, as acknowledged by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> themselves, conceived and brought forth the fruits of debauchery, whereas the latter conceived without having had intercourse with any man, as is acknowledged says he, by all the nations of the world. His letter to Hierax defends the legitimacy of the veneration of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>; that to Tuba shows that it was considered unbecoming for a soldier to carry a sword in the city in time of peace and to appear in public with arms and military uniform.

<p>His letters addressed to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> following the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> afford many important clues which enable us to form a fairly exact <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> standard then existing in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> monastic centres. Isidore reproaches the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Thalel&aelig;eus with being interested in reading <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> historians and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> poets which were full of fables, lies, and obscenities capable of opening wounds that had healed and of recalling the spirit of uncleanness to the house from which it had been ejected. His advice with regard to those who were embracing the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> state was that they should not at first be made to feel all the austerities of the rule lest they should be repelled, nor should they be left idle and exempt from ordinary tasks lest they should acquire habits of laziness, but they should led step by step to what is most perfect. Great abstinences serve no purpose unless they are accompanied by the <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> of the senses. In a great number of St. Isidore's letters concerning the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> state it may be remarked that he holds it to consist mainly in retirement and obedience; that retirement includes forgetfulness of the things one has abandoned and the renunciation of old habits, while obedience is attended with <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> of the flesh. A <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk's</a> habit should if possible be of skins, and his food consist of herbs, unless bodily weakness require something more, in which case he should be guided by the judgment of his superior, for he must not be governed by his own will, but according to the will of those who have grown old in the practice of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>.

<p>Although for the most part very brief, the majority of St. Isidore's letters contain much instruction, which is often set forth with elegance, occasionally with a certain literary art. The style is natural, unaffected, and yet not without refinement. The correspondence is characterized by an imperturbable equability of temperament; whether he is engaged at explaining or reprimanding, at disputing or praising, there is always the same moderation, the same sentiments of sincerity, the same sober taste. In the explanation of the Scripture the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> does not conceal his preference for the moral and spiritual sense which he judges most useful for those who consult him. Everywhere he is seen to put in practice the maxims he teaches to others, namely that the life should correspond with the words, that one should practice what one teaches, and that it is not sufficient to indicate what should be done, if one does not translate one's maxims into action.
