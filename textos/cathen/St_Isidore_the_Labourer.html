<h1>St. Isidore the Labourer</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> daylabourer; b. near <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, about the year 1070; d. 15 May, 1130, at the same place. He was in the service of a certain Juan de Vargas on a farm in the vicinity of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. Every morning before going to work he was accustomed to hear a Mass at one of the churches in <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. One day his fellow-labourers complained to their master that Isidore was always late for work in the morning. Upon investigation, so runs the legend, the master found Isidore at <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, while an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was doing the ploughing for him. On another occasion his master saw an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> ploughing on either side of him, so that Isidore's work was equal to that of three of his fellow-labourers. Isidore is also said to have brought back to life the deceased daughter of his master and to have caused a fountain of fresh water to burst from the dry earth in order to quench the thirst of his master. He was married to Maria Torribia, a <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, who is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> as Maria della Cabeza, from the fact that her head (Spanish, <em>cabeza</em>) is often carried in <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> especially in time of drought. They had one son, who died in his youth. On one occasion this son fell into a deep well and at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> the water of the well is said to have risen <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> to the level of the ground, bringing the child with it, alive and well. Hereupon the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of continence and lived in separate houses. Forty years after Isidore's death, his body was transferred from the cemetery to the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Andrew. He is said to have appeared to Alfonso of Castile, and to have shown him the hidden path by which he surprised the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> and gained the victory of Las Nevas de Tolosa, in 1212. When King Philip III of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> was cured of a deadly disease by touching the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, the king replaced the old <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> by a costly silver one. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a>, along with Sts. Ignatius, Francis Xavier, Teresa, and Philip Neri, on 12 March, 1622. St. Isidore is widely <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as the patron of peasants and day-labourers. The cities of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>, <a href="../cathen/13468c.htm">Saragossa</a>, and Seville also, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> him as their patron. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 15 May.
