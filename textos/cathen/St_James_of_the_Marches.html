<h1>St. James of the Marches</h1>  

<p>Franciscan, b. of a poor <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> named Gangala, at Monteprandone, <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 1391; d. at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, 28 Nov., 1476. He is generally represented holding in his right hand a <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, out of which a snake is escaping --an allusion to some endeavours of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to poison him or, less likely, to the controversy about the Precious Blood.

<p>He began his studies at Offida under the guidance of his uncle, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who soon afterwards put him to <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/01774a.htm">Ascoli</a>. At the <a href="../cathen/11737a.htm">University of Perugia</a> he took the degree of Doctor in Civil Law. After a short stay at Florence as tutor in a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and as judge of sorcerers, James was received into the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Order of the Friars Minor</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Portiuncula, <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, 26 July, 1416. Having finished his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at the hermitage of the Carceri, near <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, he studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/06070a.htm">Fiesole</a>, near <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, under <a href="../cathen/02505b.htm">St. Bernardine of Siena</a>. On 13 June, 1420, be was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and soon began to preach in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, in the Marches, and Umbria; for half a century he carried on his spiritual labours, remarkable for the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> he performed and the numerous conversions he wrought. From 1427 James preached penance, combated <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, and was on legations in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and Bosnia. In the last-mentioned country he was also commissary of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>. At the time of the Council of Basle he promoted the union of the moderate <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and that of the Greeks it the Council of Ferrara-Florence. Against the Turk, he preached several <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a>, and at the death of St. John Capistran, in 1456, James was sent to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> as his successor. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> he fought the Fraticelli, instituted several <a href="../cathen/10534d.htm"><em>montes pietatis</em></a>, and preached in all the greater cities; <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> offered him the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in 1460, which he declined. St. James belonged to the Observant branch of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>, then rapidly spreading and exciting much <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. How much he suffered on this account is shown in a letter written by him to St. John Capistran, published by Nic. Dal-Gal, O.F.M., in "Archivum Franciscanum Historicum", I (1908), 94-97. Under <a href="../cathen/03187a.htm">Callistus III</a>, in 1455, he was appointed an arbiter on the questions at issue between <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a> and Observants. His decision was published 2 Feb., 1456, in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a>, which pleased neither part . A few years later, on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Monday, 1462, St. James, preaching at <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>, uttered the opinion of some <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, that the Precious Blood shed during the Passion was not united with the Divinity of Christ during the three days of His burial. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/08277a.htm">James of Brescia</a>, inquisitor, immediately cited him to his tribunal. James refused to appear, and after some troubles appealed to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The question was discussed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, 1462 (not 1463, as some have it), before <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, but no decision was given. James spent the last three years of his life at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and was buried there in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> church of S. Maria la Nuova, where his body is still to be seen. Beatified by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, 1624, he was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, 1726. <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> venerates him as one of its <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saints</a> (feast, 28 Nov.).

<p>The works of St. James of the Marches have not as yet been collected. His <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> and autographs are preserved in part at the Municipio of Monteprandone (see Crivellucci, "I codici della libreria raccolta da S. Giacomo della Marca nel convento di S. Maria delle Grazie presso Monteprandone", Leghorn, 1889). He wrote "Dialogus contra Fraticellos" printed in <a href="../cathen/02242a.htm">Baluze</a>-Mansi, "Miscellanea", II, <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, 1761, 595-610 (cf. Ehrle in "Archiv f&uuml;r Litt. u. Kirchengeschichte", IV, Freiburg im Br., 1888, 107-10). His numerous sermons are not edited. For some of them, and for his treatise on the "Miracles of the Name of Jesus", see Candido Mariotti, O.F.M., "Nome di Ges&ugrave; ed i Francescani", <a href="../cathen/05785a.htm">Fano</a>, 1909, 125-34. On his notebook, or "Itinerarium", See Luigi Tasso, O.F.M., in "Miscellanea Francescana", I (1886), 125-26: "Regula confitendi peccata" was several times edited in Latin and Italian during the fifteenth century. "De Sanguine Christi effuse" and some other treatises remained in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>.
