<h1>St. James the Greater</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>Yakob</em>; <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> <em>Iakob</em>; N.T. Greek <em>Iakobos</em>; a favourite name among the later <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>).

<p>The son of Zebedee and <a href="../cathen/13403a.htm">Salome</a> (Cf. <a href="../bible/mat027.htm#vrs56">Matthew 27:56</a>; <a href="../bible/mar015.htm#vrs40">Mark 15:40</a>; <a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs1">16:1</a>). Zahn asserts that Salome was the daughter of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. James is styled "the Greater" to distinguish him from the Apostle James "the Less", who was probably shorter of stature. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of St. James's early life. He was the brother of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>, the beloved disciple, and probably the elder of the two.

<p>His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> seem to have been people of means as appears from the following facts. <ul> <li>Zebedee was a fisherman of the <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">Lake of Galilee</a>, who probably lived in or near Bethsaida (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs44">John 1:44</a>), perhaps in Capharnaum; and had some boatmen or hired men as his usual attendants (<a href="../bible/mar001.htm#vrs20">Mark 1:20</a>). <li>Salome was one of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who afterwards followed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and "ministered unto him of their substance" (cf. <a href="../bible/mat027.htm#vrs55">Matthew 27:55</a>, sq.; <a href="../bible/mar015.htm#vrs40">Mark 15:40</a>; <a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs1">16:1</a>; <a href="../bible/luk008.htm#vrs2">Luke 8:2 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/luk023.htm#vrs55">23:55</a>-<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#vrs1">24:1</a>). <li>St. John was personally known to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> (<a href="../bible/joh018.htm#vrs16">John 18:16</a>); and must have had wherewithal to provide for the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of Jesus</a> (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs27">John 19:27</a>).</ul>

<p>It is probable, according to <a href="../bible/act004.htm#vrs13">Acts 4:13</a>, that John (and consequently his brother James) had not received the technical training of the rabbinical schools; in this sense they were unlearned and without any official position among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. But, according to the social rank of their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, they must have been men of ordinary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, in the common walks of Jewish life. They had frequent opportunity of coming in contact with Greek life and language, which were already widely spread along the shores of the Galilean Sea.
<h2>Relation of St. James to Jesus</h2>

<p>Some authors, comparing <a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs25">John 19:25</a> with <a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs56">Matthew 28:56</a> and <a href="../bible/mar015.htm#vrs40">Mark 15:40</a>, identify, and probably rightly so, Mary the Mother of James the Less and of Joseph in Mark and Matthew with "Mary of Cleophas" in John. As the name of <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a> occurs in the three lists, they identify further Salome in Mark with "the mother of the sons of Zebedee" in Matthew; finally they identify Salome with "his mother's sister" in John. They suppose, for this last identification, that four <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are designated by <a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs25">John 19:25</a>; the Syriac "Peshito" gives the reading: "His mother and his mother's sister, and <a href="../cathen/09748b.htm">Mary of Cleophas</a> and <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a>." If this last supposition is right, Salome was a sister of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and James the Greater and John were first cousins of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>; this may explain the discipleship of the two brothers, Salome's request and their own claim to the first position in His kingdom, and His commendation of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> to her own nephew. But it is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether the Greek admits of this construction without the addition or the omission of <em>kai</em> (and). Thus the relationship of St. James to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> remains <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>.
<h2>His life and apostolate</h2>

<p>The Galilean origin of St. James in some degree explains the energy of temper and the vehemence of character which earned for him and St. John the name of <em>Boanerges</em>, "sons of thunder" (<a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs17">Mark 3:17</a>); the Galilean race was religious, hardy, industrious, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a>, and the strongest defender of the Jewish nation.

<p>When <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> proclaimed the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, St. John became a disciple (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs35">John 1:35</a>); he was directed to "the Lamb of God" and afterwards brought his brother James to the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>; the obvious meaning of <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs41">John 1:41</a>, is that St. Andrew finds his brother (St. Peter) first and that afterwards St. John (who does not name himself, according to his habitual and characteristic reserve and silence about himself) finds his brother (St. James). The call of St. James to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">discipleship</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> is reported in a parallel or identical narration by <a href="../bible/mat004.htm#vrs18">Matthew 4:18-22</a>; <a href="../bible/mar001.htm#vrs19">Mark 1:19 sq.</a>; and <a href="../bible/luk005.htm#vrs1">Luke 5:1-11</a>. The two sons of Zebedee, as well as Simon (Peter) and his brother Andrew with whom they were in partnership (<a href="../bible/luk005.htm#vrs10">Luke 5:10</a>), were called by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Sea of Galilee</a>, where all four with Zebedee and his hired servants were engaged in their ordinary occupation of fishing. The sons of Zebedee "forthwith left their nets and father, and followed him" (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#vrs22">Matthew 4:22</a>), and became "fishers of men".

<p>St. James was afterwards with the other eleven called to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostleship</a> (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs1">Matthew 10:1-4</a>; <a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs13">Mark 3:13-19</a>; <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#vrs12">Luke 6:12-16</a>; <a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs13">Acts 1:13</a>). In all four lists the names of Peter and Andrew, James and John form the first group, a prominent and chosen group (cf. <a href="../bible/mar013.htm#vrs3">Mark 13:3</a>); especially Peter, James, and John. These three Apostles alone were admitted to be present at the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of the raising of Jairus's daughter (<a href="../bible/mar005.htm#vrs37">Mark 5:37</a>; <a href="../bible/luk008.htm#vrs51">Luke 8:51</a>), at the Transfiguration (<a href="../bible/mar009.htm#vrs1">Mark 9:1</a>; <a href="../bible/mat017.htm#vrs1">Matthew 17:1</a>; <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#vrs28">Luke 9:28</a>), and the <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">Agony in Gethsemani</a> (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs37">Matthew 26:37</a>; <a href="../bible/mar014.htm#vrs33">Mark 14:33</a>). The fact that the name of James occurs always (except in <a href="../bible/luk008.htm#vrs51">Luke 8:51</a>; <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#vrs28">9:28</a>; <a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs13">Acts 1:13</a> &#151; Greek Text) before that of his brother seems to imply that James was the elder of the two. It is worthy of notice that James is never mentioned in the Gospel of St. John; this author observes a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> reserve not only with regard to himself, but also about the members of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>.



<p>Several incidents scattered through the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptics</a> suggest that James and John had that particular character indicated by the name "Boanerges," sons of thunder, given to them by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs17">Mark 3:17</a>); they were burning and impetuous in their evangelical <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and severe in temper. The two brothers showed their fiery temperament against "a certain man casting out devils" in the name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; John, answering, said: "We [James is probably meant] forbade him, because he followeth not with us" (<a href="../bible/luk009.htm#vrs49">Luke 9:49</a>). When the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> refused to receive <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, James and John said: "Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and consume them?" (<a href="../bible/luk009.htm#vrs54">Luke 9:54</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#vrs49">9:49</a>).
<h2>His martyrdom</h2>

<p>On the last journey to Jerusalem, their mother Salome came to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> and said to Him: "Say that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left, in thy kingdom" (<a href="../bible/mat020.htm#vrs21">Matthew 20:21</a>). And the two brothers, still <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the spiritual nature of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Messianic Kingdom</a>, joined with their mother in this eager <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> (<a href="../bible/mar010.htm#vrs37">Mark 10:37</a>). And on their assertion that they are willing to drink the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> that He drinks of, and to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of His sufferings, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> assured them that they will share His sufferings (<a href="../bible/mar005.htm#vrs38">Mark 5:38-39</a>).

<p>James won the crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> fourteen years after this prophecy, A.D. 44. <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#IV">Herod Agrippa I</a>, son of Aristobulus and grandson of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#I">Herod the Great</a>, reigned at that time as "king" over a wider dominion than that of his grandfather. His great object was to please the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in every way, and he showed great regard for the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a> and Jewish customs. In pursuance of this policy, on the occasion of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> of A.D. 44, he perpetrated cruelties upon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whose rapid growth incensed the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> temper of James and his leading part in the Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities probably led <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#IV">Agrippa</a> to choose him as the first victim. "He killed James, the brother of John, with the sword." (<a href="../bible/act012.htm#vrs1">Acts 12:1-2</a>). According to a tradition, which, as we learn from <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250102.htm"><em>Church History</em> II.9.2-3</a>), was received from <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (in the seventh book of his lost "Hypotyposes"), the accuser who led the Apostle to judgment, moved by his confession, became himself a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and they were beheaded together. As <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement</a> testifies expressly that the account was given him "by those who were before him," this tradition has a better foundation than many other traditions and legends respecting the Apostolic labours and death of St. James, which are related in the Latin "Passio Jacobi Majoris", the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a> "Acts of James", and so on.
<h2>St. James in Spain</h2>

<p>The tradition asserting that James the Greater preached the Gospel in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and that his body was translated to <a href="../cathen/04187b.htm">Compostela</a>, claims more serious consideration.

<p>According to this tradition St. James the Greater, having preached <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, returned to <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by order of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>; his body was <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> translated to Iria Flavia in the northwest of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and later to <a href="../cathen/04187b.htm">Compostela</a>, which town, especially during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, became one of the most famous places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> in the world. The <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of making a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Compostela to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the sepulchre of St. James is still reserved to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who alone of his own or ordinary right can dispense from it. In the twelfth century was founded the <a href="../cathen/13353a.htm">Order of Knights of St. James of Compostela</a>.

<p>With regard to the preaching of the Gospel in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> by St. James the greater, several difficulties have been raised: <ul><li>St. James suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> A.D. 44 (<a href="../bible/act012.htm#vrs2">Acts 12:2</a>), and, according to the tradition of the early Church, he had not yet left <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> at this time (cf. <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, <a href="../fathers/02106.htm"><em>Stromata</em> VI</a>; Apollonius, quoted by Eusebius, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.18</a>). <li><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> in his Epistle to the Romans (A.D. 58) expressed the intention to visit <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (<a href="../bible/rom015.htm#vrs24">Romans 15:24</a>) just after he had mentioned (<a href="../bible/rom015.htm#vrs20">15:20</a>) that he did not "build upon another man's foundation." <li>The argument <em>ex silentio</em>: although the tradition that James founded an <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Apostolic see</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> was current in the year 700, no certain mention of such tradition is to be found in the genuine writings of early writers nor in the early councils; the first certain mention we find in the ninth century, in <a href="../cathen/11125b.htm">Notker</a>, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of St. Gall (Martyrol., 25 July), Walafried Strabo (Poema de XII Apost.), and others. <li>The tradition was not unanimously admitted afterwards, while numerous scholars reject it. The <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> however defended it (see Acta Sanctorum, July, VI and VII, where other sources are given). </ul> The authenticity of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">sacred relic</a> of Compostela has been questioned and is still <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>. Even if St. James the Greater did not preach the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, his body may have been brought to <a href="../cathen/04187b.htm">Compostela</a>, and this was already the opinion of <a href="../cathen/11125b.htm">Notker</a>. According to another tradition, the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the Apostle are kept in the church of St-Saturnin at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (<a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>), but it is not improbable that such <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">sacred relics</a> should have been divided between two churches. A strong argument in favour of the authenticity of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">sacred relics</a> of Compostela is the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, "Omnipotens Deus," of 1 November, 1884.
