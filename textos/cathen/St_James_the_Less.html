<h1>St. James the Less</h1>  

<h2>The identity of James</h2>

<p>The name "James" in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is borne by several: <ol> <li><em>James, the son of Zebedee</em> &#151; <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a>, brother of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John, Apostle</a>; also called <a href="../cathen/08279b.htm">"James the Greater"</a>. <li><em>James, the son of Alpheus, <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a></em> &#151; <a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs3">Matthew 10:3</a>; <a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs18">Mark 3:18</a>; <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#vrs15">Luke 6:15</a>; <a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs13">Acts 1:13</a>. <li><em>James, the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a></em> &#151; <a href="../bible/mat013.htm#vrs55">Matthew 13:55</a>; <a href="../bible/mar006.htm#vrs3">Mark 6:3</a>; <a href="../bible/gal001.htm#vrs19">Galatians 1:19</a>. Without a shadow of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, he must be identified with the James of <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs2">Galatians 2:2</a> and <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs9">2:9</a>; <a href="../bible/act012.htm#vrs17">Acts 12:17</a>, <a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs13">15:13 sqq.</a> and <a href="../bible/act021.htm#vrs18">21:18</a>; and <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs7">1 Corinthians 15:7</a>. <li><em>James, the son of Mary, brother of Joseph (or Joses)</em> &#151; <a href="../bible/mar015.htm#vrs40">Mark 15:40</a> (where he is called <em>&#242; mikros</em> "the little", not the "less", as in the <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">D.V.</a>, nor the "lesser"); <a href="../bible/mat027.htm#vrs56">Matthew 27:56</a>. Probably the son of <a href="../cathen/04048b.htm">Cleophas</a> or Clopas (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs25">John 19:25</a>) where <a href="../cathen/09748b.htm">"Maria Cleoph&aelig;"</a> is generally translated "Mary the <em>wife</em> of Cleophas", as <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are commonly distinguished by the addition of their husband's name. <li><em>James, the brother of <a href="../cathen/08542b.htm">Jude</a></em> &#151; <a href="../bible/jud001.htm#vrs1">Jude 1:1</a>. Most <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> commentators identify <a href="../cathen/08542b.htm">Jude</a> with the "Judas Jacobi", the "brother of James" (<a href="../bible/luk006.htm#vrs16">Luke 6:16</a>; <a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs13">Acts 1:13</a>), called thus because his brother James was better known than himself in the <a href="../cathen/07326a.htm">primitive Church</a>. </ol>

<p>The identity of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> James (2), the son of Alpheus and James (3), the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (Acts 15, 21), although contested by many critics and, perhaps, not quite beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, is at least most highly probable, and by far the greater number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interpreters is considered as certain (see <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">BRETHREN OF THE LORD</a>, where the chief argument, taken from <a href="../bible/gal001.htm#vrs19">Galatians 1:19</a>, in favour of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostleship</a> of St. James the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a>, is to be found). The objection moved by Mader (Biblische Zeitschrift, 1908, p. 393 sqq.) against the common statement that <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">"Apostles"</a> in Galatians 1:19 is to be taken strictly in the sense of the "Twelve" has been strongly impugned by Steinmann (Der Katholik, 1909, p. 207 sqq.). The James (5) of <a href="../bible/jud001.htm#vrs1">Jude 1:1</a> must certainly be identified with James (3), the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The identification of James (3), the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a> and James (4), the son of Mary, and probably of <a href="../cathen/04048b.htm">Cleophas</a> or Clopas offers some difficulty. This identification requires the identity of Mary, the mother of James (<a href="../bible/mat027.htm#vrs56">Matthew 27:56</a>; <a href="../bible/mar015.htm#vrs40">Mark 15:40</a>), with <a href="../cathen/09748b.htm">Mary the wife of Cleophas</a> (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs25">John 19:25</a>), and, consequently, the identity of Alpheus (2) and <a href="../cathen/04048b.htm">Clopas</a> (4). As <a href="../cathen/04048b.htm">Clopas</a> and Alpheus are probably not two different transcriptions of the same Aramaic name <em>Halpai</em> (see <a href="../cathen/04048b.htm">CLEOPHAS</a>), it must be admitted that two different names have been borne by one man. Indeed, there are several examples of the use of two names (a <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">Hebrew</a> and a Greek or Latin name) to designate the same person (<a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon-Petrus</a>; <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Saulus-Paulus</a>), so that the identity of Alpheus and <a href="../cathen/04048b.htm">Cleophas</a> is by no means improbable.

<p>On the whole, although there is no full evidence for the identity of James (2), the son of Alpheus, and James (3), the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a>, and James (4), the son of <a href="../cathen/09748b.htm">Mary of Clopas</a>, the view that one and the same person is described in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> in these three different ways, is by far the most probable. There is, at any rate, very good ground (<a href="../bible/gal001.htm#vrs19">Galatians 1:19</a>, <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs9">2:9</a>, <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs12">2:12</a>) for <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> James, the son of Alpheus is the same person as James, the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a>, the well-known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01117a.htm">Acts</a>. As to the nature of the relationship which the name <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">"brother of the Lord"</a> is intended to express, see <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">BRETHREN OF THE LORD</a>.
<h2>James in the Scriptures</h2>

<p>Had we not identified James, the son of Alpheus with the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a>, we should only know his name and his <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostleship</a>. But the identity once admitted, we must consequently apply to him all the particulars supplied by the books of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. We may venture to assert that the training of James (and his brother <a href="../cathen/08542b.htm">Jude</a>), had been that which prevailed in all pious <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> homes and that it was therefore based on the knowledge of the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a> and the rigorous observance of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. Many facts point to the diffusion of the Greek language and culture throughout <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, as early as the first century <font size=-2>B.C.</font>; we may suppose that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, at least most of them, read and spoke Greek as well as Aramaic, from their childhood. James was called to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolate</a> with his brother <a href="../cathen/08542b.htm">Jude</a>; in all the four lists of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, he stands at the head of the third group (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs3">Matthew 10:3</a>; <a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs18">Mark 3:18</a>; <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#vrs16">Luke 6:16</a>; <a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs13">Acts 1:13</a>). Of James individually we hear no more until after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs5">1 Corinthians 15:5-7</a>) mentions that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> appeared to him before the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>.

<p>Then we lose sight of James till <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, three years after his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> (<font size=-2>A.D.</font> 37), went up to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve Apostles</a> he saw only <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and James the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/gal001.htm#vrs19">Galatians 1:19</a>; <a href="../bible/act009.htm#vrs27">Acts 9:27</a>). When in the year 44 <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> escaped from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, he desired that news of his release might be carried to James who held already a marked preeminence in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../bible/act012.htm#vrs17">Acts 12:17</a>). In the Council of Jerusalem (<font size=-2>A.D.</font> 51) he gives his sentence after <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a>, declaring as <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> had done, that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are not bound to <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, nor to the observance of the ceremonial <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a>, but at the same time, he urged the advisability of conforming to certain <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> and of respecting certain of the <a href="../cathen/13640a.htm">scruples</a> of their <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> fellow-Christians (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs13">Acts 15:13 sqq.</a>). On the same occasion, the "pillars" of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, James, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> "gave to me (<a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>) and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and they unto the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>" (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs9">Galatians 2:9</a>). He publicly commended the great charter of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> freedom from the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, although he still continued the observance in his own life, no longer as a strict <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, but as an ancient, most venerable and national custom, trusting to "be <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>" (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs11">Acts 15:11</a>). When afterwards some came from James to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> and led <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> into dissimulation (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs12">Galatians 2:12</a>), his name was used by them, though he had given them no such commandment to enforce their interpretation of the concordat which, on his proposal, had been adopted at the Council of Jerusalem. When <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> after his third missionary journey paid a visit to St. James (<font size=-2>A.D.</font> 58), the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and "the elders" "glorified the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>" and advised the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> to take part in the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> of a <a href="../cathen/10727a.htm">Nazarite</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, in order to show how false the charge was that he had spoken of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> as no longer to be regarded. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> consented to the advice of James and the elders (<a href="../bible/act021.htm#vrs1">Acts 21:1 sqq.</a>). The <a href="../cathen/08275b.htm">Epistle of St. James</a> reveals a grave, meek, and calm <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, nourished with the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptures</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, given to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, devoted to the <a href="../cathen/12236a.htm">poor</a>, resigned in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, the type of a just and apostolic man.
<h2>James outside of the Scriptures</h2>

<p>Traditions respecting James the Less are to be found in many <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">extra-canonical</a> documents, especially <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (Antiq., XX, ix, 1), the "Gospel according to the Hebrews" (St. Jerome, <a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 2</a>), <a href="../cathen/07194a.htm">Hegesippus</a> (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250102.htm"><em>Church History</em> II.23</a>), the <a href="../cathen/04039b.htm">pseudo-Clementine Homilies</a> (Ep. of Peter) and <a href="../fathers/080401.htm">Recognitions (I, 72, 73)</a>, <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (Hypot., vi, quoted by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250102.htm"><em>Church History</em> II.1</a>). The universal testimony of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity is entirely in accordance with the information derived from the <a href="../cathen/03274a.htm">canonical books</a> as to the fact that James was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. <a href="../cathen/07194a.htm">Hegesippus</a>, a <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, who lived about the middle of the second century, relates (and his narrative is highly probable) that James was called the "Just", that he drank no wine nor strong drink, nor ate animal food, that no razor touched his head, that he did not anoint himself or make use of the bath, and lastly that he was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>. The account of his death given by <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> is somewhat different. Later traditions deserve less attention.
