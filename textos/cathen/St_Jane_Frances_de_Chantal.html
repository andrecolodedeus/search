<h1>St. Jane Frances de Chantal</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 28 January, 1572; died at the <a href="../cathen/15481a.htm">Visitation</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">Convent</a> <a href="../cathen/10603b.htm">Moulins</a>, 13 December, 1641.

<p>Her father was president of the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, and leader of the royalist party during the <a href="../cathen/09098b.htm">League</a> that brought about the triumph of the cause of <a href="../cathen/07230a.htm">Henry IV</a>. In 1592 she married Baron de Chantal, and lived in the <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> castle of Bourbilly. She restored order in the household, which was on the brink of ruin, and brought back prosperity. During her husband's absence at the court, or with the army, when reproached for her extremely sober manner of dressing, her reply was: "The eyes which I must please are a hundred miles from here". She found more than once that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> with <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> the care she gave the suffering members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales's</a> eulogy of her characterizes her life at Bourbilly and everywhere else: "In Madame de Chantal I have found the <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> had difficulty in finding in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>".

<p>Baron de Chantal was accidentally killed by a harquebus while out shooting in 1601. Left a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> at twenty-eight, with four children, the broken-hearted baroness took a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. In all her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> she besought <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to send her a guide and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in a vision, showed her the <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a> He held in reserve for her. In order to safeguard her children's <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, she was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to go and live at Monthelon in the home of her father-in-law, who was ruled over by an arrogant and wicked servant. This was real servitude, which she bore patiently and gently for seven years. At last her <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> triumphed over the ill will of the old man and house keeper.

<p>During <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, 1604, she visited her father at <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a>, where <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a> was preaching at the Sainte Chapelle. She recognized in him the mysterious <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">director</a> who had been shown her, and placed herself under his guidance. Then began an admirable correspondence between the two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Unfortunately, the greater number of letters are no longer in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, as she destroyed them after the death of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. When she had assured the future security of children, and when she had provided the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of Celse-B&eacute;nigne, her fourteen year old son, whom she left to her father and her brother, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, she started for <a href="../cathen/01540a.htm">Annecy</a>, where <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was calling her to found the Congregation of the Visitation. She took her two remaining daughters with her, the elder having recently married the Baron of Thorens, a brother of <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a>. Celse-B&eacute;nigne, impetuous like those of her race, barred his mother's way by lying across the threshold. Mme de Chantal stopped, overcome: "Can the tears of a child shake her resolution?" said a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and learned <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the tutor of Celse-B&eacute;nigne. "Oh! no", replied the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, "but after all I am a mother!" And she stepped over the child's body.

<p>The Congregation of the Visitation was canonically established at <a href="../cathen/01540a.htm">Annecy</a> on <a href="../cathen/15058a.htm">Trinity Sunday</a>, 6 June, 1610. Its aim was to receive, with a view to their spiritual advancement, young girls and even <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> who had not the desire or strength to subject themselves to the austere <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetical</a> practices in force in all the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders at that <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a> was especially desirous of seeing the realization of his cherished method of attaining perfection, which consisted in always keeping one's will united to the Divine will, in taking so to speak one's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, heart, and longings into one's hands and giving them into <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> keeping, and in seeking always to do what is pleasing to Him. "I do always the things that please him" (<a href="../bible/joh008.htm#vrs29">John 8:29</a>). The two <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> founders saw their undertaking prosper. At the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of the death of <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a> in 1622, the order already counted thirteen houses; there were eighty-six when St. Jane Frances died; and 164 when she was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>.

<p>The remainder of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> life was spent under the protection of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> in the practice of the most admirable <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. If a gentle kindness, vivified and strengthened by a complete spirit of renunciation, predominates in <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a>, it is firmness and great vigour which prevails in St. Jane Frances; she did not like to see her daughters giving way to human weakness. Her trials were continuous and borne <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravely</a>, and yet she was exceedingly sensitive. Celse-B&eacute;nigne was an incorrigible <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duellist</a>. She <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> so fervently that he was given the grace to die a <a href="../cathen/04660c.htm">Christian death</a> on the battle-field, during the campaign against the Isle of R&eacute; (1627). He left a daughter who became the famous Marquise de S&eacute;vign&eacute;. To <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> troubles <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> added interior crosses which, particularly during the last nine years of her life, kept her in agony of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from which she was not freed until three months before her death.

<p>Her <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> was widespread. Queens, princes, and princesses flocked to the reception-room of the <a href="../cathen/15481a.htm">Visitation</a>. Wherever she went to establish foundations, the people gave her ovations. "These people", she would say confused, "do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me; they are mistaken". Her body is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> with that of <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a> in the church of the Visitation at <a href="../cathen/01540a.htm">Annecy</a>. She was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> in 1751, <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1767, and 21 August was appointed as her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a>.

<p>The life of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was written in the seventeenth century, with inimitable charm, by her secretary, Mother de Chaugy. <a href="../cathen/02710c.htm">Monsignor Bougaud</a>, who died <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Laval, published in 1863 a "Histoire de Sainte Chantal" which had a great and well-deserved success.

<p>The words of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> comprise instructions on the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, various minor works, among which is the admirable "Deposition for the Process of Beatification of St. Francis de Sales", and a great many letters. The saint's qualities are seen in her precise and vigorous style, void of imagery but betraying a repressed emotion, and bursting forth spontaneously from the heart, anticipating in its method the beautiful French of the seventeenth century. The book which may be called her masterpiece, "R&eacute;ponses sur les R&eacute;gles, Constitutions et Coutumes", a truly practical and complete code of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, is not in circulation.
