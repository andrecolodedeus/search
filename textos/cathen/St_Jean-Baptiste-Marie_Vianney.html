<h1>St. Jean-Baptiste-Marie Vianney</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">Cur&eacute;</a> of Ars, born at Dardilly, near <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons, France</a>, on 8 May, 1786; died at Ars, 4 August, 1859; son of Matthieu Vianney and Marie Beluze.

<p>In 1806, the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">cur&eacute;</a> at Ecully, M. Balley, opened a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students, and Jean-Marie was sent to him. Though he was of average intelligence and his masters never seem to have <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> his <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">vocation</a>, his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was extremely limited, being confined to a little arithmetic, history, and geography, and he found learning, especially the study of <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>, excessively difficult. One of his fellow-students, Matthias Loras, afterwards first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, assisted him with his <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> lessons.

<p>But now another obstacle presented itself. Young Vianney was drawn in the conscription, the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and the urgent need of recruits having caused <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> to withdraw the exemption enjoyed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students in the <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">diocese</a> of his uncle, <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Cardinal Fesch</a>. Matthieu Vianney tried unsuccessfully to procure a substitute, so his son was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to go. His regiment soon received marching orders. The morning of departure, Jean-Baptiste went to church to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and on his return to the barracks found that his comrades had already left. He was threatened with arrest, but the recruiting captain believed his story and sent him after the troops. At nightfall he met a young man who volunteered to guide him to his fellow-soldiers, but led him to Noes, where some deserters had gathered. The mayor persuaded him to remain there, under an assumed name, as schoolmaster. After fourteen months, he was able to communicate with his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. His father was vexed to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he was a deserter and ordered him to surrender but the matter was settled by his younger brother offering to serve in his stead and being accepted.

<p>Jean-Baptiste now resumed his studies at Ecully. In 1812, he was sent to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Verrieres; he was so deficient in <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> as to be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to follow the philosophy course in <a href="../cathen/06190a.htm">French</a>. He failed to pass the examinations for entrance to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> proper, but on re-examination three months later succeeded. On 13 August, 1815, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by Mgr. Simon, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>. His difficulties in making the preparatory studies seem to have been due to a lack of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> suppleness in dealing with theory as distinct from practice &#151; a lack accounted for by the meagreness of his early schooling, the advanced age at which he began to study, the fact that he was not of more than average intelligence, and that he was far advanced in spiritual <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and in the practice of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> long before he came to study it in the abstract. He was sent to Ecully as assistant to M. Balley, who had first recognized and encouraged his <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">vocation</a>, who urged him to persevere when the obstacles in his way seemed insurmountable, who interceded with the examiners when he failed to pass for the higher <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and who was his model as well as his preceptor and patron. In 1818, after the death of M. Balley, M. Vianney was made <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">parish priest</a> of Ars, a village not very far from <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. It was in the exercise of the functions of the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">parish priest</a> in this remote <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> hamlet that as the "cur&eacute; d'Ars" he became known throughout <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a>. A few years after he went to Ars, he founded a sort of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> for destitute girls. It was called "The Providence" and was the model of similar institutions established later all over <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. M. Vianney himself instructed the children of "The Providence" in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>, and these <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instructions came to be so popular that at last they were given every day in the church to large crowds. "The Providence" was the favourite work of the "cur&eacute; d'Ars", but, although it was successful, it was closed in 1847, because the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">cur&eacute;</a> thought that he was not justified in maintaining it in the face of the opposition of many good people. Its closing was a very heavy trial to him.

<p>But the chief labour of the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">Cur&eacute; d'Ars</a> was the <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">direction of souls</a>. He had not been long at Ars when people began coming to him from other <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, then from distant places, then from all parts of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and finally from other countries. As early as 1835, his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> forbade him to attend the annual <a href="../cathen/12795b.htm">retreats</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">diocesan clergy</a> because of "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> awaiting him yonder". During the last ten years of his life, he spent from sixteen to eighteen hours a day in the confessional. His advice was sought by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a>, young men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to their <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">vocation</a>, sinners, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in all sorts of difficulties and the sick. In 1855, the number of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> had reached twenty thousand a year. The most distinguished <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> visited Ars for the purpose of seeing the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">cur&eacute;</a> and hearing his daily instruction. The <a href="../cathen/04101a.htm">Venerable Father Colin</a> was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> at the same time, and was his life-long friend, while Mother Marie de la Providence founded the <a href="../cathen/07213a.htm">Helpers of the Holy Souls</a> on his advice and with his constant encouragement. His <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">direction</a> was characterized by common sense, remarkable insight, and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. He would sometimes divine <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> withheld in an imperfect <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confession</a>. His instructions were simple in language, full of imagery drawn from daily life and country scenes, but breathing <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which was his life principle and which he infused into his audience as much by his manner and appearance as by his words, for, at the last, his voice was almost inaudible.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> recorded by his biographers are of three classes:

<ul> <li>first, the obtaining of money for his <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charities</a> and food for his <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>; <li>secondly, <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the past and future; <li>thirdly, healing the sick, especially children.</ul>

<p>The greatest <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of all was his life. He practised <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> from his early youth. and for forty years his food and sleep were insufficient, humanly speaking, to sustain <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>. And yet he laboured incessantly, with unfailing <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, gentleness, patience, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">cheerfulness</a>, until he was more than seventy-three years old.

<p>On 3 October, 1874 Jean-Baptiste-Marie Vianney was proclaimed Venerable by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> and on 8 January, 1905, he was enrolled among the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">Blessed</a>. <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pope Pius X</a> proposed him as a model to the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">parochial clergy</a>.

<p>[<em>Note:</em> In 1925, Pope Pius XI <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> him. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 4 August.]
