<h1>St. Jean-Gabriel Perboyre</h1>  

<p>Missionary and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, born at Puech, <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Diocese of Cahors</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 6 January, 1802; <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at Ou-Tchang-Fou, <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, 11 September, 1840.

<p>Jean-Gabriel was one of eight children born to Pierre Perboyre and Marie Rigal. By reason of his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, he was the model of his companions during his childhood. While acting as companion to his younger brother, in the preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Moutauban, he felt the Divine call to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and after obtaining the consent of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> to take the step, he entered the noviciate of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Congregation of the Mission</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">Montauban</a>, December, 1818. On the feast of the <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">Holy Innocents</a>, 1820, he made the four <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Vincentians</a>. He was raised to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, 23 September, 1825, in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Sisters of Charity, by Bishop Dubourg, of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, and on the following day he said his first Mass. Shortly after, he was sent to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/13347b.htm">Saint-Flour</a> to teach <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>, and two years later, he was appointed superior of the preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/13347b.htm">Saint-Flour</a>. His great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and marvellous success induced his superiors, in 1832, to appoint him subdirector of the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He continued in this office until 1835, when he had sought and begged and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for, permission to go to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, there to preach, to suffer, and to die. He left Havre on 21 March, and on 29 August, 1835, arrived at <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a>, where he spent some time studying the Chinese language. On 21 December, 1835, he began his journey to Ho-Nan, the mission assigned him. In January, 1838, he was transferred to the mission of Hou-P&eacute;, in which, as in that of Ho-Nan, he laboured <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> and with great success. In September, 1839, the persecutions against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> broke out in Hou-P&eacute;, and Jean-Gabriel was one of the first victims. The events leading to his death bear a striking resemblance to the Passion and Death of Christ. A <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophyte</a>, like another <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>, betrayed Jean-Gabriel for thirty ounces of silver. He was stripped of his garments and clothed with rags, bound, and dragged from tribunal to tribunal. At each trial, he was treated inhumanly, tortured both in body and in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Finally, he was taken to Ou-Tchang-Fou, and after unparalleled tortures, was condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>. The sentence was ratified by an imperial edict, and on 11 September, 1840, Jean-Gabriel was led to death with seven criminals. The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was strangled to death on a cross.

<p>[Jean-Gabriel was declared Venerable by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> in July, 1843, <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> on 9 November, 1889, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by John Paul II on 2 June, 1996. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 11 September. &#151; <em>Ed.</em>]
