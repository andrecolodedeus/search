<h1>St. Jeanne de Valois</h1>  

<p>Queen and foundress of the Order of the Annonciades, b. 1464; d. at <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, 4 Feb., 1505. Daughter of one king and wife of another, there are perhaps few <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in the calendar who suffered greater or more bitter humiliations than did Madame J&eacute;hanne de France, the heroic <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> usually known in English as St. Jane of Valois. A daughter of Louis XI by his second wife, Charlotte of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, she was <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> from birth by her father, partly because of her sex and partly on account of her being sickly and deformed. Sent away to be brought up by guardians in a lonely country ch&#226;teau, and deprived not only of every advantage due to her rank, but even of common comforts and almost of necessities, it was the intense solitude and abjectness of her life that first made Jeanne turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for consolation, and that gave her very early a tender and practical <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to the Blessed Virgin</a>. She is said to have had a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> promise that some day she would be allowed to found a religious <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>. The mysteries of the Annunciation and Incarnation, as set forth in the Angelus, were her great delight.

<p>For political purposes of his own, Louis XI compelled Jeanne to marry Louis, Duke of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, his second cousin, and heir presumptive to the throne. After her marriage, the princess suffered even more than before, for the duke <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> the wife imposed upon him, and even publicly insulted her in every possible way. She, imagining virtues in her husband that did not exist, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> him tenderly, and when he got into disgrace and was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> exerted herself to mitigate his sufferings and to get him freed. No sooner, however, was the duke, on the death of Charles VIII, raised to the throne of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> as Louis XII, than he got his marriage with Jeanne annulled at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, on the ground that it was invalid, from lack of consent, and from the fact that it had never been consummated (see <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">ALEXANDER VI</a>); and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> humiliations reached their climax when she found herself, in the face of all <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> repudiated wife and queen.

<p>But the two special virtues in which Jeanne had resolved to imitate the Blessed Virgin were silence and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>; hence, though she <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravely</a> contested the matter while it was of any use, she accepted the verdict, when it came, without a complaint, merely thanking <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that it left her free to serve His Mother as she had always hoped to do, by founding an order for her service. She was made Duchess of Berry, and given that province to govern. Going to live at <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, its capital, she fulfilled all her <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as ruler with strict conscientiousness and tender care for her subjects' welfare. In 1500, in conjunction with her <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> director, Gilbert Nicolas, Jeanne founded the Order of the Annonciades, an order for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and penance, whose chief rule was to imitate the virtues of Mary, as shown in the Gospels. The rejected queen found <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> at last in devoting herself to this work; and towards the end of her life, she took the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> herself, gave up her wedding ring, which she had hitherto worn, and wore the habit under her clothes. In spite of bad health and constant suffering, she had done much bodily penance all her life, besides giving many hours to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Up to her death she <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> incessantly for her heartless husband, and left as a legacy to her order the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of constant <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as well as her father's and brother's.

<p>Jeanne died as she had lived, and was lamented by her spiritual daughters and all her people. Many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, especially of healing, followed her death. In 1514, <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> allowed the Annonciades to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> her by a special office. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> pronounced her Blessed, and extended her cult throughout <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; but, though the process of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> had been introduced in 1614, owing to various delays and hindrances, she has never been actually <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>, though universally known as a saint.
