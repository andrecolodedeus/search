<h1>St. Jerome Emiliani</h1>  

<p>Founder of the Order of Somascha; b. at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1481; d. at Somascha, 8 Feb., 1537; feast, 20 July; son of Angelo Emiliani (popularly called Miani) and of Eleonore Mauroceni, joined the army, and in 1508 defended Castelnuovo against the League of Cambray. Taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> liberated, he made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the shrine of Our Lady of <a href="../cathen/15038a.htm">Treviso</a>, in fulfillment of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. He was then appointed <em>podest&agrave;</em> of Castelnuovo, but after a short time returned to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> to supervise the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of his nephews. All his spare time was devoted to the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and to <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in 1518, the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and the hovels of the poor were his favourite resorts. In the year of plague and famine (1528), he seemed to be everywhere, and showed his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> especially for the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, whose number had so greatly increased. He rented a house for them near the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Rose and, with the assistance of some <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, ministered to their wants. To his charge was also committed the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for incurables, founded by St. Cajetan. In 1531 he went to <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> and induced the citizens to build a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>; at <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a> he erected an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>, at <a href="../cathen/02489c.htm">Bergamo</a> one for boys and another for girls. Here also he founded the first home for fallen <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who wished to do penance. Two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, Alessandro Besuzio and Agostino Bariso, now joined him in his labours of charity, and in 1532 Jerome founded a religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, placing the motherhouse at Somascha, a secluded hamlet between <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and <a href="../cathen/02489c.htm">Bergamo</a>. In the rule, Jerome puts down as the principal work of the community the care of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, poor, and sick, and demands that dwellings, food and clothing shall bear the mark of religious poverty. Jerome fell a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> to his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>; contracting a disease at <a href="../cathen/02489c.htm">Bergamo</a>, he died at Somascha. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> in 1747, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a> in 1767. The <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a> and <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> were approved eight years later. His biography was first written by Scipio Albani (1600); another by Andreas Stella (1605). The best was written by Aug. Tortora (Milan, 1620; in "Acta SS.", Feb., II, 217 sq.).

<p>After the death of Jerome his community was about to disband, but was kept together by Gambarana, who had been chosen superior. He obtained the approval (1540) of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>. In 1547 the members vainly sought affiliation with the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>; then in 1547-1555 they were united with the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a>. <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> (1563) approved the institution, and <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a> raised it to the dignity of a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, according to the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>, with solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicants</a>, and exemption. In 1569 the first six members made their profession, and Gambarana was made first superior general. Great favour was shown to the order by <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>, and he gave it the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Mayeul at <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, from which church the order takes its official name "Clerici regulares S. Majoli Papiae congregationis Somaschae". Later the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth was put into the programme of the order, and the colleges at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Pavia became renowned. It spread into <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and before the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">great Revolution</a> it had 119 houses in the four provinces of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. At present the order has ten houses in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> two of which are in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The general resides in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at S. Girolamo della Carita.
