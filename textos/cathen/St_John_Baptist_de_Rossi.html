<h1>St. John Baptist de Rossi</h1>  

<p>(De Rubeis).

<p>Born at Voltaggio in the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, 22 February, 1698; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 23 May, 1764; feast on 23 May. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, Charles de Rossi and Frances Anfossi, were not rich in earthly goods, but had solid <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and the esteem of their fellow-citizens. Of their four children, John excelled in gentleness and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. At the age of ten he was taken to <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> by friends for his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. There he received news of the death of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. After three years he was called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by a relative, Lorenzo de Rossi, who was canon at St. Mary in Cosmedin. He pursued his studies at the Collegium Romanum under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and soon became a model by his talents, application to study, and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. As a member of the Sodality of the Blessed Virgin and of the Ristretto of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve Apostles</a> established at the college, he led the members in the meetings and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> exercises, in visits to the sick in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and in other works of mercy, and merited even then the name of apostle. At the age of sixteen he entered the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> state. Owing to indiscreet practices of <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> he contracted spells of epilepsy, notwithstanding which he made his course of scholastic philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, and, with <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on 8 March, 1721. Having reached the desired goal, he bound himself by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to accept no <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> unless commanded by obedience. He fulfilled the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the sacred ministry by devoting himself to the labourers, herds, and teamsters of the Campagna, preaching to them early in the morning, or late in the evening, at the old Forum Romanum (Campo Vaccino), and by visiting, instructing, and assisting the poor at the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of <a href="../cathen/06348a.htm">St. Galla</a>. In 1731 he established near <a href="../cathen/06348a.htm">St. Galla</a> another <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> as a home of refuge for the unfortunates who wander the city by night ("Rom. Brev.", tr. <a href="../cathen/03089b.htm">Bute</a>, Summer, 573). In 1735 he became titular canon at St. Mary in Cosmedin, and, on the death of Lorenzo two years later, obedience forced him to accept the <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a>. The house belonging to it, however, he would not use, but employed the rent for good purposes.

<p>For a number of years John was afraid, on account of his sickness, to enter the confessional, and it was his custom to send to other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> the sinners whom he had brought to repentance by his instructions and sermons. In 1738 a dangerous sickness befell him, and to regain his health he went to Civit&agrave; Castellana, a day's journey from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the place induced him to hear <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a>, and after reviewing his <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> he received the unusual faculty of hearing <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a> in any of the churches of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He showed extraordinary <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in the exercise of this privilege, and spent many hours every day in hearing the confessions of the illiterate and the poor whom he sought in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and in their homes. He preached to such five and six times a day in churches, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, barracks, and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> cells, so that he became the apostle of the abandoned, a second Philip Neri, a hunter of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. In 1763, worn out by such labours and continued ill-health, his strength began to ebb away, and after several attacks of paralysis he died at his quarters in Trinit&agrave; de' Pellegrini. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in that church under a marble slab at the <a href="../cathen/01355b.htm">altar of the Blessed Virgin</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> his servant by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and only seventeen years after his death the process of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> was begun, but the troubled state of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> during the succeeding years prevented progress in the cause until it was resumed by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, who on 13 May, 1860, solemnly pronounced his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a>. As new signs still distinguished him, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, on 8 December, 1881, enrolled him among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.
