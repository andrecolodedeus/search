<h1>St. John Baptist de la Salle</h1>  

<p>Founder of the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> reformer, and father of modern pedagogy, was born at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, 30 April, 1651, and died at Saint-Yon, <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>, 7 April, 1719. The <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of de la Salle traces its origin to Johan Salla, who, in the early part of the ninth century, was Commander-in-chief of the Royal forces of Alfonso the Chaste. It was not, however, until about 1350 that the younger branch of this <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, from which our saint is descended, removed to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and settled in Champagne. John Baptist was the eldest child of Louis de la Salle and Nicolle de Moet de Brouillet. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were very solicitous in the care they bestowed upon their child, especially in regard to is moral and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> development. After due preparation, he was sent to the College des Bons Enfants, where he pursued the higher studies and, on 10 July, 1669, he took the degree of Master of Arts. Canon Pierre Dozet, chancellor of the University of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, was the presiding officer at the academic sessions, and in the discharge of his function had opportunity to study the character of his young cousin, de la Salle, with the result that he determined on resigning his <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> in his favour. Louis de la Salle, however, cherished the hope that John Baptist would select the profession of law, and thereby maintain the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> tradition. But young de la Salle insisted that he was called to serve the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and accordingly he received the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> 11 March, 1662, and was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> installed as a canon of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, 7 January, 1667.

<p>When de la Salle had completed his classical, literary, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> courses and had read the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a>, he was sent to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to enter the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice on 18 October, 1670. While residing here he attended the lectures in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>. There, under the direction of Louis Tronson, he made such rapid progress in virtue, that M. Lechassier, superior general of the Congregation of Saint-Sulpice, renders this testimony of him: "De la Salle was a constant observer of the rule. His conversation was always pleasing and above reproach. He seems never to have given offence to any one, nor to have incurred any one's censure." While at the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> de la Salle distinguished himself by his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> as well as by the vigour of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> progress and the ability with which he handled <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> subjects. Nine months after his arrival in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, his mother died, 19 July, 1671, and on 9 April, 1672, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> died. This circumstance <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> him to leave Saint-Sulpice, 19 April, 1672. He was now twenty-one, the head of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and as such had the responsibility of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educating</a> his brothers and sisters. His whole attention was devoted to his domestic affairs, and he provided for every circumstance by his discreet, businesslike administration. Canon Blain says that he underwent at this time many <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> struggles. Distrusting his own lights, de la Salle had recourse to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and the guidance of discreet advisers, among them, Nicolas Roland, canon and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, a man of great spiritual discernment. Acting upon the advice of the latter, the future founder was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> at <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, by Archbishop Ladislas Jonnart, 2 June, 1672.

<p>When not occupied with the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> or with his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies, he was engaged in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, under the guidance of his <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a>. After four years, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 21 March, 1676, by Fran&ccedil;ois Batailler, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a>. On this occasion de la Salle sought to obtain the permission of <a href="../cathen/09200c.htm">Maurice Le Tellier</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, to resign his <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> and prepare for <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> work. Nicolas Roland urged him to take this step, alleging that a rich <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> was little in harmony with youthful <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and activity. His <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, however refused his request. With <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> submission, de la Salle accepted the decision and returned to <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> to pursue his studies and to make final preparations for his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, on <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>, 9 April, 1678. The young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was a model of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and his biographers say that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> went to assist at his Mass to be edified, and to share his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. After Mass there were many who sought his counsel and put themselves under his spiritual guidance. De la Salle never omitted Holy Mass, save when prevented by sickness. In June, 1680, he submitted to his final examination and took his doctorate in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. At this period of his life de la Salle evinced a docility of spirit, a self-diffidence, that bespoke the character of the man and saint. In physical appearance he was of commanding presence, somewhat above the medium height, and well-proportioned. He had large, penetrating blue eyes and a broad forehead. His portraits present a picture of sweetness and dignity, beaming with intelligence and breathing an air of modesty and refined grace. A smile plays about the finely chiseled lips and illumines a countenance to which the large lustrous eyes give an air of commanding intelligence.

<p>During the few years that intervened between his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and the establishing of the institute, de la Salle was occupied in carrying out the last will and testament of Nicolas Roland, who, when dying, had confided to him the newly established Congregation of the Sisters of the Child Jesus. "Your zeal will bring it to prosperity", said Nicolas Roland to him. "You will complete the work which I have begun. In all this, Father Barre will be your model and guide." Thus was de la Salle imperceptibly drawn towards his life-work. "The idea never occurred to me", de la Salle wrote in a memoir. "If I had ever though that what I did out of pure charity for the poor <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> teachers would make it incumbent upon me to live with them, I would have given it up at once." This sentiment he again expressed towards the close of his life in these emphatic words: "If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had revealed to me the good that could be accomplished by this institute, and had likewise made known to me the trials and sufferings which would accompany it, my <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> would have failed me, and I would never have undertaken it." At this period de la Salle was still occupied with his functions as canon. He was, however, aroused to the higher calling by a message from Madame Maillefer, in March, 1679, requesting him to aid Adrien Nyel in opening a free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. But hardly had he succeeded in establishing the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of St-Maurice when he quietly withdrew from the work, as if it were not his mission. Shortly afterwards the opening of another free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in St-Jacques <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> lured him again from his seclusion, but he soon retired again.



<p>Although instrumental in opening these elementary free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, de la Salle seemed to allow Adrien Nyel to share all the honours resulting therefrom, while he was content to labour assiduously for the real progress of both <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. He was unconsciously attracted to the work. Daily he visited the teachers to encourage the or suggest practical methods to attain definite results. But when he found that the teachers became discouraged, owing to the lack of proper guidance after <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> hours, he undertook to house them, that he might be able to direct them and give them practical lessons in the useful employment of time, and to prevent weariness and disgust. Not only did he aid them in class and after class, but he made good any deficit in the cost of living. He even admitted them to his own table and later on sheltered them under his roof. Thus was he drawn closer and closer to them, forming an intimate fellowship with the teachers of the poor. "It was, indeed", says Mgr. Guibert, "his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that induced de la Salle to devote himself to the young teachers of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. They were like abandoned sheep without a shepherd. He assumed the responsibility of uniting them." As yet de la Salle had no definitive plans for the future, even as late as 2 June, 182, when he transferred his little community to the vicinity of rue Neuve. He simply kept himself in readiness to follow the guidance of Providence. He resigned his <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> in July, 1683, and he distributed his fortune to the poor in the winter of 1684, thus giving convincing <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> that he would not hesitate to make any <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to complete the good work he had begun. Pere Barre counselled de la Salle to give up whatever might divert his attention from procuring <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> glory. In reply to the earnest remonstrances of his friends and kinsfolk, he meekly answered: "I must do the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and if the worst should come to pass, we shall have to beg <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>." Reliance upon Providence was henceforth to be the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Schools</a>.

<p>Up to this period (1684) the institute had lacked the characteristics of a permanent organization. From 1694 to 1717, the struggle for existence was most critical. In 1692 the institute was so weakened by deaths and defections that de la Salle could hardly find two Brothers who were willing to bind themselves by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to maintain the free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The death of Henri L'Heureux in December, 1690, materially affected the rules of the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>. De la Salle, intending this gifted young Brother to be the future superior of the congregation, entertained the hope of having him <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and with this view he sent him to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to pursue his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>. After a brilliant course, Brother Henri L'Heureux was ready for <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, but before this event took place the young candidate fell sick and died. The loss of this Brother was a blow to the founder. After passing the whole night in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, he rose up, not only comforted but strengthened, but also enlightened as to the character of his future institute. He then determined that there should be no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> among the members of his institute. Although there were <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> in nearly all existing <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, de la Salle was convinced that the time had come for a change in this matter in the new congregation. Brother Lucard, the Annalist of the institute, thus sums up the matter: "Since the death of Henri L'Heureux, de la Salle was firmly convinced that his institute was to be founded on simplicity and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. No Brother could, without compromising his congregation, allow himself to be diverted from his functions as a teacher, by devoting himself to special studies, the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, or the fulfillment of other <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> on the sacred ministry." Therefore, no Brother can aspire to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> nor perform any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> function, and no ecclesiastic can become a member of the institute. This is the new rule that de la Salle added, and it is embodied in the Constitution of the institute.

<p>From 1702 the founder began to endure a long period of trial, aggravated by <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> on the part of certain <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>. In November, 1702, he was deposed by <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Cardinal de Noailles</a>, and supplanted for a time by the Rev. B. Bricot. In 1703 one of his most trusted disciples, Nicolas Vuyart, treacherously deserted him. For the next ten years the holy founded was engaged in a series of struggles for the preservation of his institute, in the course of which his name was attacked, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> denied him before the civil tribunals. After thirty-five years of hard labour, his work seemed to be almost on the verge of ruin. His confidence in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was so firm and unshaken that he was never really discouraged. In 171 he convoked a chapter for the purpose of solidifying the work and for the election of a superior general. His aim was to have a Brother elected during his lifetime and thus perfect the government of the institute in accordance with the rule he had formulated. The choice of the assembled Brothers fell upon Brother Barth&eacute;lemy, a man whom all esteemed for his learning and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. The institute was now an accomplished fact. And from the first interview with Adrien Nyel, in 1679, de la Salle belonged wholly to the Brothers, sharing with them the burden of labour and observing the common rule. He never left them to engage in other works.

<p>De la Salle was too prudent and too well inspired by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not to give his institute a positive character in its twofold object: the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth and the cultivation of that spirit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, and obedience which should characterize its members. His gift of gaining <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of leading them to make great <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, was supplemented by the splendid executive ability that enabled him to found an institute and to supervise and direct its gradual development. A study of the extraordinary religious, social, and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> conditions, at the time the institute was founded by de la Salle, will show the peculiar character of the difficulties he had to encounter and overcome. <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> had gained the ascendancy in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and spread broadcast its pernicious doctrines; it fostered internal dissensions and promoted Gallicanism, to the great detriment of the Faith and of loyalty to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In the social order, a spirit of exaggerated independence was abroad, condemning authority or thrusting it aside. When such conditions prevailed in the upper classes, one may well ask, what must have been the condition of the masses? The incessant foreign and internal <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, with their consequent evils, told with disastrous effect upon the people. Exorbitant demands on the part of army officials, the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the soldiery, the rapine of supervisors, the wholesale plunder of crops, followed by famine and ruin, left whole provinces of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> under the weight of terrible sufferings and untold misery. The peasants frequently had no bread, and when they had it the circumstances were such as to deprive them of any hope of sustenance for the morrow. Even when the gloom of internal turmoil had been momentarily brightened by the splendid victories abroad, the sad effect of the glory of the reign of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> made the mourning in cottages only the more bitter owing of the loss of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> ones on foreign battlefields. Evidently, <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> among the masses under these dire circumstances were threatened with ruin, as were the social and <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> conditions; for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrines</a> were spread and took hold among the people, destroying their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and stultifying their consciences. Schools there were, but they were poorly attended and shamefully neglected. The children and the people generally were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, and vice, according to contemporary authorities, was rampant among all classes. De la Salle carefully studied these conditions and, moved to compassion for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, resolved to improve their social and moral status. The founder grasped the situation and proposed as a remedy, popular free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> thoroughly graded and supplied with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> teachers, who would implant in the hearts of the children the germs of those virtues that would tend towards the regeneration of both the pupils and the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. He saw that a religious congregation composed of enlightened men, eager for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, could alone stem the tide of irreligion, vice, and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. He clearly perceived that, in the peculiar conditions which surround any institute at the period of its origin, the work proposed to be done should embody in its ends the special requirements of the age in which it originates. He also foresaw that, while the guiding spirit of such an institute must ever remain fundamentally the same, its scope, as a permanent organization working for the welfare of humanity, should have the character of a social force answering to the needs and conditions of any age and country.

<p>The various <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> reforms which de la Salle introduced prove that he legislated wisely. The courses of study for elementary free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, technical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and colleges are evidences of his broad culture and wide grasp of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> problems. Hence, if the needs of a certain locality called for special branches, or if the times and conditions demanded certain advanced studies, de la Salle was not slow in responding nor in giving these subjects a place commensurate in importance with their <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> value. De la Salle, furthermore, displayed his genius in giving is institute a distinctive character, that of a teaching body, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the work of popular <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Thus he became the author of a system of psychologic pedagogy which included the essential principles adopted by later workers in the field of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> reforms, notably by <a href="../cathen/11742b.htm">Pestalozzi</a>, Fr&ouml;bel, Herbart, and others. In making the vernacular the basis of all instruction, de la Salle appealed to the intelligence of the child, prepared the way for the study of national literature, and opened up to the grown man those avenues of real <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and delight that had hitherto been closed against the eager multitude. With <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> scientific insight he perceived the absurdity of retaining Latin texts to teach the art of reading. For this change he gave the following reasons: <ul> <li>The teaching of the art of reading, in primary and elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, through the vernacular, is of greater and wider utility than by Latin texts. <li>The vernacular is more easily taught to children, who already possess some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it, than the Latin of which they are wholly <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. <li>It requires considerably less time to learn the art of reading through the vernacular than through a foreign tongue. <li>The boys and girls attending the primary and elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, can spend only a few years under instruction. Now, if thy are taught reading from a Latin text, they generally leave <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> without being able to read the vernacular, and with only an imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of how to read the Latin. Hence, they will soon forget the little they have learned, and, perhaps, even how to read the vernacular. <li>Reading is one of he most efficacious means of acquiring <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. With due care in the selection of books, children who can read in the vernacular could spread the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> circle, and, on evenings, read some useful or instructive books to the assembled household; whereas, if they could read the Latin only, without understanding it, they would be deprived of many valuable benefits resulting from the intelligent reading of a good book. <li>It is impossible for children in primary and elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> to master the reading of Latin texts, because they are not acquainted with its subject matter. It is, therefore, the part of wisdom to train children thoroughly to the intelligent reading of works written in the vernacular. Thus, having mastered the art of reading in the vernacular, a few months would suffice to make them read the Latin fluently, whereas, if the traditional method were followed, it would require at least several years [Annales de l'Institut, I (1883), pp. 140, 141]. </ul> This fact proves that de la Salle was a profound thinker, a genius in the work of popular <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. He embraced all classes, all conditions of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. By making the free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> popular, he grasped the growing needs of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> in his own day and for all times. No phase of the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> problem escaped his penetrating vision.

<p>As de la Salle is especially identified with the "Simultaneous Method" of teaching, an explanation of the method and its history will prove of interest to the educator. By the "Simultaneous Method" the pupils are graded according to their capacity, putting those of equal attainments in the same class, giving them the same text-books, and requiring them to follow the same lesson under one and the same teacher. This method has best stood the test of time and experience, and is that which the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a> employ in all grades of instruction even at the present day. Like all fruitful <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, the "Simultaneous Method" is not the exclusive <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of any one man. Others besides de la Salle discerned its value, and even partially applied its essential principles, long before the founder of the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Schools</a> made it live in his institute. It had no place in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> system of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. The plan adopted n those time was that which prevails to a great extent in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of our own day, namely, listening to lectures, taking notes thereon, and holding disputations upon the subject-matter. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> organized each class in subdivisions; each division being headed by an advanced pupil called a <em>decurion</em>, to whom the boys recited their lessons at stated times, while the teacher corrected exercises or heard the lessons of particular pupils. The whole class afterwards received explanations form the teacher. <a href="../cathen/11767b.htm">St. Peter Fourier</a> (1565-1640) saw in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> the remedy for many of the disorders existing among the poor and labouring class. He was far-seeing, and anticipated more than one of our modern <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> improvements. Indeed, he was one of the first to apply some of the principles of the "Simultaneous Method". In his constitutions he prescribes that, as far as it can possibly be carried out, all the pupils of the same mistress shall have each the same book, in order to learn and read therein the same lesson; so that, whilst one is reading hers in an audible and intelligible voice before the mistress, all the others, hearing her and following this lesson in their books at the same time, may earn it sooner, more readily, and more perfectly. Herein the principle of the "Simultaneous Method" is for the first time, clearly stated. Yet, when he enters into the details of practice he seems to lose sight of the principle which he lays down. In the very next paragraph of the Constitutions, it is provided that the mistress shall call up two pupils at a time, and place them one at each side of her desk. The more advanced pupil shall read her lesson; the other shall listen to her, shall correct all the faults she may make, in the use of words, in pronunciation, or in the observance of pauses. This is the individual method. For the smaller pupils he recommends that four or six at a time come to her desk, and to make use of some graded cards, containing letters and syllables. (Sommaire des Constitutions des Religieuses de la Congr&eacute;gation de Notre-Dame, 1649, 3rd part.)

<p>Cornelius (or Amos Komensky, 1592-1674), in his "Didactica Magna", requires the teacher to instruct his pupils <em>semel et omnes simul</em>, "all together at one and the same time" (edit. 1647, cap. xix, Probl. I, Col, 102, 103). Mgr. de Nesmond (1629-1715) divided the class into four or five groups, each having the same book, "in order that all the children of the same group or bench may receive the same lesson, and when one begins to read, the others are to read in a low voice at the same time" (M&eacute;thode pour instruire en peu de temps les Enfants, p. 59). About 1674, Charles D&eacute;mia, of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, adopted the method of Mgr. de Nesmond. Life him, he gave the same reading-book to each group, requiring that each one follow, holding his finger or a marker on the words that are being read. The immediate precursor of St. John Baptist de la Salle was a theorist, the anonymous author of "Avis touchant les Petites Exoles" (Bibl. Nat., 40 R. 556). In this little work, which Leopold Delisle places prior to 1680, the author complains of the condition of the primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and proposes a method by which a large number of pupils might be taught, by one teacher, one book, and one voice. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, he tells us, should be so regulated that one and the same book, one and the same teacher, one and the same lesson, one and the same correction, should serve for all, so that each pupil would thereby possess his teacher wholly and entirely, and occupy all his care, all his time, and all his attention, as if he were the only pupil (pp. 14 and 19). It is reasonable to presume that de la Salle frequented the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> taught by the Congregation of Notre-Dame, which were founded at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> in 1634, and observed the method of teaching employed in that congregation. We can have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he was equally well acquainted with the defects which rendered such methods useless. In 1682 de la Salle had organized the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>, and had given them the "Simultaneous Method". <a href="../cathen/02166c.htm">Brother Azarias</a> says: "What <a href="../cathen/11767b.htm">St. Peter Fourier</a> touched, what Komensky and Mgr. de Nesmond and Charles D&eacute;mia had glimmerings of, what the anonymous author could nowhere find and thought to realize, had become a fact". De la Salle applied the Simultaneous Method not only to reading, as was done by his predecessors, but also to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>, writing, spelling, and arithmetic in the elementary classes, and then to all the specialties taught in the colleges which he founded. He is, therefore, the genius who introduced and perfected the Simultaneous Method in all its practical details. De la Salle definitely points out the "Simultaneous Method" as the one which he wished his disciples to follow. It is no longer the one teacher governing a whole <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; it is two or three, or more, according to the number of pupils, each taking those of the same capacity and teaching them together. His instructions on these heads are exact: <blockquote> The Brothers shall pay special attention to three things in class: (1) During the lessons, to correct every word that the pupil who is reading pronounces badly; (2) To make all who read in the same lesson to follow therein; (3) To have silence strictly observed in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. (Common Rules) </blockquote>

<p>The pupils follow in the same lesson, they observe strict silence, the teacher in correcting one, is correcting all. Here is the essence of the "Simultaneous Method". De la Salle generalizes the principles for all lessons, thus: <blockquote> in all the lessons from alphabet-cards, syllabaries, and other books, whether French or Latin, and even during arithmetic, while one reads, all the others of the same lesson shall follow; that is, they shall read to themselves from their books without making noises with their lips, what the one reading pronounces aloud from his book. (Conduite des ecoles chr&eacute;tiennes, Avignon, 1724) </blockquote>

<p>With <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has Matthew Arnold said, in speaking of this handbook of Method: "Later works on the same subject have little improved the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>, while they entirely lack the unction." In the management of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, de la Salle states concisely the following practical rules for teaching methodically: <blockquote> 1. The teacher determines the relative intelligence of every pupil in his class. 2. He adapts his language and explanations to the capacity of his class, and is careful never to neglect the duller pupils. 3. He makes sure that the pupils <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the meaning of the words they employ. 4. He advances from the simple to the complex, from the easy to the difficult. 5. He makes it a special point to insist greatly on the elementary part of each subject; not to advance until the pupils are well grounded on what goes before . . . 9. To state but few principles at a time, but to explain them well . . . 10. To speak much to the eyes of the pupils, making sue of the blackboard . . . 11. To prepare every lesson carefully. 12. To place no faulty models or standards before the pupils; always to speak to them in a sensible manner, expressing one's self in correct language, good English, and with clearness and precision. 13. To employ none but exact definitions and well-founded divisions . . . 18. To assert nothing without being positively certain of its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, especially as regards facts, definitions, or principles. 19. To make frequent use of the system of question and answer. (Chap. V, art. ii, pp. 31-33) </blockquote>

<p>It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that de la Salle, in establishing his institute, had in mind principally the primary and elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, which was the real raison d'etre for the existence of the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>. He was the organizer of the public instruction of his time, and no master of pedagogical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> will deny him that distinction. But, if the primary and elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was the principal masterwork of de la Salle, there was yet another field of labour which likewise reveals his creative genius. At the opening of the eighteenth century, he was confronted with singularly perplexing conditions. The rising generation was weary of past glories, disgusted with the present and was ambitious to achieve renown in hitherto unexplored fields of activity. As <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was gradually extending to the masses, with the light of instruction came new <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, new occupations, new ventures, and a breaking away from the old civilization, with the desire to wrestle with the problems born of the new conditions. Even those who were trained in traditional methods became aware of a mighty change in men and things. They felt that there was a desideratum in the actual <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> system. With their sons, they experienced the world-spirit breathing upon the moribund civilization of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>. The political horizon had changed, <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> became more degenerate, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> world was awakened and cast off its lethargy, assuming a bolder attitude and aspiring to greater freedom in the realm of thought and research. De la Salle had been struck with the serious hiatus in the instruction reserved for the wealthy children, who were destined for the liberal professions. So, while organizing the primary and elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, he also created, in 1705, a special establishment until then unknown in the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> world. This new creation was the boarding college at Saint-Yon, wherein he inaugurated the system of modern secondary instruction. Saint-Yon became the type of all such colleges, and that of Passy, Paris, became the modern exemplar of similar institutions in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and elsewhere. M. Drury, in his report upon technical <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, states that <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> is indebted to de la Salle for the practical installation and popularization of that form of instruction.

<p>Hence, from the origin of the institute, there was a constant adaptation of programmes to the needs created by the social transformations which were taking place. This flexibility, which contrasted with the fixedness of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> programmes, excited surprise and no little opposition among the representatives of academic authority in those days. The instruction given in the college founded by de la Salle and his successors was peculiarly adapted of the needs of a very interesting class of young men. The <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> reforms thus planned and carried out by him give unmistakable evidence that Providence had raised him up to be the lawgiver of primary and elementary teaching, as well as the creator of a new system of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> training, combining the precision of the traditional method with the wider scope of the new one. It was but natural that de la Salle, who had assimilated the best that the seventeenth century could give, and who had become cognizant of the inefficiency of the old system to meet the requirements of the new conditions, should create <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> which were then, and have been since, the admiration of educators. The boarding colleges founded by de la Salle for the modern secondary instruction are, therefore, a distinct creation. The date of the Saint-Yon college is 1705. He later added a technical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> to develop the mechanical skill of the students, and also a special garden for botany.

<p>There were Sunday <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> prior to the seventeenth century. But the Christian Academy, founded by de la Salle for adults in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Saint-Sulpice, in 1699, was of a different character, the first of its kind in the history of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The programme of this academy, or Sunday <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, included not only the ordinary branches taught in the other Sunday <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, but it added geometry, architecture, and drawing.

<p>Alain claims that the first normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were the novitiates of the teaching orders. But there were no normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for lay teachers. De la Salle had been frequently asked by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to send a Brother to take charge of their <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. This request was refused, for he had established the rule that not less than two Brothers teach in any <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Accordingly, he offered to open a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for teachers, an institution in which young men would be trained in the principles and practices of the new method of teaching. The normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was opened at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> in 1684. Indeed, thirteen years before Francke organized his teachers' class at Halle, and fifty years before <a href="../cathen/07186a.htm">Hecker</a> founded the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> normal college at Stettin, de la Salle had given a programme which is even today deemed excellent. In the same year he established for youths who were destined to enter the brotherhood, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> academy, or preparatory <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, in which they were taught the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, literature, and the principles of scientific pedagogy.

<p>De la Salle is entitled to be ranked among the advanced educators of the eighteenth century and among the greatest thinkers and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> reformers of all time. His system embraces the best in the modern <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> methods. He gave an impetus to the higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> progress which is the distinctive mark of modern times, and bequeathed to is own disciples, and to educators in general, a system of teaching which is adaptable to the wants of school-going youth in every country. But it was especially as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> that John Baptist de la Salle <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> his vocation as an educator. Like <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius Loyola</a>, he taught letters that he might have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to teach <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>. In claiming this privilege de la Salle was actuated by the highest and purest motives. There was nothing narrow in his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> plans. He was too wise not to realize the necessity that the truest and best children of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should be among the most skilled in human affairs. His view was from the summit, therefore, broad and comprehensive. Intellectual training was supplemented by a complete course of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. Man had a destiny, and the teacher was to inculcate this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by cultivating and developing the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> virtues in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the children.

<p>This thought seemed to be uppermost in the mind and to haunt the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of de la Salle, when he drew up those excellent programmes for his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, colleges, and technical institutions. His pedagogic principle was that nothing human should be foreign to the students, and the teaching of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and letters appeared to him to take nothing from the teacher in his ministry as an apostle. In September, 1713, <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> issued the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a>, condemning the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a>, culled from his "Moral Reflections". M. de Montmartin, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> in a circular letter, in February, 1714. De la Salle was then making a retreat at Parmenie. When he left this place, he entered the arena to defend the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>. He assembled the Brothers of <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a> and explained the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, in order to safeguard the purity of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Not satisfied with this manifestation of loyalty, he published several articles in defence of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. This irritated the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, but their opposition only served to give greater lustre to the purity of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. He was a fearless and uncompromising champion, and he seemed to forget his habitual calm and reserve when there was question of the integrity and purity of the Faith. To show his inviolable attachment to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and to the Sovereign Pontiff, he always signed himself <em>Roman Priest.</em> "Hold fast to what is of faith", he writes to the Brothers; "shun novelties; follow the traditions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; receive only what she receives; condemn what she condemns; approve what she approves, either by her Councils or by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiffs</a>. In all things render her prompt obedience". He was even eager to go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to cast himself at the feet of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and request his blessing for the institute. However, not being able to go himself, he sent Brother Gabriel Drolin to establish a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> there in 1700. Even the consolation of seeing his rule approved by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> was denied the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, for he had been dead nearly six years when, on 26 February, 1725, <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, by his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "In apostolicae dignitatis solio", placed the seal of <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> upon the institute, empowering the members to teach and explain <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>, and constituting them a religious congregation.

<p>The last years of de la Salle were spent in close retirement at Saint-Yon. There he revised his rule before giving it to Brother Barth&eacute;lemy, the first superior general. During the last days of his life he showed the same spirit of sacrifice which had marked his earlier years. In <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a> of 1719, he gave unmistakable signs that the end was near. On <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a>, at the request of Brother Barth&eacute;lemy, he blessed the Brothers assembled at his bedside, and gave them his last words of counsel. His final words were: "In all things I adore the will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in my regard." On <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> morning, 7 April, 1719, he breathed his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into the hands of his Creator. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> on 24 May 1900. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 15 May.

<p>The principal writings which he has bequeathed to his spiritual children are: "Conduite des &eacute;coles" (1717), a treatise on pedagogic method, presenting fundamental principles in a scientific manner. It is remarkable that the methods herein given have not been considerably changed since the time of its author, and that the principles laid down are as applicable today as when they were written. Les R&egrave;gles de la biens&eacute;ance et de la civilit&eacute; chr&eacute;tiennes", is a volume written in 1695, and used as a treatise on politeness and as a text in the reading of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. The style is simple and direct. It contains excellent rules for cultured manners. Les devoirs du chr&eacute;tien" (73), a simple and precise exposition of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> is remarkable for its accuracy, and for the practical lessons it inculcates. It was intended as a reader and a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>. It still retains its place in many <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and colleges. "Recueil de diff&eacute;rents petits trait&eacute;s &agrave; Pusage des Fr&egrave;res des Ecoles chr&eacute;tiennes" (1711) is a noteworthy treatise, stating in remarkably simple terms the fundamental principles of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. It abounds in Scriptural quotations and is a valuable guide for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> striving after perfection. "Explication de la m&eacute;thode d'oraison" (1st printed ed., 1739). In point of clearness and adaptation, this method of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is eminently suited to the needs of the Brothers. It appeals to every degree of capacity, for all can find therein the spiritual food <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for their special condition and state of perfection. "M&eacute;ditations pour le temps de la Retraite" (1st printed ed. 1730), written for the exercises of the annual retreat, and, combining he principles of the spiritual life with pedagogics, tends to promote the Christian Apostolate in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. These m&eacute;ditations contain some of the soundest principles of pedagogy ever enunciated. "Meditations pour tous les Dimanches de Pan&eacute;e, avec les Evangiles de tous les Dimanches; Meditations pour les principales fetes de Panee" (Rouen, 1710?), is an epitome of spiritual <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, based upon the Gospels of the year and applied to the needs of the teaching profession and the principles of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. This treatise reveals the greatness of de la Sale and shows him to be a man of deep religious conviction. His language is always simple, direct, and vigorous.

<p>The spirit of de la Salle has even permeated other religious <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, either in giving them a special character or suggesting their rules. Thus, the <a href="../cathen/06330b.htm">Brothers of St. Gabriel</a>, founded by Blessed Grignon de Montfort and M. Deshayes, in 1795 and 1821; The <a href="../cathen/03711c.htm">Brothers of Christian Instruction</a> of Plo&euml;rmel, founded by <a href="../cathen/08765a.htm">J.-M. de Lamennais</a>, in 1816; The Brothers of Christian Doctrine of <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a>, founded by Father Fr&eacute;chard, in 1817; The <a href="../cathen/09749c.htm">Little Brothers of Mary</a> (Marists), founded by P&egrave;re Champagnat, in 1817; The <a href="../cathen/13305a.htm">Brothers of the Sacred Heart</a> of Paradis, founded by Father Coindre, in 1821; The Brothers of the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Society of Mary</a>, founded by P&egrave;re Chaminade, in 1817; The Brothers of the Holy Family, founded by Brother Gabriel Taborin, in 1821; The <a href="../cathen/04539b.htm">Brothers of the Cross of Jesus</a>, founded by P&egrave;re Bochard, in 1824; The <a href="../cathen/15399a.htm">Clerics of St-Viateur</a>, founded by P&egrave;re Guerbes, in 1829; The <a href="../cathen/07403a.htm">Congregation of the Holy Cross</a>, founded by M. Moreau and M. Dujarris, in 1835; The <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Congregation of the Holy Ghost</a> and the Sacred Heart of Mary, founded by Father Liebermann, in 1841; The Brothers of Mercy, founded by M. Delamare, in 1842; The <a href="../cathen/03710b.htm">Christian Brothers of Ireland</a>, founded by Brother Ignatius Rice, in 1805; and the Institute of the Sisters of the Christian Schools of Mercy, founded by Ven. Julie Postel, in 1802-all exemplify in the character of their work and in the rules adopted, a striking similarity to the methods and aims proposed by Saint John Baptist de la Salle in founding the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>.
