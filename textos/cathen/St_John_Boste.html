<h1>St. John Boste</h1>  

<p>(Or JOHN BOAST.)

<p><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, b. of good <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> at Dufton, in Westmoreland, about 1544; d. at <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, 24 July, 1594. He studied at Queen's College, Oxford, 1569-72, became a Fellow, and was received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at Brome, in Suffolk, in 1576. Resigning his Fellowship in 1580, he went to <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 4 March, 1581, and in April was sent to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. He landed at Hartlepool and became a most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> missioner, so that the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a> made extraordinary efforts to capture him. At last, after many narrow escapes, he was taken to Waterhouses, the house of William Claxton, near <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, betrayed by one Eglesfield [or Ecclesfield], 5 July, 1593. The place is still visited by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. From Durham he was conveyed to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, showing himself throughout "resolute, bold, joyful, and pleasant", although terribly racked in the Tower. Sent back to Durham for the July Assizes, 1594, he behaved with undaunted <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and resolution, and induced his fellow-martyr, Bl. George Swalwell [or Swallowell], a <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">convert</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a>, who had recanted through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, to repent of his cowardice, <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolving</a> him publicly in court. He suffered at Dryburn, outside Durham. He recited the <a href="../cathen/01486b.htm">Angelus</a> while mounting the ladder, and was executed with extraordinary brutality; for he was scarcely turned off the ladder when he was cut down, so that he stood on his feet, and in that posture was cruelly butchered alive. An account of his trial and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">execution</a> was written by an eye-witness, <a href="../cathen/13099b.htm">Venerable Christopher Robinson</a>, who suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> shortly afterwards at <a href="../cathen/03349b.htm">Carlisle</a>.

<p class="stiki"><em>Note:</em> In 1970, John Boste was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Pope Paul VI among the Forty Martyrs of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, whose joint <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a> is kept on 25 October.</p>
