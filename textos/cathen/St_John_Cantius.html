<h1>St. John Cantius</h1>  

<p>Born at Kenty, near Oswiecim, Diocese of Krakow, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, 1412 (or 1403); died at <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Krakow</a>, 1473, and was buried there under the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Anne; his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is on 20 October. He was the son of Stanislaus and Anne who were <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> country people; he received his primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at his native town, and then being sent by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to the Academy of Krakow, he soon impressed his professors and colleagues with his pleasant and amiable disposition; always <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, but serious, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, and godly, he won the hearts of all who came in contact with him. Having made excellent progress in the study of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, he was graduated first as <a href="../cathen/01756c.htm">bachelor</a>, then as master and doctor, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and then appointed professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the Academy of Krakow, from where he was sent, after a short time, by his superiors to Olkusz, Diocese of Krakow, to be <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Being afraid of the great responsibility of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> work, he very soon left the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, and was again appointed professor of Sacres Scripture at the Academy of Krakow, which position he held without interruption until his death. As testified by Michael Miechowita, the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Polish historian and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> first biographer, extreme <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and charity were conspicuous in his life; he took as his motto: <blockquote>Conturbare cave: non est placare suave, <br>Infamare cave; nam revocare grave.</blockquote>

<p>He distributed to the poor all the money and clothes he had, retaining only what was absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to support himself. He slept but little, and on the floor, ate very sparingly, and was a total abstainer from meat after he became a doctor. He made one <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Jerusalem with the desire of becoming a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> among the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, and four <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on foot. During his life he performed various <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, which were multiplied after his death at his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a> in 1767. The <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> distinguishes him with three <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>; he is the only confessor not a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who is thus <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a>.
