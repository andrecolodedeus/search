<h1>St. John Capistran</h1>  

<p>Born at Capistrano, in the Diocese of Sulmona, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 1385; died 23 October, 1456. His father had come to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> in the train of Louis of Anjou, hence is supposed to have been of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> blood, though some say he was of German origin. His father dying early, John owed his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> to his mother. She had him at first instructed at home and then sent him to study <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at <a href="../cathen/11737a.htm">Perugia</a>, where he achieved great success under the eminent legist, Pietro de Ubaldis. In 1412 he was appointed governor of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> by Ladislaus, King of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, who then held that city of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. As governor he set himself against civic corruption and <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribery</a>. <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">War</a> broke out in 1416 between <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09566a.htm">Malatesta</a>. John was sent as ambassador to propose peace to the <a href="../cathen/09566a.htm">Malatesta</a>, who however cast him into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. It was during this <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> that he began to think more seriously about his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. He decided eventually to give up the world and become a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">Friar</a>, owing to a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> he had in which he saw <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a> and was warned by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> to enter the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>. John had <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> a <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">lady</a> of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> immediately before the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> broke out, but as the <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriage</a> was not consummated he obtained a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> to enter <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religion</a>, which he did 4 October, 1416.

<p>After he had taken his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> he came under the influence of <a href="../cathen/02505b.htm">St. Bernardine of Siena</a>, who taught him <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>: he had as his fellow-student <a href="../cathen/08278b.htm">St. James of the Marches</a>. He accompanied <a href="../cathen/02505b.htm">St. Bernardine</a> on his preaching tours in order to study his methods, and in 1420, whilst still in <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> orders, was himself permitted to preach. But his apostolic life began in 1425, after he had received the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. From this time until his death he laboured ceaselessly for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. He traversed the whole of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; and so great were the crowds who came to listen to him that he often had to preach in the public squares. At the time of his preaching all business stopped. At <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a> on one occasion he preached to a crowd of one hundred and twenty-six thousand people, who had come from all the neighbouring provinces. On another occasion during a <a href="../cathen/10391a.htm">mission</a>, over two thousand sick people were brought to him that he might sign them with the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the Cross</a>, so great was his fame as a healer of the sick. Like <a href="../cathen/02505b.htm">St. Bernardine of Siena</a> he greatly propagated <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">Holy Name of Jesus</a>, and, together with that <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, was accused of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> because of this <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a>. While he was thus carrying on his apostolic work, he was actively engaged in assisting <a href="../cathen/02505b.htm">St. Bernardine</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12711a.htm">reform</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>. In 1429 John, together with other <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Observant</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, was <a href="../cathen/03791a.htm">cited</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on the charge of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and he was chosen by his companions to defend their cause; the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> were acquitted by the commission of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>.

<p>After this, <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Pope Martin V</a> conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of uniting the <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventual Friars Minor</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Observants</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/06412b.htm">general chapter</a> of both bodies of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> was convoked at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a> in 1430. A union was effected, but it did not last long. The following year the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Observants</a> held a chapter at Bologna, at which John was the moving spirit. According to Gonzaga, John was about this time appointed <a href="../cathen/04164b.htm">commissary general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Observants</a>, but his <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">name</a> does not appear among the <a href="../cathen/04164b.htm">commissaries</a> and <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars</a> in Holzapfel's list (<em>Manuale Hist. Ord. FF. Min.</em>, 624-5) before 1443. But it was owing to him that <a href="../cathen/02505b.htm">St. Bernardine</a> was appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> in 1438. Shortly after this, whilst visiting <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> he met <a href="../cathen/04099b.htm">St. Colette</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12711a.htm">reformer</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Second Franciscan Order</a> or <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, with whose efforts he entirely sympathized. He was frequently employed on embassies by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In 1439 he was sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, to oppose the claims of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/06031b.htm">Felix V</a>; in 1446 he was on a mission to the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; in 1451 he went at the request of the emperor as <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">Apostolic nuncio</a> to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. During the period of his <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nunciature</a> John visited all parts of the empire, preaching and combatting the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a>; he also visited <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> at the request of Casimir IV. In 1454 he was summoned to the Diet at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, to assist that assembly in its deliberation concerning a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> for the relief of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>: and here, too, he was the leading spirit. When the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> was actually in operation John accompanied the famous <a href="../cathen/07564b.htm">Hunyady</a> throughout the campaign: he was present at the battle of <a href="../cathen/02407a.htm">Belgrade</a>, and led the left wing of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> army against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> in 1694, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1724. He wrote many books, chiefly against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of his day.
