<h1>St. John Fisher</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rochester, and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>; born at <a href="../cathen/02540b.htm">Beverley</a>, Yorkshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 1459 (?1469); died 22 June, 1535.

<p>John was the eldest son of Robert Fisher, merchant of <a href="../cathen/02540b.htm">Beverley</a>, and Agnes his wife. His early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was probably received in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> attached to the <a href="../cathen/04114a.htm">collegiate</a> church in his native town, whence in 1484 he removed to Michaelhouse, <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>. He took the <a href="../cathen/01756c.htm">degree of B.A.</a> in 1487, proceeded <a href="../cathen/01759a.htm">M.A.</a> in 1491, in which year he was elected a fellow of his <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, and was made <a href="../cathen/15401a.htm">Vicar</a> of Northallerton, Yorkshire. In 1494 he resigned his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> to become proctor of his <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and three years later was appointed Master of Michaelhouse, about which <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> he became <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> and confessor to <a href="../cathen/02376a.htm">Margaret Beaufort</a>, Countess of <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a> and Derby, mother of King Henry VII. In 1501 he received the degree of D.D., and was elected Vice-Chancellor of <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge University</a>. Under Fisher's guidance, the Lady Margaret founded St. John's and Christ's Colleges at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>, and also the two "Lady Margaret" professorships of divinity at Oxford and Cambridge respectively, Fisher himself being the first occupant of the Cambridge chair.

<p>By <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 14 October, 1504, Fisher was advanced to the Bishopric of Rochester, and in the same year was elected Chancellor of <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge University</a>, to which post he was re-elected annually for ten years and then appointed for life. At this <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> also he is said to have acted as tutor to Prince Henry, afterwards <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>. As a preacher his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> was so great that in 1509, when King Henry VII and the Lady Margaret died, Fisher was appointed to preach the funeral oration on both occasions; these <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> are still extant. In 1542 Fisher was <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nominated</a> as one of the English representatives at the Fifth Council of Lateran, then sitting, but his journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was postponed, and finally abandoned. Besides his share in the Lady Margaret's foundations, Fisher gave further <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his genuine <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for learning by inducing <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> to visit Cambridge. The latter indeed (Epist., 6:2) attributes it to Fisher's protection that the study of Greek was allowed to proceed at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a> without the active molestation that it encountered at Oxford. He has also been named, though without any real <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> author of the royal treatise against <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> entitled "Assertio septem sacramentorum", published in 1521, which won the title <em>Fidei Defensor</em> for <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>. Before this <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> Fisher had <a href="../cathen/04733b.htm">denounced</a> various abuses in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, urging the need of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">disciplinary</a> reforms, and in this year he preached at St. Paul's Cross on the occasion when <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> books were publicly burned.

<p>When the question of Henry's <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> from Queen Catherine arose, Fisher became the Queen's chief supporter and most trusted counsellor. In this capacity he appeared on the Queen's behalf in the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates'</a> court, where he startled his hearers by the directness of his language and most of all by declaring that, like <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>, he was ready to die on behalf of the indissolubility of marriage. This statement was reported to <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, who was so enraged by it that he himself composed a long Latin address to the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> in answer to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> speech. Fisher's copy of this still exists, with his <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> annotations in the margin which show how little he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">feared</a> the royal <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. The removal of the cause to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> brought Fisher's personal share therein to an end, but the king never forgave him for what he had done. In November, 1529, the "Long Parliament" of Henry's reign began its series of encroachments on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Fisher, as a member of the upper house, at once warned Parliament that such acts could only end in the utter destruction of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. On this the Commons, through their speaker, complained to the king that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had disparaged Parliament. Dr. Gairdner (<em>Lollardy and the Reformation</em>, I, 442) says of this incident "it can hardly be a matter of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that this strange remonstrance was prompted by the king himself, and partly for personal uses of his own".

<p>The opportunity was not lost. <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry</a> summoned Fisher before him, demanding an explanation. This being given, Henry declared himself satisfied, leaving it to the Commons to declare that the explanation was inadequate, so that he appeared as a magnanimous sovereign, instead of Fisher's enemy.

<p>A year later (1530) the continued encroachments on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> moved the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishops</a> of Rochester, <a href="../cathen/02347a.htm">Bath</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a> to <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appeal</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Apostolic see</a>. This gave the king his opportunity. An edict forbidding such <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appeals</a> was immediately issued, and the three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were arrested. Their <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, however, can have lasted a few months only, for in February, 1531, Convocation met, and Fisher was present. This was the occasion when the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were forced, at a cost of 1000,000 pounds, to purchase the king's pardon for having recognized <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Cardinal Wolsey's</a> authority as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; and at the same <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> to acknowledge Henry as Supreme Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, to which phrase, however, the addition "so far as <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a> permits" was made, through Fisher's efforts.

<p>A few days later, several of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> servants were taken ill after eating some porridge served to the household, and two actually died. Popular opinion at the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> regarded this as an attempt on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>, although he himself chanced not to have taken any of the poisoned food. To disarm suspicion, the king not only expressed strong indignation at the crime, but <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> a special Act of Parliament to be passed, whereby poisoning was to be accounted <a href="../cathen/15026b.htm">high treason</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> guilty of it boiled to death. This <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentence</a> was actually carried out on the culprit, but it did not prevent what seems to have been a second attempt on Fisher's <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> soon afterwards.

<p>Matters now moved rapidly. In May, 1532, <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">Sir Thomas More</a> resigned the chancellorship, and in June, Fisher preached publicly against the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>. In August, <a href="../cathen/15554a.htm">Warham</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, died, and Cranmer was at once <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nominated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as his successor. In January, 1533, Henry <a href="../cathen/04001a.htm">secretly</a> went through the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> of marriage with Anne Boleyn; Cranmer's <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> took place in March of the same year, and, a week later, Fisher was arrested. It seems fairly clear that the purpose of this arrest was to prevent his opposing the <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentence</a> of <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> which Cranmer pronounced in May, or the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of Anne Boleyn which followed on 1 June; for Fisher was set at liberty again within a fortnight of the latter event, no charge being made against him. In the autumn of this year (1533), various arrests were made in connexion with the so-called <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">revelations</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02319b.htm">Holy Maid of Kent</a>, but as Fisher was taken seriously ill in December, proceedings against him were postponed for a time. In March, 1534, however, a special <a href="../cathen/02059c.htm">bill of attainder</a> against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rochester and others for complicity in the matter of the <a href="../cathen/02319b.htm">Nun of Kent</a> was introduced and passed. By this Fisher was condemned to forfeiture of all his personal estate and to be <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> during the king's pleasure. Subsequently a pardon was granted him on payment of a fine of 300 pounds.

<p>In the same session of Parliament was passed the Act of Succession, by which all who should be called upon to do so were compelled to take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of succession, acknowledging the issue of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry</a> and Anne as legitimate heirs to the throne, under pain of being guilty of misprision of <a href="../cathen/15026b.htm">treason</a>. Fisher refused the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> and was sent to the Tower of London, 26 April, 1534. Several efforts were made to induce him to submit, but without effect, and in November he was a second time attained of misprision of <a href="../cathen/15026b.htm">treason</a>, his goods being forfeited as from 1 March preceding, and the <a href="../cathen/13102a.htm">See of Rochester</a> being declared <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> as from 2 June following. A long letter exists, written from the Tower by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to Thomas Cromwell, which records the severity of his confinement and the sufferings he endured.

<p>In May, 1535, the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, created Fisher <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal Priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/15486a.htm">St. Vitalis</a>, his motive being apparently to induce Henry by this mark of esteem to treat the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> less severely. The effect was precisely the reverse. Henry forbade the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat to be brought into <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, declaring that he would send the head to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> instead. In June a special commission for Fisher's trial was issued, and on 17 June he was arraigned in Westminster Hall on a charge of <a href="../cathen/15026b.htm">treason</a>, in that he denied the king to be supreme head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Since he had been deprived of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> by the Act of <a href="../cathen/02059c.htm">Attainder</a>, he was treated as a commoner, and tried by jury. He was declared guilty, and condemned to be hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn, but the mode of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">execution</a> was changed, and instead he was beheaded on Tower Hill.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> last moments were thoroughly in keeping with his previous life. He met death with a calm dignified <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> which profoundly impressed all present. His headless body was stripped and left on the scaffold till evening, when it was thrown naked into a grave in the churchyard of Allhallows, Barking. Thence it was removed a fortnight later and laid beside that of <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">Sir Thomas More</a> in the church of St. Peter ad Vincula by the Tower. His head was stuck upon a pole on London Bridge, but its ruddy and lifelike appearance excited so much attention that, after a fortnight, it was thrown into the Thames, its place being taken by that of <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">Sir Thomas More</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> occurred on 6 July next following.

<p>Several portraits of Fisher exist, the best being by <a href="../cathen/07385a.htm">Holbein</a> in the royal collection; and a few secondary <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are extant. In the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 29 December, 1886, when fifty-four of the <a href="../cathen/05474a.htm">English martyrs</a> were <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, the best place of all is given to John Fisher. <span class="stiki">He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1935 by Pope Pius XI &#151; <em>Ed.</em></span>

<p>A list of Fisher's writings will be found in Gillow, "Bibliographical Dictionary of the English Catholics" (London, s.d.), II, 262-270. There are twenty-six works in all, printed and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, mostly <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetical</a> or controversial treatises, several of which have been reprinted many times. The original editions are very rare and valuable. The principal are: <ul><li>"Treatise concernynge . . . the seven penytencyall Psalms" (London, 1508); <li>"Sermon . . . agayn ye pernicyous doctrin of Martin Luther" (London, 1521); <li>"Defensio Henrici VIII" (Cologne, 1525); <li>"De Veritate Corporis et Sanguinis Christi in Eucharistia, adversus Johannem Oecolampadium" (Cologne, 1527); <li>"De Causa Matrimonii . . .
