<h1>St. John Joseph of the Cross</h1>  

<p>Born on the Island of Ischia, Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 1654; d. 5 March, 1739. From his earliest years he was given to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. So great was his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of poverty that he would always wear the dress of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, though he was of noble birth. At the age of sixteen years he entered the Order of St. Francis at Naples, amongst the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">Friars</a> of the Alcantarine Reform, being the first Italian to join this reform which had been instituted in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> by <a href="../cathen/11770c.htm">St. Peter of Alcantara</a>. Throughout his life he was given to the greatest austerity: he <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> constantly, never drank wine, and slept but three hours each night. In 1674 he was sent to found a friary at Afila, in <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>; and he assisted with his own hands in the building. Much against his will, he was raised to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. As superior, he always insisted upon performing the lowliest offices in the community. In 1702 he was appointed Vicar Provincial of the Alcantarine Reform in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He was favoured in a high degree with the <a href="../cathen/10348a.htm">gift of miracles</a>, people of every <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> being brought to him in sickness. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> was such that even in sickness he would not spare any labour for them. His great devotion was to our <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Lady</a>, and he was urgent with his penitents that they also should cultivate this. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> in 1789, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1839.
