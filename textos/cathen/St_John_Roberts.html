<h1>St. John Roberts</h1>  

<p>First Prior of St. Gregory's, <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> (now Downside Abbey), b. 1575-6; <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> 10 December, 1610. He was the son of John and Anna Roberts of Trawsfynydd, Merionethshire, N. <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>. He matriculated at St. John's College, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, in February, 1595-6, but left after two years without taking a degree and entered as a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> student at one of the Inns of Court. In 1598 he travelled on the continent and in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, through the influence of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> fellow- countryman, was converted. By the advice of John Cecil, an <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who afterwards became a Government spy, he decided to enter the English College at <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, where he was admitted 18 October, 1598. The following year, however, he left the college for the Abbey of St. Benedict, Valladolid; whence, after some months, he was sent to make his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in the great Abbey of St. Martin at Compostella where he made his profession towards the end of 1600. His studies completed he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, and set out for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> 26 December, 1602. Although observed by a Government spy, Roberts and his companions succeeded in entering the country in April, 1603; but, his arrival being known, he was arrested and banished on 13 May following. He reached <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> on 24 May and soon managed to return to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> where he laboured <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> among the plague-stricken people in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. In 1604, while embarking for <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> with four <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a>, he was again arrested, but not being recognized as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was soon released and banished, but returned again at once. On 5 November, 1605, while Justice Grange was searching the house of Mrs. Percy, first wife of Thomas Percy, who was involved in the <a href="../cathen/07081b.htm">Gunpowder Plot</a>, he found Roberts there and arrested him. Though acquitted of any complicity in the plot itself, Roberts was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the Gatehouse at <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster</a> for seven months and then exiled anew in July, 1606.

<p>This time he was absent for some fourteen months, nearly all of which he spent at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> where he founded a house for the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who had entered various <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. This was the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Gregory at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> which still exists as Downside Abbey, near Bath, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In October, 1607, Roberts returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, was again arrested in December and placed in the Gatehouse, from which he contrived to escape after some months. He now lived for about a year in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and was again taken some time before May, 1609, in which month he was taken to Newgate and would have been executed but for the intercession of de la Broderie, the French ambassador, whose petition reduced the sentence to banishment. Roberts again visited <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, but returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> within a year, knowing that his death was certain if he were again captured. This event took place on 2 December, 1610; the pursuivants arriving just as he was concluding Mass, took him to Newgate in his vestments. On 5 December he was tried and found guilty under the Act forbidding <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to minister in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and on 10 December was hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn. The body of Roberts was recovered and taken to St. Gregory's, <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, but disappeared during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. Two fingers are still preserved at <a href="../cathen/05149a.htm">Downside</a> and Erdington Abbeys respectively and a few minor <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> exist. At Erdington also is a unique contemporary engraving of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> which has been reproduced in the "Downside Review" (XXIV, 286). The introduction of the cause of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> was approved by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in his <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 4 December, 1886.

<p>[<em>Note:</em> In 1970, John Roberts was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Pope Paul VI as one of the Forty Martyrs of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, whose joint feastday is kept on 25 October.]

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The earlier accounts given by CHALLONER, DOD (DODD), PLOWDEN, and FOLEY are misleading, as they confound John Roberts the Benedictine with an earlier priest of the same name.
