<h1>St. John Twenge</h1>  

<p>Last English saint <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>, canon regular, Prior of St. Mary's, Bridlington, b. near the town, 1319; d. at Bridlington, 1379. He was of the Yorkshire <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> Twenge, which <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> days supplied two priest-martyrs and was also instrumental in establishing the <a href="../cathen/08054a.htm">Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary</a> at Bar Convent, York. John completed his studies at Oxford and then entered the Priory of Bridlington. Charged successively with various offices in the community, he was finally despite his reluctance elected prior, which office he held until his death. Even in his lifetime he enjoyed a reputation for great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and for <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">miraculous powers</a>. On one occasion he changed water into wine. On another, five seamen from Hartlepool in danger of shipwreck called upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the name of His servant, John of Bridlington, whereupon the prior himself appeared to them in his canonical habit and brought them safely to shore. After his death the fame of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> wrought by his intercession spread rapidly through the land. Archbishop Neville charged his suffragans and others to take evidence with a view to his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>, 26 July, 1386; and the same <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> assisted by the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> and Carlisle officiated at a solemn translation of his body, 11 March, 1404, <em>de mandato Domini Papae</em>. This <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a>, shortly afterwards <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> him. The fact has been <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> and disputed; but the original <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> was recently unearthed in the Vatican archives by Mr. T.A. Twemlow, who was engaged in research work there for the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government. St. John was especially invoked by <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in cases of difficult confinement. At the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> the people besought the royal plunderer to spare the magnificent shrine of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, but in vain; it was destroyed in 1537. The splendid <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> of the church, restored in 1857, is all that now remains of Bridlington Priory. The saint's feast is observed by the canons regular on 9 October.
