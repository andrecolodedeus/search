<h1>St. John of Sahagun</h1>  

<p>Hermit, b. 1419, at Sahag&uacute;n (or San Fagondez) in the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; d. 11 June, 1479, at Salamanca; feast 12 June. In art he is represented holding a <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and host surrounded by rays of light. John, the oldest of seven children, was born of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and respected <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, John Gonzalez de Castrillo and Sancia Martinez. He received his first <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> from the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of his native place. According to the custom of the times, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> procured for him the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> of the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> Dornillos, but this caused John many qualms of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. He was later introduced to Alfonso de Cartagena, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a> (1435-1456) who took a fancy to the bright, high-spirited boy, had him <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at his own residence, gave him several <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a>, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> him <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1445, and made him canon at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Out of conscientious respect for the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, John resigned all and retained only the chaplaincy of St. Agatha, where he laboured <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p>Finding that a more thorough <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> would be beneficial, he obtained permission to enter the <a href="../cathen/13392a.htm">University of Salamanca</a>, made a four years' course, and merited his degree in divinity. During this time he exercised the sacred ministry at the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the College of St. Bartholomew (<a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St. Sebastian), and held the position for nine years. He was then <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to undergo an operation for stone, and during his illness vowed that if his life were spared, he would become a religious. On his recovery in 1463, he applied for admission to the Order of <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Hermits of St. Augustine</a>, at the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter, at Salamanca, and on 28 Aug., 1464, he made his profession.

<p>He made such progress in religious perfection that he was soon appointed master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, and in 1471 <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the community. Great was his devotion to the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, and at Mass he frequently saw the Sacred Host resplendent in glory. He was gifted with special power to penetrate the secrets of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, so that it was not easy to deceive him, and sinners were almost forced to make good confessions; he obtained wonderful results in doing away with enmities and feuds. In his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> he, like another St. John the Baptist, fearlessly preached the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and scourged the crimes and vices of the day, though thereby the rich and noble were offended. He soon made many enemies, who even hired assassins, but these, awed by the serenity and angelic sweetness of his countenance, lost <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>. Some <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of Salamanca, embittered by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> strong sermon against extravagance in dress, openly insulted him in the streets and pelted him with stones until stopped by a patrol of guards. His scathing words on impurity produced salutary effects in a certain nobleman who had been living in open <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> vengeance, and it was popularly believed that she caused the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> death by poison (this statement is found only in later biographies). Soon after death his veneration spread in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>.

<p>The process of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> began in 1525, and in 1601 he was declared Blessed. New <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were wrought at his intercession, and on 16 Oct., 1690, <a href="../cathen/01295a.htm">Alexander VIII</a> entered his name in the list of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> fixed his feast for 12 June. His relics are found in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>. His life written by John of Seville towards the end of the fifteenth century with additions in 1605 and 1619, is used by the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> in "Acta SS.", Jun., III, 112.
