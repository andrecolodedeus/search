<h1>St. John the Baptist</h1>  

<p>The principal sources of information concerning the life and ministry of St. John the Baptist are the <a href="../cathen/03274a.htm">canonical</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>. Of these <a href="../bible/luk000.htm">St. Luke</a> is the most complete, giving as he does the wonderful circumstances accompanying the birth of the Precursor and items on his ministry and death. <a href="../bible/mat000.htm">St. Matthew's Gospel</a> stands in close relation with that of <a href="../bible/luk000.htm">St. Luke</a>, as far as John's public ministry is concerned, but contains nothing in reference to his early life. From <a href="../bible/mar000.htm">St. Mark</a>, whose account of the Precursor's life is very meagre, no new detail can be gathered. Finally, the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">fourth Gospel</a> has this special feature, that it gives the testimony of St. John after the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Besides the indications supplied by these writings, passing allusions occur in such passages as <a href="../bible/act013.htm#vrs24">Acts 13:24</a>; <a href="../bible/act019.htm#vrs1">19:1-6</a>; but these are few and bear on the subject only indirectly. To the above should be added that <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> relates in his Jewish Antiquities (XVIII, v, 2), but it should be remembered that he is woefully erratic in his dates, mistaken in proper names, and seems to arrange facts according to his own political views; however, his judgment of John, also what he tells us regarding the Precursor's popularity, together with a few details of minor importance, are worthy of the historian's attention. The same cannot be said of the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> gospels, because the scant information they give of the Precursor is either copied from the <a href="../cathen/03274a.htm">canonical</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> (and to these they can add no authority), or else is a mass of idle vagaries.

<p>Zachary, the father of John the Baptist, was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the course of Abia, the eighth of the twenty-four courses into which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were divided (<a href="../bible/1ch024.htm#vrs7">1 Chronicles 24:7-19</a>); Elizabeth, the Precursor's mother, "was of the daughters of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>", according to <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs5">St. Luke (1:5)</a>; the same Evangelist, a few verses farther on (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs6">1:36</a>), calls her the "cousin" (<em>syggenis</em>) of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>. These two statements appear to be conflicting, for how, it will be asked, could a cousin of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> be "of the daughters of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>"? The problem might be solved by adopting the reading given in an old <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a> version, where we find "mother's sister" (<em>metradelphe</em>) instead of "cousin".

<p>A somewhat analogous explanation, probably borrowed from some <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> writing, and perhaps correct, is given by <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">St. Hippolytus</a> (in Nicephor., II, iii). According to him, Mathan had three daughters: Mary, Soba, and <a href="../cathen/01538a.htm">Ann</a>. Mary, the oldest, married a man of Bethlehem and was the mother of Salome; Soba married at Bethlehem also, but a <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">"son of Levi"</a>, by whom she had Elizabeth; <a href="../cathen/01538a.htm">Ann</a> wedded a Galilean (Joachim) and bore <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary, the Mother of God</a>. Thus Salome, Elizabeth, and the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> were first cousins, and Elizabeth, "of the daughters of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>" on her father's side, was, on her mother's side, the cousin of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>. Zachary's home is designated only in a vague manner by <a href="../bible/luk000.htm">St. Luke</a>: it was "a city of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>", "in the hill-country" (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs39">1:39</a>). Reland, advocating the unwarranted assumption that <em>Juda</em> might be a misspelling of the name, proposed to read in its stead <em>Jutta</em> (<a href="../bible/jos015.htm#vrs55">Joshua 15:55</a>; <a href="../bible/jos021.htm#vrs16">21:16</a>; <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">D.V.</a>; Jota, Jeta), a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> town south of <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> did not always live in <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> towns (Mathathias's home was at Modin; <a href="../cathen/09493b.htm">Simon Machabeus's</a> at <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a>). A tradition, which can be traced back to the time before the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>, points to the little town of Ain-Karim, five miles south-west of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.

<p>The birth of the Precursor was announced in a most striking manner. Zachary and Elizabeth, as we learn from <a href="../bible/luk000.htm">St. Luke</a>, "were both just before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, walking in all the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a> and justifications of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> without blame; and they had no son, for that Elizabeth was barren" (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs6">1:6-7</a>). Long they had <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that their union might be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> with offspring; but, now that "they were both advanced in years", the reproach of barrenness bore heavily upon them. "And it came to pass, when he executed the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> function in the order of his course before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to the custom of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office, it was his lot to offer <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, going into the temple of the Lord. And all the multitude of the people was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> without, at the hour of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>. And there appeared to him an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a>, standing on the right side of the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a> of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>. And Zachary seeing him, was troubled, and fear fell upon him. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to him: Fear not, Zachary, for thy <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is heard; and they wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John: and thou shalt have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice in his nativity. For he shall be great before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>; and shall drink no wine nor strong drink: and he shall be filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, even from his mother's womb. And he shall <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">convert</a> many of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord their God</a>. And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>; that he may turn the hearts of the fathers unto the children, and the incredulous to the wisdom of the just, to prepare unto the Lord a <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a> people" (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs8">1:8-17</a>). As Zachary was slow in <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> this startling prediction, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, making himself known to him, announced that, in punishment of his incredulity, he should be stricken with dumbness until the promise was fulfilled. "And it came to pass, after the days of his office were accomplished, he departed to his own house. And after those days, Elizabeth his wife conceived, and hid herself five months" (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs23">1:23-24</a>).

<p>Now during the sixth month, the <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation</a> had taken place, and, as <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> had heard from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> the fact of her cousin's conceiving, she went "with haste" to congratulate her. "And it came to pass, that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">infant</a>" &#151; filled, like the mother, with the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Holy Ghost</a> &#151; "leaped for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in her womb", as if to acknowledge the presence of his <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>. Then was accomplished the prophetic utterance of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> that the child should "be filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> even from his mother's womb". Now as the presence of any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whatever is incompatible with the indwelling of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it follows that at this moment John was cleansed from the stain of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. When "<a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elizabeth's</a> full time of being delivered was come. . .she brought forth a son" (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs57">1:57</a>); and "on the eighth day they came to <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcise</a> the child, and they called him by his father's name Zachary. And his mother answering, said: Not so, but he shall be called John. And they said to her: There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name. And they made sign to his father, how he would have him called. And demanding a writing table, he wrote, saying: John is his name. And they all wondered" (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs59">1:59-63</a>). They were not aware that no better name could be applied (John, Hebrew; <em>Jehohanan</em>, i.e. "Jahweh hath mercy") to him who, as his father <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesied</a>, was to "go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways; to give <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to his people, unto remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: through the bowels of the mercy of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs76">1:76-78</a>). Moreover, all these events, to wit, a child born to an aged couple, Zachary's sudden dumbness, his equally sudden recovery of speech, his astounding utterance, might justly strike with wonderment the assembled neighbours; these could hardly help asking: "What an one, think ye, shall this child be?" (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs66">1:66</a>).

<p>As to the date of the birth of John the Baptist, nothing can be said with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>. The Gospel suggests that the Precursor was born about six months before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; but the year of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> nativity has not so far been ascertained. Nor is there anything certain about the season of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth, for it is well known that the assignment of the <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">feast of Christmas</a> to the twenty-fifth of December is not grounded on historical evidence, but is possibly suggested by merely <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> considerations, also, perhaps, inferred from astronomico-theological reasonings. Besides, no calculations can be based upon the time of the year when the course of Abia was serving in the Temple, since each one of the twenty-four courses of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had two turns a year. Of John's early life <a href="../bible/luk000.htm">St. Luke</a> tell us only that "the child grew, and was strengthened in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>; and was in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">deserts</a>, until the day of his manifestation to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>" (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs80">1:80</a>). Should we ask just when the Precursor went into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, an old tradition echoed by <a href="../cathen/11591b.htm">Paul Warnefried (Paul the Deacon)</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>, <a href="../cathen/15244a.htm">"Ut queant laxis"</a>, composed in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, gives an answer hardly more definite than the statement of the Gospel: "Antra deserti teneris sub annis. . .petiit . . ." Other writers, however, thought they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> better. For instance, <a href="../cathen/11771a.htm">St. Peter of Alexandria</a> believed St. John was taken into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> to escape the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, who, if we may believe report, was impelled by fear of losing his kingdom to seek the life of the Precursor, just as he was, later on, to seek that of the new-born <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>. It was added also that <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> on this account had Zachary put to death between the temple and the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>, because he had <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesied</a> the coming of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> (Baron., "Annal. Apparat.", n. 53). These are worthless legends long since branded by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> as "apocryphorum somnia".


<p>Passing, then, with <a href="../bible/luk000.htm">St. Luke</a>, over a period of some thirty years, we reach what may be considered the beginning of the public ministry of St. John (see <a href="../cathen/03731a.htm">BIBLICAL CHRONOLOGY</a>). Up to this he had led in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> the life of an <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorite</a>; now he comes forth to deliver his message to the world. "In the fifteenth year of the reign of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius Caesar</a>. . .the word of the Lord was made unto John, the son of Zachary, in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. And he came into all the country about the Jordan, preaching" (<a href="../bible/luk003.htm#vrs1">Luke 3:1-3</a>), clothed not in the soft garments of a courtier (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs8">Matthew 11:8</a>; <a href="../bible/luk007.htm#vrs24">Luke 7:24</a>), but in those "of camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his loins"; and "his meat" &#151; he looked as if he came neither eating nor drinking (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs18">Matthew 11:18</a>; <a href="../bible/luk007.htm#vrs33">Luke 7:33</a>) &#151; "was locusts and wild honey" (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#vrs4">Matthew 3:4</a>; <a href="../bible/mar001.htm#vrs6">Mark 1:6</a>); his whole countenance, far from suggesting the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a reed shaken by the wind (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs7">Matthew 11:7</a>; <a href="../bible/luk007.htm#vrs24">Luke 7:24</a>), manifested undaunted constancy. A few incredulous scoffers feigned to be <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>: "He <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">hath a devil</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs18">Matthew 11:18</a>). Nevertheless, "Jerusalem and all <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and all the country about Jordan" (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#vrs5">Matthew 3:5</a>), drawn by his strong and winning personality, went out to him; the austerity of his life added immensely to the weight of his words; for the simple folk, he was truly a prophet (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs9">Matthew 11:9</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs76">Luke 1:76, 77</a>). "Do penance: for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is at hand" (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#vrs2">Matthew 3:2</a>), such was the burden of his teaching. <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Men</a> of all conditions flocked round him.

<p><a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> were there; the latter attracted perhaps by curiosity and scepticism, the former expecting possibly a word of praise for their multitudinous customs and practices, and all, probably, more anxious to see which of the rival <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> the new prophet would commend than to seek instruction. But John laid bare their <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrisy</a>. Drawing his similes from the surrounding scenery, and even, after the Oriental fashion, making use of a play on words (<em>abanimbanium</em>), he lashed their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> with this well-deserved rebuke: "Ye brood of vipers, who hath shewed you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of penance. And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father. For I tell you that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham. For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doth not yield good fruit, shall be cut down, and cast into the fire" (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#vrs7">Matthew 3:7-10</a>; <a href="../bible/luk003.htm#vrs7">Luke 3:7-9</a>). It was clear something had to be done. The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of good will among the listeners asked: "What shall we do?" (Probably some were <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> and, according to the custom of people in such circumstances, were clad in two tunics. - Josephus, "Antiq.", XVIII, v, 7). "And he answering, said to them: He that hath two coats, let him give to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do in like manner" (<a href="../bible/luk003.htm#vrs11">Luke 3:11</a>). Some were <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a>; on them he enjoined not to exact more than the rate of taxes fixed by law (<a href="../bible/luk003.htm#vrs13">Luke 3:13</a>). To the soldiers (probably <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> police officers) he recommended not to do <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to any man, nor falsely to denounce anyone, and to be content with their pay (<a href="../bible/luk003.htm#vrs14">Luke 3:14</a>). In other words, he cautioned them against trusting in their national privileges, he did not countenance the tenets of any <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, nor did he advocate the forsaking of one's ordinary state of life, but faithfulness and honesty in the fulfillment of one's <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> confession of one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p>To confirm the good dispositions of his listeners, John <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> them in the Jordan, "saying that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was good, not so much to free one from certain <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> [cf. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, <a href="../summa/4038.htm#article2">Summa III.38.2 and 3</a>] as to purify the body, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being already cleansed from its defilements by <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>" (Josephus, "Antiq.", XVIII, vii). This feature of his ministry, more than anything else, attracted public attention to such an extent that he was surnamed "the Baptist" (i.e. Baptizer) even during his lifetime (by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs11">Matthew 11:11</a>; by his own disciples, <a href="../bible/luk007.htm#vrs20">Luke 7:20</a>; by <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, <a href="../bible/mat014.htm#vrs2">Matthew 14:2</a>; by <a href="../cathen/07292a.htm">Herodias</a>, <a href="../bible/mat014.htm#vrs3">Matthew 14:3</a>). Still his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> was questioned by some (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs25">John 1:25</a>); the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">lawyers</a> refused to comply with this <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, on the plea that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, as a preparation for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, was connected only with the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> (<a href="../bible/eze036.htm#vrs25">Ezekiel 36:25</a>; <a href="../bible/zec013.htm#vrs1">Zechariah 13:1</a>, etc.), <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>, and the prophet spoken of in <a href="../bible/deu018.htm#vrs15">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>. John's reply was that he was Divinely "sent to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> with water" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs33">John 1:33</a>); to this, later on, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> bore testimony, when, in answer to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> trying to ensnare him, he implicitly declared that John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> (<a href="../bible/mar011.htm#vrs30">Mark 11:30</a>). Whilst <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, John, lest the people might think "that perhaps he might be the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>" (<a href="../bible/luk003.htm#vrs15">Luke 3:15</a>), did not fail to insist that his was only a forerunner's mission: "I indeed <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you with water; but there shall come one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to loose: he shall <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and with fire: whose fan is in his hand and he will purge his floor; and will gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire" (<a href="../bible/luk003.htm#vrs16">Luke 3:16, 17</a>). Whatever John may have meant by this <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> "with fire", he, at all events, in this declaration clearly defined his relation to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">One</a> to come.

<p>Here it will not be amiss to touch on the scene of the Precursor's ministry. The locality should be sought in that part of the Jordan valley (<a href="../bible/luk003.htm#vrs3">Luke 3:3</a>) which is called the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> (<a href="../bible/mar001.htm#vrs4">Mark 1:4</a>). Two places are mentioned in the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a> in this connection: <a href="../cathen/02532a.htm">Bethania</a> (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs28">John 1:28</a>) and <a href="../cathen/01173b.htm">Ennon</a> (A.V. &AElig;non, <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs23">John 3:23</a>). As to <a href="../cathen/02532a.htm">Bethania</a>, the reading Bethabara, first given by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, should be discarded; but the Alexandrine scholar perhaps was less wrong in suggesting the other reading, <em>Bethara</em>, possibly a Greek form of <em>Betharan</em>; at any rate, the site in question must be looked for "beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs28">John 1:28</a>). The second place, <a href="../cathen/01173b.htm">Ennon</a>, "near Salim" (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs23">John 3:23</a>), the extreme northern point marked in the Madaba <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> map, is described in <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius's</a> "Onomasticon" as being eight miles south of <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Scythopolis (Beisan)</a>, and should be sought probably at Ed-Deir or El-Ftur, a short distance from the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> (Lagrange, in "Revue Biblique", IV, 1895, pp. 502-05). Moreover, a long-standing tradition, traced back to A.D. 333, associates the activity of the Precursor, particularly the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, with the neighbourhood of Deir Mar-Yuhanna (Qasr el-Yehud).

<p>The Precursor had been preaching and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> for some time (just how long is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>), when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> came from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by him. Why, it might be asked, should He "who did no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" (<a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#vrs22">1 Peter 2:22</a>) seek John's "baptism of penance for the remission of sins" (<a href="../bible/luk003.htm#vrs3">Luke 3:3</a>)? The <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> answer very appropriately that this was the occasion preordained by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> should be manifested to the world as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; then again, by submitting to it, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> sanctioned the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John. "But John stayed him, saying: I ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by thee, and comest thou to me?" (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#vrs14">Matthew 3:14</a>). These words, implying, as they do, that John <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, are in seeming conflict with a later declaration of John recorded in the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a>: "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him not" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs33">John 1:33</a>). Most interpreters take it that the Precursor had some intimation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> being the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>: they assign this as the reason why John at first refused to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> him; but the heavenly manifestation had, a few moments later, changed this intimation into perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. "And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, said to him: Suffer it to be so now. For so it becometh us to fulfil all <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Then he suffered him. And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, forthwith came out of the water: and lo, the heavens were opened to him. . .And, behold, a voice from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased" (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#vrs15">Matthew 3:15-17</a>).

<p>After this <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, while <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was preaching through the towns of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, going into <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> only occasionally for the feast days, John continued his ministry in the valley of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>. It was at this time that "the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> sent from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> to him, to ask him: Who are thou? And he confessed, and did not deny: and he confessed: I am not the Christ. And they asked him: What then? Art thou <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>? And he said: I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered: No. They said, therefore, unto him: Who are thou, that we may give an answer to them that sent us? What sayest thou of thyself? He said: I am the voice of one crying in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, make straight the way of the Lord, as said the <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">prophet Isaias</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs19">John 1:19-23</a>). John denied he was Elias, whom the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were looking for (<a href="../bible/mat017.htm#vrs10">Matthew 17:10</a>; <a href="../bible/mar009.htm#vrs10">Mark 9:10</a>). Nor did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> admit it, though His words to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> at first sight seem to point that way; "Elias indeed shall come, and restore all things. But I say to you, that Elias is already come" (<a href="../bible/mat017.htm#vrs11">Matthew 17:11</a>; <a href="../bible/mar009.htm#vrs11">Mark 9:11-12</a>). St. Matthew notes "the disciples understood, that he had spoken to them of John the Baptist" (<a href="../bible/mat017.htm#vrs13">Matthew 17:13</a>). This was equal to saying, "Elias is not to come in the flesh." But, in speaking of John before the multitude, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> made it plain that he called John Elias figuratively: "If you will receive it, he is Elias that is to come. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear" (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs14">Matthew 11:14, 15</a>). This had been anticipated by the <a href="../cathen/06330a.htm">angel</a> when, announcing John's birth to Zachary, he foretold that the child would go before the Lord "in the spirit and power of Elias" (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs17">Luke 1:17</a>). "The next day, John saw <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> coming to him and he saith: Behold the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">Lamb of God</a>, behold him who taketh away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world. This is he of whom I said: After me there cometh a man, who is preferred before me: because he was before me. . .that he may be made manifest in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, therefore am I come <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> with water . . . . And I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him not; but he who sent me to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> with water, said to me: He upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining upon him, he it is that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizeth</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And I saw, and I gave testimony, that this is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs20">John 1:20-34</a>).

<p>Among the many listeners flocking to St. John, some, more deeply touched by his doctrine, stayed with him, thus forming, as around other famous doctors of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, a group of disciples. These he exhorted to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a> (<a href="../bible/mar002.htm#vrs18">Mark 2:18</a>), these he taught special forms of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> (<a href="../bible/luk005.htm#vrs33">Luke 5:33</a>; <a href="../bible/luk011.htm#vrs1">11:1</a>). Their number, according to the <a href="../cathen/04039b.htm">pseudo-Clementine literature</a>, reached thirty (<a href="../fathers/080802.htm">Homily 2.23</a>). Among them was <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Andrew of Bethsaida</a> of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs44">John 1:44</a>). One day, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was standing in the distance, John, pointed Him out, repeated his previous declaration: "Behold the Lamb of God". Then <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Andrew</a>, with another disciple of John, hearing this, followed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs36">John 1:36-38</a>). The account of the calling of <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Andrew</a> and <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon</a> differs materially from that found in <a href="../bible/mat000.htm">St. Matthew</a>, <a href="../bible/mar000.htm">St. Mark</a>, and <a href="../bible/luk000.htm">St. Luke</a>; yet it should be noticed that <a href="../bible/luk000.htm">St. Luke</a>, in particular, so narrates the meeting of the two brothers with the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, as to let us infer they already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him. Now, on the other hand, since the Fourth Evangelist does not say that <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Andrew</a> and his companions forthwith left their business to devote themselves exclusively to the Gospel or its preparation, there is clearly no absolute discordance between the narration of the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">first three Gospels</a> and that of <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">St. John</a>.

<p>The Precursor, after the lapse of several months, again appears on the scene, and he is still preaching and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> on the banks of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs23">John 3:23</a>). <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, in the meantime, had gathered about Himself a following of <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and He came "into the land of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>: and there He abode with them, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs22">John 3:22</a>), &#151; "though <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> himself did not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, but his disciples" (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm#vrs2">John 4:2</a>). &#151; "There arose a question between some of John's disciples and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> [the best Greek texts have "a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>"] concerning purification" (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs25">John 3:25</a>), that is to say, as is suggested by the context, concerning the relative value of both <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a>. The disciples of John came to him: "<a href="../cathen/12617b.htm">Rabbi</a>, he that was with thee beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, to whom thou gavest testimony, behold he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizeth</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> come to him" (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs26">John 3:26-27</a>). They undoubtedly meant that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> should give way to John who had recommended Him, and that, by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, He was encroaching upon the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of John. "John answered and said: A man cannot receive anything, unless it be given him from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. You yourselves do bear me witness, that I said, I am not <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, but that I am sent before him. He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> because of the bridegroom's voice. This my joy, therefore, is fulfilled. He must increase, but I must decrease. He that cometh from above, is above all. He that is of the earth, of the earth he is, and of the earth he speaketh. He that cometh from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, is above all. And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth. . ." (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs27">John 3:27-36</a>).

<p>The above narration recalls the fact before mentioned (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs28">John 1:28</a>), that part of the Baptist's ministry was exercised in Perea: <a href="../cathen/01173b.htm">Ennon</a>, another scene of his labours, was within the borders of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>; both Perea and <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> made up the tetrarchy of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#IV">Herod Antipas</a>. This prince, a son worthy of his father <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod the Great</a>, had married, likely for political reasons, the daughter of Aretas, king of the Nabathaeans. But on a visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he fell in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with his niece <a href="../cathen/07292a.htm">Herodias</a>, the wife of his half-brother Philip (son of the younger Mariamne), and induced her to come on to <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>. When and where the Precursor met <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, we are not told, but from the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">synoptic Gospels</a> we learn that John dared to rebuke the tetrarch for his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> deeds, especially his public <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, swayed by <a href="../cathen/07292a.htm">Herodias</a>, did not allow the unwelcome reprover to go unpunished: he "sent and apprehended John and bound him in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>". <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> tell us quite another story, containing perhaps also an element of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. "As great crowds clustered around John, <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> became afraid lest the Baptist should abuse his moral authority over them to incite them to rebellion, as they would do anything at his bidding; therefore he thought it wiser, so as to prevent possible happenings, to take away the dangerous preacher. . .and he <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> him in the fortress of Machaerus" (Antiq., XVIII, v, 2). Whatever may have been the chief motive of the tetrarch's policy, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that <a href="../cathen/07292a.htm">Herodias</a> nourished a bitter <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against John: "She laid snares for him: and was desirous to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put him to death</a>" (<a href="../bible/mar006.htm#vrs19">Mark 6:19</a>). Although <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> first shared her desire, yet "he feared the people: because they esteemed him as a prophet" (<a href="../bible/mat014.htm#vrs5">Matthew 14:5</a>). After some time this resentment on <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> part seems to have abated, for, according to <a href="../bible/mar006.htm#vrs19">Mark 6:19-20</a>, he heard John willingly and did many things at his suggestion.

<p>John, in his fetters, was attended by some of his disciples, who kept him in touch with the events of the day. He thus learned of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonders</a> wrought by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. At this point it cannot be supposed that John's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> wavered in the least. Some of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, however, would not be convinced by his words that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>. Accordingly, he sent them to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, bidding them say: "John the Baptist hath sent us to thee, saying: Art thou he that art to come; or look we for another? (And in that same hour, he cured many of their [the people's] diseases, and hurts, and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>; and to many that were blind he gave sight.) And answering, he said to them: Go and relate to John what you have heard and seen: the blind see, the lame walk, the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> are made clean, the deaf hear, the dead rise again, to the poor the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> is preached: and blessed is he whosoever shall not be <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a> in me" (<a href="../bible/luk007.htm#vrs20">Luke 7:20-23</a>; <a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs3">Matthew 11:3-6</a>).

<p>How this interview affected John's disciples, we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; but we do <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the encomium it occasioned of John from the lips of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>: "And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak to the multitudes concerning John. What went ye out into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> to see? A reed shaken with the wind?" All <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> full well why John was in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and that in his captivity he was more than ever the undaunted champion of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. &mdash; "But what went you out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Behold they that are in costly apparel, and live delicately, are in the houses of kings. But what went you out to see? A <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>? Yea, I say to you, and more than a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. This is he of whom it is written: Behold, I send my <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee. For I say to you: Amongst those that are born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, there is not a greater <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> than John the Baptist" (<a href="../bible/luk007.htm#vrs24">Luke 7:24-28</a>). And continuing, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> pointed out the inconsistency of the world in its opinions both of himself and his precursor: "John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and you say: He <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">hath a devil</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> is coming eating and drinking: and you say: Behold a man that is a <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">glutton</a> and a drinker of wine, a friend of <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> and sinners. And wisdom is justified by all her children" (<a href="../bible/luk007.htm#vrs33">Luke 7:33-35</a>).

<p>St. John languished probably for some time in the fortress of Machaerus; but the ire of <a href="../cathen/07292a.htm">Herodias</a>, unlike that of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, never abated: she watched her chance. It came at the birthday feast which <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, after Roman fashion, gave to the "princes, and tribunes, and chief men of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>. And when the daughter of the same <a href="../cathen/07292a.htm">Herodias</a> [<a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> gives her name: Salome] had come in, and had <a href="../cathen/04618b.htm">danced</a>, and pleased <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> and them that were at table with him, the king said to the damsel: Ask of me what thou wilt, and I will give it thee. . .Who when she was gone out, said to her mother, what shall I ask? But she said: The head of John the Baptist. And when she was come in immediately with haste to the king, she asked, saying: I will that forthwith thou give me in a dish, the head of John the Baptist. And the king was struck sad. Yet because of his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, and because of them that were with him at table, he would not displease her: but sending an executioner, he commanded that his head should be brought in a dish: and gave it to the damsel, and the damsel gave it to her mother" (<a href="../bible/mar006.htm#vrs21">Mark 6:21-28</a>). Thus was done to death the greatest "amongst them that are born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>", the prize awarded to a dancing girl, the toll exacted for an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> rashly taken and criminally kept (St. Augustine). At such an unjustifiable execution even the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were shocked, and they attributed to Divine vengeance the defeat <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> sustained afterwards at the hands of Aretas, his rightful father-in-law (Josephus, loc. cit.). John's disciples, hearing of his death, "came, and took his body, and laid it in a tomb" (<a href="../bible/mar006.htm#vrs29">Mark 6:29</a>), "and came and told <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat014.htm#vrs12">Matthew 14:12</a>).

<p>The lasting impression made by the Precursor upon those who had come within his influence cannot be better illustrated than by mentioned the awe which seize upon <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> when he heard of the wonders wrought by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> who, in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, was not other than John the Baptist come to <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> (<a href="../bible/mat014.htm#vrs1">Matthew 14:1, 2</a>, etc.). The Precursor's influence did not die with him. It was far-reaching, too, as we learn from <a href="../bible/act018.htm#vrs25">Acts 18:25</a>; <a href="../bible/act019.htm#vrs3">19:3</a>, where we find that <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselytes</a> at Ephesus had received from Apollo and others the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">early Christian writers</a> speak of a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> taking its name from John and holding only to his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.

<p>The date of John the Baptist's death, 29 August, assigned in the liturgical calendars can hardly be relied upon, because it is scarcely based upon trustworthy documents. His burial-place has been fixed by an old tradition at Sebaste (<a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>). But if there be any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus's</a> assertion, that John was put to death at Machaerus, it is hard to understand why he was buried so far from the Herodian fortress. Still, it is quite possible that, at a later date unknown to us, his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">sacred remains</a> were carried to Sebaste. At any rate, about the middle of the fourth century, his tomb was there <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a>, as we are informed on the testimony of Rufinus and Theodoretus. These authors add that the shrine was <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecrated</a> under <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a> (c. A.D. 362), the bones being partly burned. A portion of the rescued <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were carried to Jerusalem, then to Alexandria; and there, on 27 May, 395, these <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were laid in the gorgeous basilica just <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to the Precursor on the site of the once famous temple of Serapis. The tomb at <a href="../cathen/13667a.htm">Sebaste</a> continued, nevertheless, to be visited by pious <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> bears witness to the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> there wrought. Perhaps some of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> had been brought back to <a href="../cathen/13667a.htm">Sebaste</a>. Other portions at different times found their way to many sanctuaries of the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a>, and long is the list of the churches claiming possession of some part of the precious treasure. What became of the head of the Precursor is difficult to determine. <a href="../cathen/11050a.htm">Nicephorus</a> (I, ix) and <a href="../cathen/10225a.htm">Metaphrastes</a> say <a href="../cathen/07292a.htm">Herodias</a> had it buried in the fortress of Machaerus; others insist that it was interred in <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> palace at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; there it was found during the reign of Constantine, and thence secretly taken to <a href="../cathen/05402a.htm">Emesa</a>, in <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a>, where it was concealed, the place remaining unknown for years, until it was manifested by <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">revelation</a> in 453. In the many and discordant relations concerning this <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a>, unfortunately much uncertainty prevails; their discrepancies in almost every point render the problem so intricate as to baffle solution. This signal <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a>, in whole or in part, is claimed by several churches, among them <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, Nemours, St-Jean d'Angeli (France), S. Silvestro in Capite (<a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>). This fact <a href="../cathen/14724b.htm">Tillemont</a> traces to a mistaking of one St. John for another, an explanation which, in certain cases, appears to be founded on good grounds and accounts well for this otherwise puzzling multiplication of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> paid so early and in so many places to the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. John the Baptist, the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> with which many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> have maintained at all times their ill-founded claims to some of his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, the numberless churches, <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, towns, and religious <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> placed under his <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">patronage</a>, the frequency of his name among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people, all attest the antiquity and widespread diffusion of the devotion to the Precursor. The commemoration of his Nativity is one of the oldest <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feasts</a>, if not the oldest feast, introduced into both the Greek and Latin <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. But why is the feast proper, as it were, of St. John on the day of his nativity, whereas with other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> it is the day of their death? Because it was meant that the birth of him who, unlike the rest, was "filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> even from his mother's womb", should be signalized as a day of triumph. The celebration of the Decollation of John the Baptist, on 29 August, enjoys almost the same antiquity. We find also in the oldest <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> mention of a feast of the Conception of the Precursor on 24 September. But the most <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> celebration in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of this <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was always that of his Nativity, preceded until recently by a <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a>. Many places adopted the custom introduced by St. Sabas of having a double Office on this day, as on the day of the Nativity of the Lord. The first Office, intended to signify the time of the Law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">Prophets</a> which lasted up to St. John (<a href="../bible/luk016.htm#vrs16">Luke 16:16</a>), began at sunset, and was chanted without <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>; the second, meant to celebrate the opening of the time of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and gladdened by the singing of <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>, was held during the night. The resemblance of the feast of St. John with that of <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> was carried farther, for another feature of the 24th of June was the celebration of three masses: the first, in the dead of night, recalled his mission of Precursor; the second, at daybreak, commemorated the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> he conferred; and the third, at the hour of <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">Terce</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. The whole liturgy of the day, repeatedly enriched by the additions of several <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, was in suggestiveness and beauty on a part with the liturgy of <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>. So sacred was St. John's day deemed that two rival armies, meeting face to face on 23 June, by common accord put off the battle until the morrow of the feast (Battle of Fontenay, 841). "Joy, which is the characteristic of the day, radiated from the sacred precincts. The lovely summer nights, at St. John's tide, gave free scope to popular display of lively <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> among various nationalities. Scarce had the last rays of the setting sun died away when, all the world over, immense columns of flame arose from every mountain-top, and in an instant, every town, and village, and hamlet was lighted up" (<a href="../cathen/07058a.htm">Gu&eacute;ranger</a>). The custom of the "St. John's fires", whatever its origin, has, in certain regions, endured unto this day.
