<h1>St. John the Silent</h1>  

<p>(Hesychastes, Silentiarius).

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04125b.htm">Colonia</a>, in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, b. at Nicopolis, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, 8 Jan., 452; d. 558. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, Encratius and Euphemia, wealthy and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a>, belonged to <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> that had done great service in the State and had given to it renowned generals and governors, but they were also good <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and gave their son a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. After their death in 471, John distributed his inheritance among his relatives, retaining only a small share, with which he built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> and a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Here, with ten congenial companions, he began a life of <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> and self-denial, wonderful traits of which are recorded by his biographer. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13667a.htm">Sebaste</a> drew him out of his solitude and made him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04125b.htm">Colonia</a> (Taxara) in 481, against which promotion John vainly struggled. In his new dignity he preserved the monastic spirit entire, and the austerities and exercises as far as was compatible with <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. His brother-in-law Pasinius oppressed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to such an extent that John had to call upon the Emperor Zeno for assistance. As soon as matters had been properly arranged, John left his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, went to the Laura, near <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and placed himself under the obedience of St. Sabas, without revealing his identity. In course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> Sabas, who had subjected John to all kinds of trials and had found him ready to perform even the most common and menial labours, thought him worthy of receiving <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and for this purpose sent him to Elias, the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. John now revealed all, and Elias informed Sabas that John had confided to him things which forbade his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>. Sabas at first felt very sad, but was comforted by a vision in which the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> state of affairs was made known to him. John with the permission of his superior entered a hut built against the face of a rock in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and here passed the remainder of his days in seclusion and perpetual silence, whence his surname. A contemporary, Cyril of <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Scythopolis</a>, wrote his life. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is on 13 May.
