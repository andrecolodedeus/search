<h1>St. John's University</h1>  

<p>The legal title of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> boarding-school at Collegeville, <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>, conducted by the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Fathers</a> of St. John's Abbey, which is situated at the same place. It is the oldest <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> college in the North-West, having been founded in 1857 by the late <a href="../cathen/15648b.htm">Archabbot Boniface Wimmer</a>, then <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Vincent's Abbey at Beatty, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. Early in 1856 <a href="../cathen/15648b.htm">Abbot Wimmer</a> sent Demetrius de Marogna, a capitular of St. Vincent's Abbey, to Minnesota to establish a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and an <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institution</a> in what was then the Diocese of St. Paul, whither the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> had been invited by Bishop Cretin, at the instance of the Indian missionary Father Piera. De Marogna was accompanied by two <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, Cornelius Wittmann and Bruno Riss, and two <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>. The institution was originally called St. John's Seminary, which name was changed to St. John's University by an Act of the State Legislature, 17 Feb., 1863. In March, 1869, the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was empowered by the State to confer all college and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> degrees, and on 16 June, 1878, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> authorized Abbot Alexius Edelbrock, then president of the University, to confer the degree of doctor in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and canon law. The institution comprises a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of arts and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, a high-school, a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of commerce and a preparatory <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>.

<p>Among its presidents deserving of mention are: Rupert Seidenbusch (1867-1875), who in 1875 was appointed <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of the newly-created Vicariate of Northern Minnesota, and <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Halia (d. 3 June, 1895); Alexius Edelbrock (1875-89), who erected the main <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> building and the beautiful church (d. 18 May, 1908, as <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Anselm's Church, New York City), Bernard Locnikar (1890-94), who made the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course a model of its kind (d. 7 Nov., 1894). Since 1894, under the presidency of Peter Engel, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> has grown rapidly. The buildings include the main <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> building, the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> hall, the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, the observatory, the gymnasium, and the infirmary. The faculty is composed of 42 professors and instructors, all of whom, except the physical instructor, are Beneictines and members of St. John's Abbey. The number of students during the year 1911-12 in all departments was 441.
