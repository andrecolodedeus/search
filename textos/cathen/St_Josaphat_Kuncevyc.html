<h1>St. Josaphat Kuncevyc</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a>, born in the little town of Volodymyr in <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a> (Volyn) in 1580 or &#151; according to some writers &#151; 1584; died at Vitebsk, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, 12 November, 1623.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> birth occurred in a gloomy period for the <a href="../cathen/13277a.htm">Ruthenian Church</a>. Even as early as the beginning of the sixteenth century the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Florentine</a> Union had become a dead-letter; in the case of the <a href="../cathen/13277a.htm">Ruthenian Church</a>, complete demoralization followed in the wake of its <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">severance</a> from <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Rome</a>, and the whole body of its <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> became notorious alike for their gross <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">viciousness</a> of their lives. After the <a href="../cathen/15130a.htm">Union of Berest&rsquo;</a> in 1596 the <a href="../cathen/13277a.htm">Ruthenian Church</a> was divided into two contending parties &#151; the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Uniates</a> and those who persevered in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> &#151; each with its own <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. Among the leaders of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> party, who laboured to enkindle popular <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Uniates</a>, Meletius Smotryckyj was conspicuous, and the most celebrated of his victims was Josaphat.

<p>Although of a noble <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> stock, Josaphat's father had devoted himself to commercial pursuits, and held the office of town-councilor. Both <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> contributed to implant the seeds of piety in the heart of their child. In the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Volodymyr Josaphat &#151; Johannes was the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">baptismal name</a> &#151; gave evidence of unusual talent; he applied himself with the greatest <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> to the study of <a href="../cathen/14041b.htm">ecclesiastical Slav</a>, and learned almost the entire <em>casoslov</em> (<a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">breviary</a>), which from this period he began to read daily. From this source he drew his early <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">religious education</a>, for the unlettered <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> seldom preached or gave <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical instruction</a>. Owing to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">straitened</a> circumstances of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, he was apprenticed to the merchant Popovyc at <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>. In this town, remarkable for the corruption of its <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> and the contentions of the various <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">religious sects</a>, he seemed specially guarded by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Providence</a>, and became acquainted with certain excellent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> (e.g. Benjamin Rutski), under whose direction he advanced in learning and in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>At the age of twenty-four (1604) he entered the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">monastery</a> of the Trinity at <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>. The fame of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> rapidly spread, and distinguished <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">people</a> began to visit him. After a notable life as a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, Rutski also joined the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">order</a>, bringing with him a wide erudition. When Josaphat reached the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a>, regular services and labour for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> had been already begun; the number of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> steadily increased, and under Rutski &#151; who had meanwhile been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> &#151; there began the regeneration of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> among the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>. In 1609, after private study under the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/05745a.htm">Fabricius</a>, Josaphat was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He subsequently became superior in several <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">monasteries</a>, and on 12 November, 1617, was reluctantly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vitebsk, with <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of succession to the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archbishopric</a> of Polotsk. He became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in 1618.

<p>While each succeeding year saw fresh evidence of his fruitful labours, it also witnessed the steady growth of the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> party. Finally on 12 November, 1623, an axe-stroke and a bullet brought Josaphat his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> crown. After numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> had occurred, a commission was appointed by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> in 1628 to inquire into the cause of Josaphat, and examined on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> 116 witnesses. Although five years had elapsed since Josaphat's death, his body was still incorrupt. In 1637 a second commission investigated the life of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, and in 1643 &#151; twenty years after his death &#151; Josaphat was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a>. His <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> took place in 1867.

<p>Great were the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. As a boy he shunned the usual games of childhood, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> much, and lost no opportunity of assisting at the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Divine services</a>. Children especially regarded him with the greatest affection, and found in him a worthy model. As an apprentice, he devoted every leisure hour to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and study. At first Popovyc viewed this behaviour with displeasure, but Josaphat gradually won such a position in his esteem, that Popovyc offered him his entire <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">fortune</a> and his daughter's hand. But Josaphat's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> never wavered. At first without a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> guide along the paths of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, he received all <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual direction</a> immediately from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p>His favourite pious exercise was to make a <em>poklony</em> (i.e. a <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">reverence</a>, in which the head touches the ground) with the ejaculation: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, have mercy on me, a poor <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinner</a>." Never eating meat, he <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> much, wore a <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">hair-shirt</a> and an angular chain, slept on the bare floor, and chastised his body until the blood flowed. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> frequently urged him to set some bounds to his <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">austerities</a>.

<p>From his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> study of the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> he drew many proofs of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, using his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the composition of several works &#151; "On the Baptism of St. Volodymyr"; "On the Falsification of the Slavic Books by the Enemies of the Metropolitan"; "On Monks and their Vows". As <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he was distinguished by his extraordinary <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in the service of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Not alone in the church did he preach and hear <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a>, but likewise in the fields, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a>, and even on his journeys. Even where his words of instruction might by themselves have failed, his entreaties and tears ensured him success. This <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, united with his kindness and extraordinary <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, won numbers to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Catholic Faith</a>. Among his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a> were included many important personages such as Ignatius, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, and Emmanuel Cantacuzenus, who belonged to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Greek</a> Emperor Pal&aelig;ologus.

<p>As <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> he restored the churches; issued a catechism to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> with instructions that it should be learned by heart; composed rules for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> life, entrusting to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> the task of superintending their observance; assembled <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> in various towns in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and firmly opposed the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Imperial</a> Chancellor Sapieha, when he wished to make many concessions in favour of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatics</a>. Throughout all his strivings and all his occupations, he continued his exemplary <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">life as a religious</a>, and never abated his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">self-mortification</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.

<p>He awaited death with a certain yearning, refusing to avail himself of the opportunity of flight afforded him. After his death his influence was still greater: <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversions</a> were numerous, and veneration for him continued to extend. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on the first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> after 12 November, according to the Julian Calendar. <span class="stiki"><em>Note:</em> His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is currently kept on November 12 on the Universal Calendar.</span>
