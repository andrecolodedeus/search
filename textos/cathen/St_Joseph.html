<h1>St. Joseph</h1>  

<p>Spouse of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a> and foster-father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.
<h2>Life</h2>
<h3>Sources</h3>

<p>The chief sources of information on the life of St. Joseph are the first chapters of our <a href="../cathen/10057a.htm">first</a> and <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">third</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>; they are practically also the only reliable sources, for, whilst, on the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> patriarch's life, as on many other points connected with the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour's</a> history which are left untouched by the canonical writings, the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal literature</a> is full of details, the non-admittance of these works into the <a href="../cathen/03274a.htm">Canon of the Sacred Books</a> casts a strong suspicion upon their contents; and, even granted that some of the facts recorded by them may be founded on trustworthy traditions, it is in most instances next to impossible to discern and sift these particles of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> history from the fancies with which they are associated. Among these <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> productions dealing more or less extensively with some episodes of St. Joseph's life may be noted the so-called <a href="../fathers/0847.htm">"Gospel of James"</a>, the <a href="../fathers/0848.htm">"Pseudo-Matthew"</a>, the <a href="../fathers/0849.htm">"Gospel of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary"</a>, the <a href="../fathers/0805.htm">"Story of Joseph the Carpenter"</a>, and the "Life of the Virgin and Death of Joseph".
<h3>Genealogy</h3>

<p><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs16">St. Matthew (1:16)</a> calls St. Joseph the son of Jacob; according to <a href="../bible/luk013.htm#vrs23">St. Luke (3:23)</a>, <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a> was his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. This is not the place to recite the many and most various endeavours to solve the vexing questions arising from the divergences between both <a href="../cathen/06408a.htm">genealogies</a>; nor is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to point out the explanation which meets best all the requirements of the problem (see <a href="../cathen/06410a.htm">G<font size=-2>ENEALOGY OF</font> C<font size=-2>HRIST</font></a>); suffice it to remind the reader that, contrary to what was once advocated, most modern writers readily admit that in both documents we possess the <a href="../cathen/06408a.htm">genealogy</a> of Joseph, and that it is quite possible to reconcile their data.
<h3>Residence</h3>

<p>At any rate, <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, the city of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and his descendants, appears to have been the birth-place of Joseph. When, however, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> history opens, namely, a few months before the <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation</a>, Joseph was settled at <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>. Why and when he forsook his home-place to betake himself to <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> is not ascertained; some suppose &#151; and the supposition is by no means improbable &#151; that the then-moderate circumstances of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of earning a living may have brought about the change. St. Joseph, indeed, was a <em>tekton</em>, as we learn from <a href="../bible/mat013.htm#vrs55">Matthew 13:55</a>, and <a href="../bible/mar006.htm#vrs3">Mark 6:3</a>. The word means both mechanic in general and carpenter in particular; <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> vouches for the latter sense (<a href="../fathers/01286.htm"><em>Dialogue with Trypho</em> 88</a>), and <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> has accepted this interpretation, which is followed in the <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">English Bible</a>.
<h3>Marriage</h3>

<p>It is probably at <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a> that Joseph <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> and married her who was to become the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>. When the marriage took place, whether before or after the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, is no easy matter to settle, and on this point the masters of <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> have at all times been at variance. Most modern <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commentators</a>, following the footsteps of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, understand that, at the epoch of the <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> was only <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">affianced</a> to Joseph; as <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> notices, this interpretation suits better all the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">evangelical</a> data.

<p>It will not be without interest to recall here, unreliable though they are, the lengthy stories concerning St. Joseph's marriage contained in the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal writings</a>. When forty years of age, Joseph married a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> called Melcha or Escha by some, Salome by others; they lived forty-nine years together and had six children, two daughters and four sons, the youngest of whom was <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a> (the Less, <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">"the Lord's brother"</a>). A year after his wife's death, as the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> announced through <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> that they wished to find in the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Juda</a> a respectable man to espouse <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, then twelve to fourteen years of age. Joseph, who was at the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> ninety years old, went up to Jerusalem among the candidates; a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> manifested the choice <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had made of Joseph, and two years later the <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation</a> took place. These dreams, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> styles them, from which many a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> artist has drawn his inspiration (see, for instance, <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael's</a> "Espousals of the Virgin"), are void of authority; they nevertheless acquired in the course of ages some popularity; in them some <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers sought the answer to the well-known difficulty arising from the mention in the Gospel of <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">"the Lord's brothers"</a>; from them also popular credulity has, contrary to all probability, as well as to the tradition witnessed by old works of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a>, retained the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that St. Joseph was an old man at the time of marriage with the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>.
<h3>The Incarnation</h3>

<p>This marriage, true and complete, was, in the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the spouses, to be <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> marriage (cf. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, "De cons. Evang.", II, i in P.L. XXXIV, 1071-72; "Cont. Julian.", V, xii, 45 in P.L. XLIV, 810; <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, <a href="../summa/4028.htm">III:28</a>; <a href="../summa/4029.htm">III:29:2</a>). But soon was the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Joseph in his spouse to be sorely tried: she was with child. However painful the discovery must have been for him, unaware as he was of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">mystery of the Incarnation</a>, his delicate feelings forbade him to defame his affianced, and he resolved "to put her away privately; but while he thought on these things, behold the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> appeared to him in his sleep, saying: Joseph, son of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not to take unto thee <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> thy wife, for that which is conceived in her, is of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. . . And Joseph, rising from his sleep, did as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> had commanded him, and took unto him his wife" (<a href="../bible/mat001.htm#vrs19">Matthew 1:19, 20, 24</a>).
<h3>The Nativity and the flight to Egypt</h3>

<p>A few months later, the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> came for Joseph and Mary to go to <a href="../cathen/02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a>, to be enrolled, according to the decree issued by <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Caesar Augustus</a>: a new source of anxiety for Joseph, for "her days were accomplished, that she should be delivered", and "there was no room for them in the inn (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#vrs1">Luke 2:1-7</a>). What must have been the thoughts of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man at the birth of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, the coming of the shepherds and of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">wise men</a>, and at the events which occurred at the time of the Presentation of Jesus in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple</a>, we can merely guess; <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">St. Luke</a> tells only that he was "wondering at those things which were spoken concerning him" (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#vrs33">2:33</a>). New trials were soon to follow. The news that a <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">king of the Jews</a> was born could not but kindle in the wicked heart of the old and bloody tyrant, <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, the fire of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">jealousy</a>. Again "an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> appeared in sleep to Joseph, saying: Arise, and take the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">child</a> and his <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">mother</a>, and fly into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: and be there until I shall tell thee" (<a href="../bible/mat002.htm#vrs13">Matthew 2:13</a>).
<h3>Return to Nazareth</h3>

<p>The summons to go back to Palestine came only after a few years, and the Holy Family settled again at <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>. St. Joseph's was henceforth the simple and uneventful life of an <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, supporting himself and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> by his work, and faithful to the religious practices commanded by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> or observed by <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>. The only noteworthy incident recorded by the Gospel is the loss of, and anxious quest for, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, then twelve years old, when He had strayed during the yearly <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Holy City</a> (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#vrs42">Luke 2:42-51</a>).
<h3>Death</h3>

<p>This is the last we hear of St. Joseph in the <a href="../bible/index.html">sacred writings</a>, and we may well suppose that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus's</a> foster-father died before the beginning of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Savior's</a> public life. In several circumstances, indeed, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> speak of the latter's <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">mother</a> and <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brothers</a> (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#vrs46">Matthew 12:46</a>; <a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs31">Mark 3:31</a>; <a href="../bible/luk008.htm#vrs19">Luke 8:19</a>; <a href="../bible/joh007.htm#vrs3">John 7:3</a>), but never do they speak of His father in connection with the rest of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; they tell us only that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, during His public life, was referred to as the son of Joseph (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs45">John 1:45</a>; <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#vrs42">6:42</a>; <a href="../bible/luk004.htm#vrs22">Luke 4:22</a>) the carpenter (<a href="../bible/mat013.htm#vrs55">Matthew 13:55</a>). Would <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, moreover, when about to die on the Cross, have entrusted His <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">mother</a> to John's care, had St. Joseph been still alive?



<p>According to the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> "Story of Joseph the Carpenter", the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man reached his hundred and eleventh year when he died, on 20 July (A.D. 18 or 19). <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> gives him ninety years of age at the time of his demise; and if we are to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a>, he was buried in the <a href="../cathen/08503a.htm">Valley of Josaphat</a>. In truth we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> when St. Joseph died; it is most unlikely that he attained the ripe old age spoken of by the <a href="../fathers/0805.htm">"Story of Joseph"</a> and <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>. The probability is that he died and was buried at <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>.
<h2>Devotion to Saint Joseph</h2>

<p>Joseph was "a just man". This praise bestowed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a> of having been chosen by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be the foster-father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and the spouse of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mother</a>, are the foundations of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> paid to St. Joseph by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. So well-grounded are these foundations that it is not a little surprising that the cult of St. Joseph was so slow in winning recognition. Foremost among the causes of this is the fact that "during the first centuries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, it was only the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who enjoyed veneration" (Kellner). Far from being ignored or passed over in silence during the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ages, St. Joseph's prerogatives were occasionally descanted upon by the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>; even such eulogies as cannot be attributed to the writers among whose works they found admittance bear witness that the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and devotion therein expressed were familiar, not only to the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and preachers, and must have been readily welcomed by the people. The earliest traces of public recognition of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of St. Joseph are to be found in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">East</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a>, if we may trust the assertions of Papebroch, was kept by the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> as early as the beginning of the fourth century. Nicephorus Callistus tells likewise &#151; on what authority we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> &#151; that in the great <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> erected at Bethlehem by <a href="../cathen/07202b.htm">St. Helena</a>, there was a gorgeous <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratory</a> <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of our saint. Certain it is, at all events, that the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of "Joseph the Carpenter" is entered, on 20 July, in one of the old Coptic <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">Calendars</a> in our possession, as also in a <a href="../cathen/14382b.htm">Synazarium</a> of the eighth and nineth century published by <a href="../cathen/09538a.htm">Cardinal Mai</a> (Script. Vet. Nova Coll., IV, 15 sqq.). Greek <a href="../cathen/10191b.htm">menologies</a> of a later date at least mention St. Joseph on 25 or 26 December, and a twofold <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">commemoration</a> of him along with other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> was made on the two <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> next before and after <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a> the name of the foster-father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> (<em>Nutritor Domini</em>) appears in local <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> of the ninth and tenth centuries, and we find in 1129, for the first time, a church <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> at Bologna. The devotion, then merely private, as it seems, gained a great impetus owing to the influence and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of such <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">saintly</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, <a href="../cathen/06534a.htm">St. Gertrude</a> (d. 1310), and <a href="../cathen/02782a.htm">St. Bridget of Sweden</a> (d. 1373). According to <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (De Serv. Dei beatif., I, iv, n. 11; xx, n. 17), "the general opinion of the learned is that the Fathers of Carmel were the first to import from the East into the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a> the laudable practice of giving the fullest cultus to St. Joseph". His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a>, introduced towards the end shortly afterwards, into the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Calendar, gradually gained a foothold in various <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Europe</a>. Among the most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> promoters of the devotion at that epoch, <a href="../cathen/15437a.htm">St. Vincent Ferrer</a> (d. 1419), <a href="../cathen/01235b.htm">Peter d'Ailly</a> (d. 1420), <a href="../cathen/02505b.htm">St. Bernadine of Siena</a> (d. 1444), and <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Jehan Charlier Gerson</a> (d. 1429) deserve an especial mention. <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a>, who had, in 1400, composed an Office of the Espousals of Joseph particularly at the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> (1414), in promoting the public recognition of the cult of St. Joseph. Only under the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> (1471-84), were the efforts of these <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men rewarded by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">Calendar</a> (19 March). From that <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the devotion acquired greater and greater popularity, the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> keeping pace with this steady growth. At first only a <em>festum simplex</em>, it was soon elevated to a double rite by <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a> (1484-92), declared by <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a>, in 1621, a <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">festival</a> of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, at the instance of the Emperors Ferdinand III and Leopold I and of King Charles II of Spain, and raised to the rank of a double of the second class by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> (1700-21). Further, <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, in 1726, inserted the name into the <a href="../cathen/09291a.htm">Litany of the Saints</a>.

<p>One <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">festival</a> in the year, however, was not deemed enough to satisfy the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the people. The <a href="../cathen/05543a.htm">feast of the Espousals of the Blessed Virgin and St. Joseph</a>, so strenuously advocated by <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a>, and permitted first by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, then to other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and individual <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, was, in 1725, granted to all countries that solicited it, a proper Office, compiled by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Pierto Aurato, being assigned, and the day appointed being 23 January. Nor was this all, for the reformed <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Order of Carmelites</a>, into which <a href="../cathen/14515b.htm">St. Teresa</a> had infused her great devotion to the foster-father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, chose him, in 1621, for their <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron</a>, and in 1689, were allowed to celebrate the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of his Patronage on the third <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> after <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. This <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a>, soon adopted throughout the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish Kingdom</a>, was later on extended to all states and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> which asked for the <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a>. No devotion, perhaps, has grown so universal, none seems to have appealed so forcibly to the heart of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people, and particularly of the labouring classes, during the nineteenth century, as that of St. Joseph.

<p>This wonderful and unprecedented increase of popularity called for a new lustre to be added to the cult of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. Accordingly, one of the first acts of the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, himself singularly devoted to <a href="../cathen/13356b.htm">St. Joseph</a>, was to extend to the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the Patronage (1847), and in December, 1870, according to the wishes of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and of all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, he solemnly declared the Holy Patriarch Joseph, <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and enjoined that his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> (19 March) should henceforth be celebrated as a double of the first class (but without <a href="../cathen/11204a.htm">octave</a>, on account of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>). Following the footsteps of their predecessor, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> have shown an equal desire to add their own jewel to the crown of St. Joseph: the former, by permitting on certain days the reading of the <a href="../cathen/15510a.htm">votive Office</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>; and the latter by approving, on 18 March, 1909, a <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of him whose <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">name</a> he had received in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.
