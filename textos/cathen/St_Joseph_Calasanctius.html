<h1>St. Joseph Calasanctius</h1>  

<p>Called in religion "a Matre Dei", founder of the <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarists</a>, b. 11 Sept., 1556, at the castle of Calasanza near Petralta de la Sal in <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>; d. 25 Aug., 1648, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; feast 27 Aug. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, Don Pedro Calasanza and Donna Maria Gastonia, gave Joseph, the youngest of five children, a good <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at home and then at the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Petralta. After his classical studies at Estadilla he took up philosophy and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> at <a href="../cathen/09188a.htm">L&eacute;rida</a> and merited the degree of Doctor of Laws, and then with honours completed his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course at Valencia and Alcal&aacute; de Henares. His mother and brother having died, Don Pedro wanted Joseph to marry and perpetuate the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> interfered by sending a sickness in 1582 which soon brought Joseph to the brink of the grave. On his recovery he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 17 Dec., 1583, by Hugo Ambrose de Moncada, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15223b.htm">Urgel</a>. Joseph began his labours as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the Diocese of Albarracin, where Bishop della Figuera appointed him his <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and confessor, synodal examiner, and <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>, and when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was transferred to L&eacute;rida his <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> followed him to the new diocese. In 1586 della Figuera was sent as Apostolic visitator to the Abbey of Montserrat, and Joseph accompanied him as secretary. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> died the following year and Joseph left, though urgently requested to remain. He hurried to Calasanza only to be present at the death of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. He was then called by his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15223b.htm">Urgel</a> to act as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> for the district of Trempe. In 1592 he embarked for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he found a protector in Cardinal Marcantonio Colonna who chose him as his <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and instructor to his nephew. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> offered a splendid field for <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>, especially for the instruction of neglected and homeless children, many of whom had lost their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. Joseph joined a <a href="../cathen/03711b.htm">Confraternity of Christian Doctrine</a> and gathered the boys and girls from the streets and brought them to <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The teachers, being poorly paid, refused to accept the additional labour without remuneration. The <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of S. Dorotea, Anthony Brendani, offered him two rooms and promised assistance in teaching, and when two other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> promised similar help, Joseph, in November, 1597, opened the first public free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Pope Clement VIII</a> gave an annual contribution and many others shared in the good work, so that in a short time Joseph had about a thousand children under his charge. In 1602 he rented a house at S. Andrea della Valle and commenced a community life with his assistants and laid the foundation of the Order of <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarists</a>. Much <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and opposition arose against him and his new institute, but all were overcome in time. In 1612 the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was transferred to the Torres palace adjoining S. Pantaleone. Here Joseph spent the remaining years of his life in his chosen calling. He lived and died a faithful son of the church, a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> friend of forsaken children. His body rests in S. Paltaleone. His <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> was solemnized on 7 Aug., 1748, and his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> by <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a>, 16 July, 1767.
