<h1>St. Joseph of Cupertino</h1>  

<p>Mystic, born 17 June, 1603; died at <a href="../cathen/11338a.htm">Osimo</a> 18 September, 1663; feast, 18 September. Joseph received his surname from Cupertino, a small village in the Diocese of Nard&ograve;, lying between <a href="../cathen/02787e.htm">Brindisi</a> and <a href="../cathen/11351c.htm">Otranto</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>. His father Felice Desa, a poor carpenter, died before Joseph was born and left some <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a>, in consequence of which the creditors drove the mother, Francesca Panara, from her home, and she was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to give birth to her child in a stable. In his eighth year Joseph had an <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">ecstatic vision</a> while at <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and this was renewed several times; so that the children, seeing him gape and stare on such occasions, lost to all things about him, gave him the sobriquet "Bocca Aperta". At the same time he had a hot and irascible temper which his strict mother strove hard to overcome. He was apprenticed to a shoemaker, but at the age of seventeen he tried to be admitted to the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a> and was refused on account of his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. He then applied to the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> at Martino near Tarento, where he was accepted as a lay-brother in 1620, but his continual <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasies</a> unfitted him for work and he was dismissed. His mother and his uncles abused him as a good-for-nothing, but Joseph did not lose hope. By his continued <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and tears he succeeded in obtaining permission to work in the stable as lay help or oblate at the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of La Grotella near Cupertino. He now gave evidence of great virtues, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, obedience, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of penance to such an extent that he was admitted to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> state in 1625, and three years later, on 28 March he was raised to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Joseph was but little versed in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, for his biographers relate that he was able to read but poorly, yet infused by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> light he not only surpassed all ordinary men in the learning of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> but could solve the most intricate questions.

<p>His life was now one long succession of visions and other heavenly favours. Everything that in any way had reference to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or holy things would bring on an <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstatic</a> state: the sound of a bell or of <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a>, the mention of the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> or of a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, any event in the life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the sacred Passion, a holy picture, the thought of the glory in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, all would put Joseph into contemplation. Neither dragging him about, buffeting, piercing with needles, nor even burning his flesh with candles would have any effect on him &#151; only the voice of his superior would make him obey. These conditions would occur at any time or place, especially at Mass or during Divine Service. Frequently he would be raised from his feet and remain suspended in the air. Besides he would at times hear heavenly music. Since such occurrences in public caused much admiration and also disturbance in a community, Joseph for thirty-five years was not allowed to attend choir, go to the common refectory, walk in procession or say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in church, but was ordered to remain in his room, where a private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was prepared for him. Evil-minded and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> men even brought him before the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, and he was sent from one lonely house of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> or <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> to another, but Joseph retained his resigned and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyous</a> spirit, submitting confidently to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>. He practised <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> to such a degree, that he kept seven <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lents</a> of forty days each year, and during many of them tasted no food except on Thursdays and <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>. His body is in the church at <a href="../cathen/11338a.htm">Osimo</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> in 1753, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> 16 July 1767 by <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a>; <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a> extended his office to the entire Church. His life was written by Robert Nuti (Palermo, 1678). Angelo Pastrovicchi wrote another in 1773, and this is used by the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandist</a> "Acta SS.", V, Sept., 992.
