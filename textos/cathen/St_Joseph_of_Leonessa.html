<h1>St. Joseph of Leonessa</h1>  

<p>In the world <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">named</a> Eufranio Desiderio; born in 1556 at Leonessa in Umbria; died 4 February, 1612. From his infancy he showed a remarkably <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">religious</a> bent of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>; he used to erect little <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altars</a> and spend much <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> before them, and often he would gather his companions and induce them to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with him. Whilst yet a boy he used to take the discipline on Fridays in company with the <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternity</a> of St. Saviour. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by his uncle, who had planned a suitable <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriage</a> for him, but in his sixteenth year he fell sick of a fever, and on his recovery, without consulting his relative, he joined the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin reform</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>. He made his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Carcerelle near <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>. As a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> he was remarkable for his great <a href="../cathen/01067a.htm">abstinence</a>. "Brother Ass", he would say to his body, "there is no need to feed thee as a noble horse would be fed: thou must be content to be a poor ass." In 1599, the year before his <a href="../cathen/08531c.htm">Jubilee year</a>, he <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> the whole year by way of preparation for gaining the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>. In 1587 he was sent by the Superior General of his order to Constantinople to minister to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> held captive there. Arrived there he and his companions lodged in a derelict house of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> in which the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> lived attracted the attention of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, who went in numbers to see the new missionaries. He was very solicitous in ministering to the captive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the galleys. Every day he went into the city to preach, and he was at length thrown into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and only released at the intervention of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> agent. Urged on by <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> he at last sought to enter the palace to preach before the Sultan, but he was seized and condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>. For three days he hung on the gallows, held up by two hooks driven through his right hand and foot; then he was <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> released by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Returning to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, he took with him a <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> who had <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a>, and who was reconciled to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on their arrival in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Joseph now took up the work of home missions in his native province, sometimes preaching six or seven times a day. In the <a href="../cathen/08531c.htm">Jubilee year</a> of 1600 he preached the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> at Otricoli, a town through which crowds of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> passed on their way to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Many of them being very <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, Joseph supplied them with food; he also washed their clothes and cut their hair. At <a href="../cathen/14754a.htm">Todi</a> he cultivated with his own hands a garden, the produce of which was for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 4 February throughout the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>.
