<h1>St. Joseph's Society for Foreign Missions</h1>  

<p>(Mill Hill, <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, N.W.)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> whose object is to labour for the conversion of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> in foreign countries. It owes its origin to <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a> (d. 1903) who, when still but a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, founded in 1866 St. Joseph's Missionary College in a villa near Mill Hill, about ten miles north of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. It was the purpose of this college to train missionaries to propagate the Gospel among unevangelized races beyond <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, especially the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> of Africa and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of America</a>. On 1 March, 1871, the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was transferred to a larger building erected for the purpose at Mill Hill, and in 1884 St. Peter's School was founded at Freshfield near <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, to serve as a preparatory <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> to the college at Mill Hill. There are two other branch colleges: St. Joseph's Missiehuis, at Rozendaal, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, erected in 1890; and St. Josef's Missionshaus, at <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a>, Tyrol, erected in 1891. St. Joseph's Society, Mill Hill, is under the direction of the superior general, Very Rev. Francis Henry, and comprises at present about 200 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 10 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>. About 170 of these <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are engaged as missionaries, the others as teachers in the above named colleges. The following missions are under the care of the Society: the Telugu Mission in the <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Archdiocese of Madras</a> in British <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, since 1875; the Prefecture Apostolic of Labuan and North Borneo, since 1881; the Maori Mission in the <a href="../cathen/02068a.htm">Diocese of Auckland</a>, <a href="../cathen/11040a.htm">New Zealand</a>, since 1886; the Prefecture Apostolic of Kafiristan and Kashmir in the northern part of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, since 1887; the Vicariate Apostolic of the Upper Nile or Uganda in British East Africa, since 1894; a few stations in the <a href="../cathen/04228a.htm">Belgian Congo</a>, since 1903; and in the <a href="../cathen/08323d.htm">Diocese of Jaro</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a>, since 1906, there are about thirty <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. The rules and constitutions of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> received the final definite approval of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, 25 April, 1908.
<h2>Sisters of St. Joseph's Society for Foreign Missions</h2>

<p>Of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> Regular of St. Francis, founded in 1883 by <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a> and Mother Mary Francis Ingham, to co-operate in the work of the Mill Hill Fathers. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was that the sisters should stand in the same relation to the fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> as the <a href="../cathen/03605a.htm">Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> Fathers. They undertake any work, at home or abroad, indicated for them by the superior general or the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. There are no lay sisters. The <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> is at Patricraft, <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, where the sisters have also homes for boys and girls and a nursery, with about 200 children under 40 sisters. In addition to their establishments at Mill Hill and Manchester, the congregation has a branch house at Blackburn with boarding-schools for boys and girls of the middle class and an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> for children of the poorer class, with 10 sisters in charge of 70 to 80 children; at Blackburn the sisters teach in 3 elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. They have branches also at Freshfield (Liverpool), at Waterford and <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and at Rozendaal in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. In Borneo there are 17 sisters at various mission stations. The total number of professed sisters in the congregation is 120.
