<h1>St. Justus</h1>  

<p>Fourth <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>; died 627 (?). For the particulars of his life we are almost entirely dependent on <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede's</a> "Historia Ecclesiastica", the additions of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> writers, such as <a href="../cathen/15633d.htm">William of Malmesbury</a> or Elmham, possessing no authority. Justus was one of the second band of missionaries sent by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, the company which arrived in 601 to reinforce St. Augustine and which conveyed the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, books, <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a>, and other gifts sent by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. It is not certain whether he was a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a> or a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede</a> is silent on the point and only later monastic writers from <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> claim him as one of their own order. In 604 he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by St. Augustine as first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rochester, on which occasion King Ethelbert bestowed on the new see, by charter, a territory called Priestfield and other lands. Other charters in which his name occurs are of dubious authenticity. After the death of Augustine, Justus joined with the new <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, St. Laurence, and with <a href="../cathen/10168b.htm">Mellitus of London</a> in addressing letters to the recalcitrant British <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but without effect. During the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> reaction which followed the death of Ethelbert, Justus was expelled from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> and took refuge in Gaul for a year, after which he was recalled by Eadbald who had been converted by St. Laurence. On the death of <a href="../cathen/10168b.htm">St. Mellitus</a> (24 April, 624) who had succeeded St. Laurence as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, St. Justus was elected to the vacant primacy. The letter which <a href="../cathen/02661a.htm">Pope Boniface</a> addressed to him when sending him the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> is preserved by <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> (H. F., II, 8). He was already an old man, and little is recorded of his pontificate except that he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Romanus as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rochester and St. Paulinus as Bishop for the North. His anniversary was kept at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> on 10 November, but there is uncertainty as to the year of his death, though 627, the commonly received date, would appear to be correct, especially as it fits in with the period of three years usually assigned by the chroniclers to his archiepiscopate. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> with his predecessors at St. Augustine's Abbey, <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, and is commemorated in the English supplement to the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> and <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> on 10 November.
