<h1>St. Kentigern</h1>  

<p>(Or M<font size=-2>UNGO</font>)

<p>Bishop, founder of the See of <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>, b. about 518; d. at <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>, 13 January, 603. His mother Thenaw was daughter of a British prince, Lothus (from whom the province of Lothian was called); his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> name is unknown. According to Jocelyn's life of Kentigern, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was born at Culross in Fife, and brought up until manhood by St. Serf (or Servanus) at his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> there; but Skene shows that this connection between the two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> involves an anachronism, as St. Serf really belongs to the following century. At the age of twenty-five we find Kentigern (the name means "head chief", but he was popularly known as Mungo &mdash; in Cymric, Mwyn-gu, or "dear one"), beginning his missionary labours at Cathures, on the Clyde, the site of modern Glasgow. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> King of Strathclyde, Roderick Hael, welcomed the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, and procured his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, which took place about 540. For some thirteen years he laboured in the district, living a most austere life in a cell at the confluence of the Clyde and the Molendinar, and making many converts by his holy example and his preaching. A large community grew up around him, became known as "Clasgu" (meaning the "dear <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>") and ultimately grew into the town and city of <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>.

<p>About 553 a strong anti-Christian movement in Strathclyde compelled Kentigern to leave the district, and he retired to <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, staying for a time with <a href="../cathen/04640b.htm">St. David</a> at <a href="../cathen/10187d.htm">Menevia</a>, and afterwards founding a large <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Llanelwy, now <a href="../cathen/01766a.htm">St. Asaph's</a>, of which he appointed the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="../cathen/01766a.htm">Asaph</a> superior in succession to himself. In 573 the battle of Arthuret secured the triumph of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> cause in Cumbria, and Kentigern, at the earnest appeal of King Roderick, returned thither, accompanied by many of his <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> disciples. For eight years he fixed his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> at Hoddam in Dumfriesshire, evangelizing thence the districts of <a href="../cathen/06370a.htm">Galloway</a> and Cumberland. About 581 he finally returned to <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>, and here, a year or two later, he was visited by <a href="../cathen/04136a.htm">St. Columba</a>, who was at that time labouring in Strathtay. The two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> embraced, held long converse, and exchanged their pastoral staves.

<p>Kentigern was buried on the spot where now stands the beautiful <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> dedicated in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. His remains are said still to rest in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a>. His festival is kept throughout <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> on 13 January. The <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> have printed a special mass for this feast, dating from the thirteenth century.
