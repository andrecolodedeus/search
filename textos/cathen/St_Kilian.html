<h1>St. Kilian</h1>  

<p>(Killena, Cill&iacute;ne).

<p>Apostle of Franconia and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, born about 640 of noble <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> probably in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> (according to others in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> though <em>Scottica tellus</em>, as it is called by the elder "Passio", may also in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> times have meant <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The later "Passio" says: "Scotia qu&aelig; et Hibernia dicitur"); died 8 July, probably in 689. He was distinguished from his youth for his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of study, and, according to the later "Passio", embraced the monastic life. <a href="../cathen/15062a.htm">Trithemius</a> and later writers say that he was a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in the celebrated <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Hy</a>: that he was later the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> is also held by <a href="../cathen/15062a.htm">Trithemius</a>; however, that, a supposition, cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. The statement in the older "Passio" that Kilian was raised to the purple before leaving his native land may be accepted as trustworthy, although the later "Passio" refers this event to his sojourn in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In accordance with the custom then prevailing in the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church, he was assigned to no particular diocese, but was district <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or travelling <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. One day he made up his mind to be a missionary, left his native country with eleven companions, travelled through Gaul, thence across the Rhine, and finally reached the castle of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, inhabited by the Thuringian (<a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a>) Duke Gozbert, who was, like his people, still <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>. Kilian resolved to preach the Gospel here, but first journeyed with his companions to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to receive missionary faculties from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. <a href="../cathen/08422c.htm">John V</a>, whom he expected to find, had died meanwhile (2 August, 686), and was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/04258a.htm">Conon</a> from whom Kilian obtained his faculties. From the sources already cited, we learn that the arrival of St. Kilian and his companions at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> and the journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> occurred in the summer of 686, that they arrived in the latter city in the late autumn, and that their labours at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> continued during 687 and the following years. The original group separated on the return journey &#151; some departing to seek other fields of missionary work, while St. Kilian with two companions, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Coloman and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Totnan, came back to <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>. He took this town as the base of his activity, which extended over an ever-increasing area in East Franconia and Thuringia, and converted Duke Gozbert with a large part of his subjects to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Concerning the cause of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the three missionaries, the early documents supply the following information: After Duke Gozbert had become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, St. Kilian explained to him that his marriage with Geilana, his brother's <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, was unlawful under the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian dispensation</a>, and secured the duke's promise to separate from her. In consequence of this action, Geilana plotted vengeance against the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, and caused him and his two companions to be secretly <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> in the absence of the duke, their corpses being immediately buried at the scene of the crime together with the <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a>, vestments, and holy writings. This is generally held to have happened on 8 July, 689, although opinions vary as to the exact year. The early documents relate further that, after the duke's return, Geilana at first denied any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what had become of the missionaries; the murderer, however, went mad, confessed his crime, and died miserably, Geilana also dying insane. Recent critics, especially Hauck and Riezler (see bibliography), question without sufficient grounds the authenticity of these statements in the matter of detail, especially as regards the cause and the immediate circumstances of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the three missionaries. Through prejudice against the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> party has also disputed the absolutely reliable information about the journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> undertaken by St. Kilian and his assistants. His missionary labours through Eastern Franconia and his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> are, however, accepted without question by everyone. Although Kilian's work was not continued after his death, <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> on his arrival in Thuringia found at least evidence of his predecessor's influence. The <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the three <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, after wonderful cures had brought renown to their burial place, were transferred in 743 by Saint Burchard, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Our Lady, where they were temporarily <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a>. Later, when Burchard had obtained Pope Zachary's permission for their public veneration, they were solemnly transferred &#151; probably on 8 July, 752 &#151; to the newly finished Cathedral of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>. Still later they were buried in St. Kilian's vault in the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> erected on the spot where tradition affirms the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> to have taken place. The <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> belonging to St. Kilian was preserved among the treasures of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> until 1803, and since then has been in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. Kilian is the <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated in <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> on 8 July with great solemnity.

<p>The chief source of information is the older and shorter "Passio" (which begins "Fuit vir vit&aelig; venerabilis Killena nomine"), formerly considered to date from the tenth or ninth century. Emmerich (after the example of the "Histoire litt&eacute;raire de la France", IV, Paris, 1738, p. 86), and Hefner (see below) on very good grounds now connect the appearance of this chronicle with the solemn translation of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> in 752, which raises its historic value beyond the reach of attack. The later and more voluminous "Passio" is an amplified and embellished version of the earlier one and cannot be relied upon when the accounts differ. Both have been published by H. Canisius, "Antiquae lectiones", IV, pt. ii (Ingolstadt, 1603), pp. 625-47; by <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a>, "Acta Sanctorum O.S.B.", II (Paris, 1669), p. 991-3; in the "Acta Sanctorum" for 8 July (see below), and finally, with a collection of later sources and with the office of St. Kilian of the <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> Church, by Emmerich (see below).
