<h1>St. Lambert</h1>  

<p>(LANDEBERTUS).

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maestricht, b. at Maestricht between 633 and 638; d. at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, between 698 and 701. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, who belonged to the nobility, gave him a very religious <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and chose as his preceptor St. Landoaldus, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> at Maestricht. Later, Lambert received instruction from St. Theodardus (668 or 669), whom he succeeded in 670 as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maestricht. During the calamitous days of Ebroin, Mayor of the Palace, Lambert, having defended the interests of King Childeric, was forced to flee from Maestricht. While Pharamundus administered his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, Lambert spent seven years (674-681) in the well-known Abbey of Stavelot, where he edified the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> by his saintly life. In 681 Ebroin received his well-earned retribution, and Pepin of Heristal became mayor of the palace, at first of Austrasia, but in 687 of the whole domain of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>. Pepin, who liked Lambert, permitted him to return to Maestricht and resume the administration of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Some time later we find Lambert as a missionary in Toxandria, the Kempenland and Brabant of today. In order to spread the Gospel, he descended the River Meuse as far as Tiel and laboured along its banks in company with <a href="../cathen/15645a.htm">St. Willibrord</a>, who had come from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 691. It is very probable that Lambert came in contact with Sts. Wiro, Plechelmus, and Otger, who had built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the Pietersburg, later called the Odilienberg, near Roermond. St. Landrada aided Lambert in founding the Abbey of Munsterbilsen. For several centuries a controversy has been carried on concerning the manner of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> death. According to tradition, Lambert became a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> to his defence of marital fidelity. The <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>, <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a>, Valois, Lecointe, Pagi and others held, however, that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was killed by <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> nobles in revenge for the failure of a plundering expedition. Kurth in 1876 critically examined the centuries-old tradition and, documents in hand, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> beyond further <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that Lambert was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> because of his defence of the marriage tie. Pepin of Heristal lived for many years in irreproachable wedlock with the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Plectrude, who bore him two sons. Later he entered into unlawful relations with Alpais, who became the mother of <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a>. When no one had the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to remonstrate with Pepin, Lambert went to his court like another <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>. Alpais, fearing that Pepin might heed the admonitions of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, appealed to her brother Dodo. The latter sought revenge and caused Lambert to be assassinated in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of Sts. Cosmas and Damian, built by St. Monulphus at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>. His heart was pierced by a javelin while he was at the altar. The servants of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> placed his remains in a vessel, descended the Meuse to Maestricht, and buried them in the cemetery of St. Peter, in the vault of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, Aper and Herisplindis, beneath the walls of Maestricht. Between 714 and 723, <a href="../cathen/07507a.htm">St. Hubert</a> exhumed the remains and had them translated to <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, whither he had transferred, presumably as early as 723, his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. The saint's feast is celebrated on 17 Sept. A large number of churches have St. Lambert as their patron.
