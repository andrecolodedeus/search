<h1>St. Lawrence</h1>  

<p>Second <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, d. 2 Feb., 619. For the particulars of his life and pontificate we rely exclusively on details added by <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> writers being unsupported by historical evidence, though they may possibly embody ancient traditions. According to <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede</a>, he was one of the original missionaries who left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with St. Augustine in 595 and finally landed in Thanet in 597. After St. Augustine had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> he sent St. Lawrence back to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to carry to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the news of the conversion of King Ethelbert and his people, to announce his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, and to ask for direction on certain questions. In this passage of the historian St. Lawrence is referred to as <em>presbyter</em>, in distinction to Peter who is called <em>monachus</em>. From this it has been conjectured that he was a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a> and not a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>; but this conclusion has been questioned by <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> writers such as Elmham in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> and <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> in later times. When <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> had decided the questions asked, St. Lawrence returned to Britain bearing the replies, and he remained with St. Augustine sharing his work. That saint, shortly before his death which probably took place in 604, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> St. Lawrence as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, lest the infant Church should be left for a time without a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. Of the new <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> episcopate <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> writes: "Lawrence, having attained the dignity of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, strove most vigorously to add to the foundations of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which he had seen so nobly laid and to forward the work by frequent words of holy exhortation and by the constant example of his devoted labour." The only extant genuine document relating to him is the fragment preserved by <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> of the letter he addressed to the Celtic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> exhorting them to peace and unity with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The death of King Ethelbert, in 616 was followed by a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> reaction under his son Eadbald, and under the sons of Sebert who became kings of the East Saxons. Saints <a href="../cathen/10168b.htm">Mellitus</a> and Justus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the newly-founded Sees of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and Rochester, took refuge with St. Lawrence at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and urged him to fly to Gaul with them. They departed, and he, discouraged by the undoing of St. Augustine's work, was preparing to follow them, when St. Peter appeared to him in a vision, blaming him for thinking of leaving his flock and inflicting stripes upon him. In the morning he hastened to the king, exhibiting his wounded body and relating his vision. This led to the conversion of the king, to the recall of Saints <a href="../cathen/10168b.htm">Mellitus</a> and Justus, and to their perseverance in their work of evangelizing Kent and the neighbouring provinces. These events occurred about 617 or 618, and shortly afterwards St. Lawrence died and was buried near St. Augustine in the north <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> of St. Peter's Abbey church, afterwards known as St. Augustine's. His festival is observed in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> on 3 February.
