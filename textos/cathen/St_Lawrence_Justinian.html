<h1>St. Lawrence Justinian</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> and first <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, b. in 1381, and d. 8 January, 1456. He was a descendant of the Giustiniani, a <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> patrician <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> which numbered several <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> among its members. Lawrence's <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> mother sowed the seeds of a devout <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> in the boy's youth. In 1400 when he was about nineteen years old, he entered the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular of St. Augustine</a> on the Island of Alga near <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. In spite of his youth he excited admiration by his poverty, <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortifications</a>, and fervour in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. At that time the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> was changed into a congregation of secular canons living in community. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> in 1406 Lawrence was chosen <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the community, and shortly after that general of the congregation. He gave them their constitution, and was so <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in spreading the same that he was looked upon as the founder. His <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for saintliness as well as his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> attracted the notice of <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> and on 12 May, 1433, he was raised to the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/03793c.htm">Castello</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> restored churches, established new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, aided the foundation of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and reformed the life of the canons. But above all he was noted for his <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">Christian charity</a> and his unbounded liberality. All the money he could raise he bestowed upon the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, while he himself led a life of simplicity and poverty. He was greatly respected both in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and elsewhere by the dignitaries of both <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. He tried to foster the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> by his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> as well as by his writings. The <a href="../cathen/03793c.htm">Diocese of Castello</a> belonged to the Patriarchate of Grado. On 8 October, 1451, <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> united the <a href="../cathen/03793c.htm">See of Castello</a> with the Patriarchate of Grado, and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of the patriarch was transferred to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and Lawrence was named the first <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and exercised his office till his death somewhat more than four years later. His <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> was ratified by <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> in 1524, and he was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1690 by <a href="../cathen/01295a.htm">Alexander VIII</a>. <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> appointed 5 September for the celebration of his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a>. The saint's <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> writings have often been published, first in <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a> in 1506, later in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1524, and in Basle in 1560, etc. We are indebted to his nephew, Bernardo Giustiniani, for his biography.
