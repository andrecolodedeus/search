<h1>St. Lawrence O'Toole</h1>  

<p>(L<font size=-2>ORCAN UA</font> T<font size=-2>UATHAIL</font>; <em>also spelled</em> Laurence O'Toole)

<p><a href="../cathen/04215a.htm">Confessor</a>, born about 1128, in the present County Kildare; died 14 November, 1180, at Eu in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>; <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1225 by <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>.

<p>His father was chief of Hy Murray, and his mother one of the Clan O'Byrne. At the age of ten he was taken as a hostage by Dermot McMurrogh, King of Leinster. In 1140 the boy obtained permission to enter the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/06582b.htm">Glendalough</a>; in that valley-sanctuary he studied for thirteen years, conspicuous for his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and learning. So great was his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> in the eyes of the community that on the death of Abbot Dunlaing, early in 1154, he was unanimously called to preside over the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/04092c.htm">St. Kevin</a>. Dermot, King of Leinster, married Mor, sister of <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>, and, though his character has been <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in dark colours by the native <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalists</a>, he was a great friend to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He founded an Austin <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a>, of the reform of Aroaise, in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, with two dependent cells at Kilculliheen (County Kilkenny) and at Aghade (County Carlow), in 1151. He also founded an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> for <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> at Baltinglass, and an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> for <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Austin canons</a> at <a href="../cathen/06045a.htm">Ferns</a>.

<p>St. Lawrence, through <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, declined the See of Glendalough in 1160, but on the death of Gregory, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> (8 October, 1161), he was chosen to the vacant see, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in Christ Church <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> by Gilla Isu (Gelasius), <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Armagh, early in the following year. This appointment of a native-born Irishman and his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> by the successor of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> marks the passing of Scandinavian supremacy in the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> capital, and the emancipation from canonical obedience to Canterbury which had obtained under the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> soon set himself to effect numerous reforms, commencing by converting the secular canons of Christ Church <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> into Aroasian canons (1163). Three years later he subscribed to the foundation charter of All Hallows <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a>, Dublin (founded by King Dermot), for the same order of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Austin canons</a>. Not content with the strictest observance of rules, he wore a <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">hair shirt</a> underneath his episcopal dress, and practised the greatest austerity, retiring for an annual retreat of forty days to <a href="../cathen/04092c.htm">St. Kevin's</a> cave, near Glendalough. At the second siege of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> (1170) <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> was active in ministration, and he showed his political foresight by paying due deference to <a href="../cathen/07220b.htm">Henry II</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, during that monarch's stay in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. In April, 1178, he entertained the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, Cardinal Vivian, who presided at the Synod of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. He successfully negotiated the Treaty of Windsor, and secured good terms for Roderic, King of Connacht. He attended the Lateran Council in 1179, and returned as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> for <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> was not long in Dublin till he deemed it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> again to visit <a href="../cathen/07220b.htm">King Henry II</a> (impelled by a burning charity in the cause of King Roderic), and he crossed to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in September of that year. After three weeks of detention at <a href="../cathen/01043c.htm">Abingdon Abbey</a>, <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> followed the English King to Normandy. Taken ill at the Augustinian Abbey of Eu, he was tended by Abbot Osbert and the canons of St. Victor; before he breathed his last he had the consolation of learning that <a href="../cathen/07220b.htm">King Henry</a> had acceded to his request.
