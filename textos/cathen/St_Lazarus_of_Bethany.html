<h1>St. Lazarus of Bethany</h1>  

<p>Reputed first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, died in the second half of the first century.

<p>According to a tradition, or rather a series of traditions combined at different epochs, the members of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> at <a href="../cathen/02531a.htm">Bethany</a>, the friends of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, together with some <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and others of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, were put out to sea by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> hostile to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in a vessel without sails, oars, or helm, and after a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> voyage landed in Provence at a place called today the Saintes-Maries. It is related that they separated there to go and preach the Gospel in different parts of the southeast of Gaul. <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a>, of whom alone we have to treat here, went to <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, and, having <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> a number of its inhabitants to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, became their first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. During the first <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> under <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> he hid himself in a <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a>, over which the celebrated <a href="../cathen/13388a.htm">Abbey of St.-Victor</a> was constructed in the fifth century. In this same <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> he was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a>, when he shed his blood for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. During the new <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> he was cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and beheaded in a spot which is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be identical with a cave beneath the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> Saint-Lazare. His body was later translated to <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of that town. But the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> claim to be in possession of his head which they still venerate.

<p>Like the other legends concerning the saints of the Palestinian group, this tradition, which was <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> for several centuries and which still finds some advocates, has no solid foundation. It is in a writing, contained in an eleventh century <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, with some other documents relating to St. Magdalen of V&eacute;zelay, that we first read of <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> in connection with the voyage that brought <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Magdalen</a> to Gaul. Before the middle of the eleventh century there does not seem to be the slightest trace of the tradition according to which the Palestinian <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> came to Provence. At the beginning of the twelfth century, perhaps through a confusion of names, it was <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> at <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Lazarus was to be found in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to <a href="../cathen/10727b.htm">St. Nazarius</a>. A search was made and <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">remains</a> were discovered, which were solemnly translated and were considered to be those of him whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> raised from the dead, but it was not thought <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to inquire why they should be found in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>The question, however, deserved to be examined with care, seeing that, according to a tradition of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, the body of St. Lazarus had been brought to Constantinople, just as all the other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the Palestinian group were said to have died in the Orient, and to have been <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a>, translated, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> there. It is only in the thirteenth century that the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> had come to Gaul with his two sisters and had been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> spread in Provence. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that a letter is cited (its origin is uncertain), written in 1040 by <a href="../cathen/02429a.htm">Pope Benedict IX</a> on the occasion of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the new church of <a href="../cathen/13388a.htm">St.-Victor</a> in which <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> is mentioned. But in this text the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> speaks only of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Lazarus, merely calling him the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> who was raised again to <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>. He does not speak of him as having lived in Provence, or as having been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>.

<p>The most ancient Proven&ccedil;al text alluding to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a> of St. Lazarus is a passage in the "Otia imperialia" of <a href="../cathen/06536c.htm">Gervase of Tillbury</a> (1212). Thus the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in his Proven&ccedil;al apostolate is of very late <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, and its supporters must produce more ancient and reliable documentary evidence. In the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of <a href="../cathen/13388a.htm">St.-Victor</a> at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> an epitaph of the of the fifth century has been discovered, which informs us that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> named <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> there. In the opinion of the most competent arch&aelig;ologists, however, this personage is Lazarus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> about 407, and who, having had to abandon his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 411, passed some <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> in Palestine, whence he returned to end his days in <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>. It is more than likely that it is the name of this <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his return from Palestine, that gave rise to the legend of the coming of the <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Biblical Lazarus</a> to Provence, and his apostolate in the city of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>.
