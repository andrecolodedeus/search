<h1>St. Leander of Seville</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of that city, b. at Carthage about 534, of a Roman <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> established in that city; d. at <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, 13 March, 600 or 601. Some historians claim that his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> Severian was duke or governor of Carthage, but St. Isidore simply states that he was a citizen of that city. The <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> from Carthage about 554 and went to Seville. The eminent worth of the children of Severian would seem to indicate that they were reared in distinguished surroundings. Severian had three sons, Leander Isidore, and Fulgentius and one daughter, Florentina. St. Leander and St. Isidore both became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Seville; <a href="../cathen/06315a.htm">St. Fulgentius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Carthagena, and <a href="../cathen/06114b.htm">St. Florentina</a>, a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>, who directed forty <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and one thousand <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. It has been also believed, but wrongly, that Theodosia, another daughter of Severian, became the wife of the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> king, Leovigild. Leander became at first a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, and then in 579 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>. In the meantime be founded a celebrated <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, which soon became a centre of learning and <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. He assisted the Princess Ingunthis to convert her husband Hermenegild, the eldest son of Leovigild, and defended the convert against his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> cruel reprisals. In endeavoring to save his country fromn <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, Leander showed himself an <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and a far-sighted patriot. Exiled by Leovigild, he withdrew to Byzantium from 579 to 582. It is possible, but not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, that he sought to rouse the <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Emperor Tiberius</a> to take up arms against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> king: in any case the attempt was without result. He profited, however, by his stay at Byzantium to compose important works against <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, and there became acquainted with the future <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a>, then <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="../cathen/11603a.htm">Pelagius II</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine</a> court. A close friensdship thenceforth united the two men, and the correspondence of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> with St. Leander remains one of the latter's greatest titles to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. It is not known exactly when Leander returned from exile. Leovigild <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> his son Hermenegild in 585, and himself died in 589.

<p>In this decisive hour for the future of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, Leander did most to ensure the religious unity, the fervent <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the broad culture on which was based its later greatness. He had a share in the conversion of Reccared, and never ceased to exercise over him a deep and beneficial influence. At the Third Council of Toledo, where <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, Leander delivered the closing sermon. On his return from this council, Leander convened an important synod in his <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> city of Seville (Conc. Hisp., I), and never afterwards ceased his efforts to consolidate the work, in which his brother and successor St. Isidore was to follow him. Leander received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> in August, 599. There remain unfortunately of this writer, superior to his brother Isidore, only two works: <em>De institutione virginum et contemptu mundi</em>, a monastic rule composed for his sister, and <em>Homilia de triumpho ecclesi&aelig; ob conversionem Gothorum</em> (P.L., LXXII). St. Isidore wrote of his brother: "This man of suave eloquence and eminent talent shone as brightly by his virtues as by his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. By his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> the Gothic people have been converted from <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" (De script. eccles., xxviii).
