<h1>St. Leodegar</h1>  

<p>(LEGER)

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, b. about 615; d. a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> in 678, at Sarcing, Somme. His mother was called Sigrada, and his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> Bobilo. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> being of high rank, his early childhood was passed at the court of Clotaire II. He went later to <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, to study under the guidance of his uncle, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that town. Having given <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his learning and virtue, and feeling a liking for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> life, his uncle <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> him <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and associated him with himself in the government of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Shortly afterwards he became a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> approval withdrew to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Maxentius in 650. He was soon elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and signalized himself by reforming the community and introducing the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>. In 656 he was called to the court by the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowed</a> Queen Bathildis to assist in the government of the kingdom and in the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of her children. In reward for his services he was named to the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a> in 610. He again undertook the work of reform and held a council at <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a> in 661. It dealt a crushing blow to <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ism</a> and was the first to adopt the Creed of St. Athanasius. He made reforms among the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, and he impressed on all <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> the importance of preaching and of administering the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, especially <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. For this purpose the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had three <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptisteries</a> erected in the town. The church of Saint-Nazaire was enlarged and embellished, and a refuge established for the indigent. Leodegar also caused the public buildings to be repaired and the old Roman walls to be restored. The latter still exist and are among the finest specimens preserved.

<p>Serious trouble soon arose in the state. The Austrasians demanded a king and young Childeric II was sent to them through the influence of Ebroin, the mayor of the palace in Neustria. The latter was practically a ruler and desired to get rid of all who thwarted his plans. The queen withdrew from the court to an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> she had founded at Chelles, near <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. On the death of Clotaire III, in 670, Ebroin raised Thierry to the throne, but Leodegar and the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> supported the claims of his elder brother Childeric, who, by the help of the Austrasians and <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundians</a>, was eventually made king. Ebroin was exiled to Luxeuil and Thierry sent to St. Denis. Leodegar remained at court, guiding the young king. When the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> protested against the marriage of Childeric and his first cousin, he also was sent to Luxeuil, his enemies representing him to the king as a conspirator. Childeric II was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> at Bondi in 673, by a <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frank</a> whom he had maltreated. Thierry III now ascended the throne in Neustria, making Leudesius his mayor. Leodegar and Ebroin hastened from Luxeuil to the court. In a short time Ebroin caused Leudesius to be <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> and became mayor. He vowed vengeance on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, whom he looked on as the cause of his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. About 675 the Duke of Champagne and the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a> and <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a> stirred up by Ebroin, attacked Autun. To save the town, Leodegar surrendered to them. He was brutally treated and his eyes put out, the sockets being seared with red-hot irons. Ebroin's bloodthirsty <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instincts</a> were not yet satiated; he caused the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> lips to be cut off and his tongue to be torn out. Some years later he persuaded the king that Childeric had been assassinated at the instigation of Leodegar. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was seized again, and, after a mock trial, was degraded and condemned. He was led out into a forest by Ebroin's order and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a>. His testament drawn up at the time of the council as well as the Acts of the council, are preserved. A letter which he caused to be sent to his unit her after his mutilation is likewise extant. His <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, which had been at Sarcing in Artois, were translated to the Abbey of St. Maxentius at <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> in 782. Later they were removed to <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Rennes</a> and thence to Ebreuil, which place took the name of Saint-L&eacute;ger. Some of them are still kept in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a> and the Grand S&eacute;minaire of <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>. In 1458 Cardinal Rolin caused his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a> to be observed as a holiday of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>.
