<h1>St. Leonard of Limousin</h1>  

<p>Nothing absolutely certain is known of his history, as his earliest "Life", written in the eleventh century, has no historical value whatever. According to this extraordinary legend, Leonard belonged to a noble <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the time of <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">King Clovis</a>, and St. Remy of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> was his godfather. After having secured from the king the release of a great number of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>, and refused episcopal honours which <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a> offered him, he entered a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Micy near Orl&eacute;ans. Later he went to Aquitaine and there preached the Gospel. Having obtained, through <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, a safe delivery for the Queen of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> in her confinement, he received as a gift from the king a domain at Noblac, near <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>, where he founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The veneration of this saint is as widely known as his history is obscure and uncertain. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that there is no trace of it before the eleventh century, but from that time it spread everywhere, and little by little churches were dedicated to him, not only in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but in all Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, especially in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, more particularly in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and also in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and other countries. Pilgrims, among them kings, princes, and high dignitaries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, flocked to Noblac (now St. Leonard). Numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are attributed to him, and in one small town alone, Inchenhofen, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, from the fourteenth to the eighteenth century, there are records of about 4000 favours granted through his intercession. The saint wrought the delivery of captives, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in confinement, those <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">possessed of an evil spirit</a>, people and beasts afflicted with diseases. At the end of the eleventh century his name had already become renowned among the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a> captured by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>. He is generally represented holding chains in his hands. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a> is celebrated on 6 November.
