<h1>St. Lorenzo da Brindisi</h1>  

<p>(Also: Lawrence, or Laurence, of Brindisi.)

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/02787e.htm">Brindisi</a> in 1559; died at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> on 22 July, 1619. In <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> he received the names of Julius Caesar. Guglielmo de Rossi &#151; or Guglielmo Russi, according to a contemporary writer &#151; was his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> name; his mother was Elisabetta Masella. Both were excellent <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Of a precocious <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, Lorenzo gave early evidence of a <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">religious vocation</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a> of <a href="../cathen/02787e.htm">Brindisi</a> were entrusted with his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. His progress in his studies was very rapid, and, when barely six, he had already given indication of his future success in oratory. Consequently, he was always the one chosen to address, in accordance with the Italian custom, a short sermon to his compatriots on the Infant <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> during the <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> festivities. When he was twelve years of age his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> died. He then pursued his studies at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> of St. Mark's and under the supervision of one of his uncles. In 1575 he was received into the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Order of Capuchins</a> under the name of Brother Lorenzo, and, after his profession, made his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at the <a href="../cathen/11387a.htm">University of Padua</a>. Owing to his wonderful memory he mastered not only the principal <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> languages, but also most of the <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> tongues. It was said he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the entire original text of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. Such a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, in the eyes of many, could be accounted for only by <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> assistance, and, during the process of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a>, the examiners of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> writings rendered the following judgment: "Vere inter sanctos Ecclesiae doctores adnumerari potest."

<p>Such unusual talents, added to a rare virtue, fitted Brother Lorenzo for the most diverse missions. When still a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> he preached the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> sermons in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and his success was so great that he was called successively to all the principal cities of the peninsula. Subsequently, thanks to his numerous journeys, he was enabled to evangelize at different periods most of the countries of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The sermons he left fill no less than eight folio volumes. He adopted the method of preaching in favour with the great <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> missionaries, or rather with apostolic workers of all times, who, aiming primarily to reach men's hearts and convert them, always adapt their style of discourse to the spiritual needs of their hearers. Brother Lorenzo held successively all the offices of his order. From 1596 to 1602 he had, as <a href="../cathen/04677a.htm">general definitor</a>, to fix his residence in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> assigned him the task of instructing the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; thanks to his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Hebrew and his powerful reasoning, he brought a great number of them to recognize the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. His saintliness, combined with his great kindliness, completed the preparing of the way for the grace of conversion. His success in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be called to several other cities, where he also <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> numerous <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. At the same time he was commissioned to establish houses of his order in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Amid the great difficulties created by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> he founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, and Graz, the nuclei of three provinces. At the chapter of 1602 he was elected <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. (At that time the Order of <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, which had broken away from the Observants in 1528 and had an independent constitution, gave its first superior the title of <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> only. It was not until 1618 that <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Pope Paul V</a> changed it to that of minister general). The very year of his election the new superior began the <a href="../cathen/15479a.htm">visitation</a> of the provinces. <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, Paris, <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, received him in turn. As his coming was preceded by a great <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, the people flocked to hear him preach and to receive his blessing. His administration characterized by wise firmness and fatherly tenderness, was of great benefit to the order. At the Chapter of 1605 he refused to undertake for a second term the government of his brethren, but until his death he was the best adviser of his successors.

<p>It was on the occasion of the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Prague (1601) that St. Lorenzo was named <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of the Imperial army, then about to march against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. The victory of <a href="../cathen/09181b.htm">Lepanto</a> (1571) had only temporarily checked the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> invasion, and several battles were still <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to secure the final triumph of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> armies. Mohammed III had, since his accession (1595), conquered a large part of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. The emperor, determined to prevent a further advance, sent Lorenzo of Brindisi as deputy to the German princes to obtain their cooperation. They responded to his appeal, and moreover the Duke of Merc&oelig;ur, Governor of Brittany, joined the imperial army, of which he received the effective command. The attack on Albe-Royal (now Stulweissenburg) was then contemplated. To pit 18,000 men against 80,000 <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> was a daring undertaking and the generals, hesitating to attempt it, appealed to Lorenzo for advice. Holding himself responsible for victory, he communicated to the entire army in a glowing speech the ardour and confidence with which he was himself animated. As his feebleness prevented him from marching, he mounted on horseback and, crucifix in hand, took the lead of the army, which he drew irresistibly after him. Three other <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> were also in the ranks of the army. Although the most exposed to danger, Lorenzo was not wounded, which was universally regarded as due to a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> protection. The city was finally taken, and the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> lost 30,000 men. As however they still exceeded in numbers the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> army, they formed their lines anew, and a few days later another battle was fought. It always the <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> who was at the head of the army. "Forward!" he cried, showing them the crucifix, "Victory is ours." The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> were again defeated, and the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of this double victory was attributed by the general and the entire army to Lorenzo.

<p>Having resigned his office of <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> in 1605, he was sent by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to evangelize <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. He here confirmed the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, brought back a great number to the practice of virtue, and converted many <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. In controversies his vast learning always gave him the advantage, and, once he had won the minds of his hearers, his saintliness and numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> completed their conversion. To protect the Faith more efficaciously in their states, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> princes of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> formed the alliance called the "Catholic League". Emperor Rudolph sent Lorenzo to Philip III of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> to persuade him to join the League. Having discharged this mission successfully, the saintly ambassador received a double mandate by virtue of which he was to represent the interests of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> at the court of Maximilian of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, head of the League. He was thus, much against his wishes, compelled to settle in <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> near Maximilian. Besides being <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> and ambassador, Lorenzo was also commissary general of his order for the provinces of Tyrol and <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> army. He was also chosen as arbitrator in the dispute which arose between the princes, and it was in fulfillment of this role that, at the request of the emperor, he restored harmony between the Duke of <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a> and a German nobleman. In addition to all these occupations he undertook, with the assistance of several <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, a missionary campaign throughout <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and for eight months travelled in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, and the Palatinate.

<p>Amid so many various undertakings Lorenzo found time for the practices of personal sanctification. And it is perhaps the greatest marvel of his life to have combined with <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> so manifold an unusually intense inner life. In the practice of the religious virtues St. Lorenzo equals the greatest <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. He had to a high degree the gift of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, and very rarely celebrated Holy Mass without falling into <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasies</a>. After the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>, his great devotion was the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> and the Office of the Blessed Virgin. As in the case of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>, there was something poetical about his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, which often burst forth into canticles to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>. It was in Mary's name that he worked his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and his favourite blessing was: "Nos cum prole pia benedicat Virgo Maria." Having withdrawn to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/03399a.htm">Caserta</a> in 1618, Lorenzo was hoping to enjoy a few days of seclusion, when he was requested by the leading men of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> to go to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and apprise Philip III of the conduct of Viceroy Ossuna. In spite of many obstacles raised by the latter, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> sailed from <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> and carried out his mission successfully. But the fatigues of the journey exhausted his feeble strength. He was unable to travel homeward, and after a few days of great suffering died at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> in the native land of St. Anthony (22 July, 1619), as he had predicted when he set out on his journey. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the cemetery of the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a> of Villafranca.

<p>The process of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a>, several times interrupted by various circumstances, was concluded in 1783. The <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> took place on 8 December, 1881. With St. Anthony, <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Blessed John Duns Scotus</a>, he is a Doctor of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>.

<p>The known writings of St. Lorenzo of Brindisi comprise eight volumes of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a>, two didactic treatises on oratory, a commentary on Genesis, another on Ezechiel, and three volumes of religious polemics. Most of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> are written in Italian, the other works being in Latin. The three volumes of controversies have notes in Greek and Hebrew. 

<p class="stiki"><em>Note:</em> In 1959 Pope John XXIII proclaimed St. Lorenzo da Brindisi a <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctor of the Universal Church</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 6 July.</p>
