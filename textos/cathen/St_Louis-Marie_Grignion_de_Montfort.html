<h1>St. Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort</h1>  

<p>Missionary in Brittany and Vendee; born at Montfort, 31 January, 1673; died at Saint Laurent sur Sevre, 28 April, 1716.

<p>From his childhood, he was indefatigably devoted to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> before the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, and, when from his twelfth year he was sent as a day pupil to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> college at <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Rennes</a>, he never failed to <a href="../cathen/15483b.htm">visit the church</a> before and after class. He joined a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of young men who during <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">holidays</a> <a href="../cathen/12236a.htm">ministered to the poor</a> and to the incurables in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and read for them edifying books during their meals. At the age of nineteen, he went on foot to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to follow the course in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, gave away on the journey all his money to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, exchanged clothing with them, and made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to subsist thenceforth only on <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at the age of twenty-seven, and for some time fulfilled the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> in a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. In 1705, when he was thirty-two, he found his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">vocation</a>, and thereafter devoted himself to preaching to the people. During seventeen years he preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> in countless towns and villages. As an orator he was highly <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifted</a>, his language being simple but replete with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">fire</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">divine love</a>. His whole life was conspicuous for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> difficult for modern degeneracy to comprehend: constant <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> carried to an unheard-of degree, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in humiliations and persecutions.

<p>The following two instances will illustrate his success. He once gave a <a href="../cathen/10391a.htm">mission</a> for the soldiers of the garrison at <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a>, and moved by his words, the men wept, and cried aloud for the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">forgiveness</a> of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> which terminated this <a href="../cathen/10391a.htm">mission</a>, an officer walked at the head, barefooted and carrying a banner, and the soldiers, also barefooted, followed, carrying in one hand a <a href="../cathen/04533a.htm">crucifix</a>, in the other a <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">rosary</a>, and singing <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>.

<p>Grignion's extraordinary influence was especially apparent in the matter of the calvary at Pontchateau. When he announced his determination of building a monumental calvary on a neighbouring hill, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was enthusiastically received by the inhabitants. For fifteen months between two and four hundred peasants worked daily without recompense, and the task had just been completed, when the king commanded that the whole should be demolished, and the land restored to its former condition. The <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> had convinced the Governor of Brittany that a fortress capable of affording aid to persons in revolt was being erected, and for several months five hundred peasants, watched by a company of soldiers, were compelled to carry out the work of destruction. Father de Montfort was not disturbed on receiving this humiliating news, exclaiming only: "Blessed be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>!"

<p>This was by no means the only trial to which Grignion was subjected. It often happened that the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, irritated by his success, secure by their intrigues his banishment form the district, in which he was giving a <a href="../cathen/10391a.htm">mission</a>. At <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a> some wretches put poison into his cup of broth, and, despite the antidote which he swallowed, his health was always impaired. On another occasion, some malefactors hid in a narrow street with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">assassinating</a> him, but he had a <a href="../cathen/14475a.htm">presentiment</a> of danger and escaped by going by another street. A year before his death, Father de Montfort founded two congregations &#151; the <a href="../cathen/15668a.htm">Sisters of Wisdom</a>, who were to devote themselves to <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> work and the instruction of <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> girls, and the <a href="../cathen/09749d.htm">Company of Mary</a>, composed of missionaries. He had long cherished these projects but circumstances had hindered their execution, and, humanly speaking, the work appeared to have failed at his death, since these congregations numbered respectively only four <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a> and two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> with a few brothers. But the blessed founder, who had on several occasions shown himself possessed of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, knew that the tree would grow. At the beginning of the twentieth century the <a href="../cathen/15668a.htm">Sisters of Wisdom</a> numbered five thousand, and were spread throughout every country; they possessed forty-four houses, and gave instruction to 60,000 children. After the death of its founder, the <a href="../cathen/09749d.htm">Company of Mary</a> was governed for 39 years by Father Mulot. He had at first refused to join de Montfort in his missionary labours. "I cannot become a missionary", said he, "for I have been paralysed on one side for years; I have an affection of the lungs which scarcely allows me to breathe, and am indeed so ill that I have no rest day or night." But the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man, impelled by a sudden inspiration, replied, "As soon as you begin to preach you will be completely cured." And the event justified the prediction. Grignion de Montfort was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in 1888.
