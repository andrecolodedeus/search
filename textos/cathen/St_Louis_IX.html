<div id="springfield2">
<h1>St. Louis IX</h1>  

<p>King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, son of Louis VIII and Blanche of Castile, born at Poissy, 25 April, 1215; died near <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a>, 25 August, 1270.

<p>He was eleven years of age when the death of Louis VIII made him king, and nineteen when he married Marguerite of Provence by whom he had eleven children. The regency of Blanche of Castile (1226-1234) was marked by the victorious struggle of the Crown against <a href="../cathen/12670b.htm">Raymond VII</a> in Languedoc, against Pierre Mauclerc in Brittany, against Philip Hurepel in the Ile de France, and by indecisive combats against Henry III of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In this period of disturbances the queen was powerfully supported by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> Frangipani. Accredited to Louis VIII by <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> as early as 1225, Frangipani won over to the French cause the sympathies of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, who was inclined to listen to Henry III, and through his intervention it was decreed that all the <a href="../cathen/03582b.htm">chapters</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> should pay to Blanche of Castile <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> for the southern <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>. It was the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> who received the submission of <a href="../cathen/12670b.htm">Raymond VII</a>, Count of Languedoc, at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in front of Notre-Dame, and this submission put an end to the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensian</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and prepared the union of the southern provinces to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (April 1229). The influence of Blanche de Castile over the government extended far beyond St. Louis's minority. Even later, in public business and when ambassadors were officially received, she appeared at his side. She died in 1253.

<p>In the first years of the king's personal government, the Crown had to combat a fresh rebellion against <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudalism</a>, led by the Count de la Marche, in league with Henry III. St. Louis's victory over this coalition at Taillebourg, 1242, was followed by the Peace of Bordeaux which annexed to the French realm a part of Saintonge.

<p>It was one of St. Louis's chief characteristics to carry on abreast his administration as national sovereign and the performance of his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> towards <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>; and taking advantage of the respite which the Peace of Bordeaux afforded, he turned his thoughts towards a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>. Stricken down with a fierce malady in 1244, he resolved to take the cross when news came that Turcomans had defeated the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a> and invaded <a href="../cathen/08361a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. (On the two <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a> of St. Louis [1248-1249 and 1270] see <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">C<font size=-2>RUSADES</font></a>.) Between the two <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a> he opened negotiations with Henry III, which he thought would prevent new conflicts between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The Treaty of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (28 May, 1258) which St. Louis concluded with the King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> after five years' parley, has been very much discussed. By this treaty St. Louis gave Henry III all the fiefs and domains belonging to the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>, <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11668a.htm">P&eacute;rigueux;</a> and in the event of Alphonsus of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> dying without issue, Saintonge and Agenais would escheat to Henry III. On the other hand Henry III renounced his claims to <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, Anjou, Touraine, <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a>, Poitou, and promised to do homage for the Duchy of Guyenne. It was generally considered and <a href="../cathen/08495b.htm">Joinville</a> voiced the opinion of the people, that St. Louis made too many territorial concessions to Henry III; and many historians held that if, on the contrary, St. Louis had carried the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Henry III further, the Hundred Years War would have been averted. But St. Louis considered that by making the Duchy of Guyenne a fief of the Crown of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> he was gaining a moral advantage; and it is an undoubted fact that the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, was as displeasing to the English as it was to the French. In 1263, St. Louis was chosen as arbitrator in a difference which separated Henry III and the English barons: by the Dit d'Amiens (24 January, 1264) he declared himself for Henry III against the barons, and annulled the Provisions of Oxford, by which the barons had attempted to restrict the authority of the king. It was also in the period between the two <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a> that St. Louis, by the Treaty of Corbeil, imposed upon the King of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> the abandonment of his claims to all the fiefs in Languedoc excepting Montpellier, and the surrender of his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to Provence (11 May, 1258). Treaties and arbitrations prove St. Louis to have been above all a lover of peace, a king who desired not only to put an end to conflicts, but also to remove the causes for fresh <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, and this spirit of peace rested upon the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> conception.

<p>St. Louis's relations with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Court have excited widely divergent interpretations and opinions. However, all historians agree that St. Louis and the successive <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> united to protect the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> from the encroachments or molestations of the barons and royal officers. It is equally recognized that during the absence of St. Louis at the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, Blanche of Castile protected the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in 1251 from the plunder and ill-treatment of a mysterious old marauder called the "Hungarian Master" who was followed by a mob of armed men &mdash; called the "Pastoureaux." The "Hungarian Master" who was said to be in league with the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a> died in an engagement near Villaneuve and the entire band pursued in every direction was dispersed and annihilated.



<p>But did St. Louis take measures also to defend the independence of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> against the <a href="../cathen/11451b.htm">papacy</a>? A number of historians once claimed he did. They attributed to St. Louis a certain <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">"pragmatic sanction"</a> of March 1269, prohibiting irregular collations of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>, prohibiting <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdicting</a> the tributes which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Court received from the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The Gallicans of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries often made use of this measure against the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is that it was a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> fabricated in the fourteenth century by juris-consults desirous of giving to the <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a> of Charles VII a precedent worthy of respect. This so-called pragmatic of Louis IX is presented as a royal decree for the reformation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; never would St. Louis thus have taken upon himself the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to proceed authoritatively with this reformation. When in 1246, a great number of barons from the north and the west leagued against the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> whom they accused of amassing too great wealth and of encroaching upon their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> called upon Louis to dissolve this league; how the king acted in the matter is not definitely known. On 2 May, 1247, when the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a> and of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, despatched to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a remonstrance against his taxations, his preferment of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> in the distribution of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, against the conflicts between <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the ordinaries, Marshal Ferri Past&eacute; seconded their complaints in the name of St. Louis. Shortly after, these complaints were reiterated and detailed in a lengthy memorandum, the text of which has been preserved by <a href="../cathen/11499a.htm">Mathieu Paris</a>, the historian. It is not known whether St. Louis affixed his signature to it, but in any case, this document was simply a request asking for the suppression of the abuses, with no pretensions to laying down principles of public right, as was claimed by the <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a>.

<p>Documents prove that St. Louis did not lend an ear to the grievances of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> against the emissaries of <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> and <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a>; he even allowed <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a> to generalize a custom in 1265 according to which the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> the titularies of which died while sojourning in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, should be disposed of by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Docile to the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Lateran Council</a> (1215), according to which kings were not to tax the churches of their realm without authority from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, St. Louis claimed and obtained from successive <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, in view of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to levy quite heavy taxes from the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. It is again this fundamental <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, ever present in St. Louis's thoughts that prompted his attitude generally in the struggle between the empire and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. While the <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a> and the successive <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> sought and contended for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France's</a> support, St. Louis's attitude was at once decided and reserved. On the one hand he did not accept for his brother Robert of Artois, the imperial crown offered him by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> in 1240. In his correspondence with <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick</a> he continued to treat him as a sovereign, even after <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick</a> had been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and declared dispossessed of his realms by <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> at the <a href="../cathen/09476a.htm">Council of Lyons</a>, 17 July, 1245. But on the other hand, in 1251, the king compelled <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick</a> to release the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisans</a>, the emperor's auxiliaries, when on their way in a <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> fleet to attend a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1245, he conferred at length, at Cluny, with <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> who had taken refuge in Lyons in December, 1244, to escape the threats of the emperor, and it was at this meeting that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> for the marriage of Charles Anjou, brother of Louis IX, to <a href="../cathen/02375a.htm">Beatrix</a>, heiress of Proven&ccedil;e was granted and it was then that Louis IX and Blanche of Castile promised <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> their support. Finally, when in 1247 <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> took steps to capture <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, the measures Louis took to defend the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> were one of the reasons which caused the emperor to withdraw. St. Louis looked upon every act of hostility from either power as an obstacle to accomplishing the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>. In the quarrel over <a href="../cathen/08084c.htm">investitures</a>, the king kept on friendly terms with both, not allowing the emperor to harass the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and never exciting the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> against the emperor. In 1262 when <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban</a> offered St. Louis, the <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Kingdom of Sicily</a>, a fief of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, for one of his sons, St. Louis refused it, through consideration for the Swabian dynasty then reigning; but when Charles of Anjou accepted <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV's</a> offer and went to conquer the <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Kingdom of Sicily</a>, St. Louis allowed the bravest <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to join the expedition which destroyed the power of the Hohenstaufens in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. The king hoped, doubtless, that the possession of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> by Charles of Anjou would be advantageous to the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>.

<p>St. Louis led an exemplary life, bearing constantly in mind his mother's words: "I would rather see you dead at my feet than guilty of a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." His biographers have told us of the long hours he spent in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>, without the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of his subjects. The French king was a great lover of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. French fancy still pictures him delivering judgements under the oak of Vincennes. It was during his reign that the "court of the king" (<em>curia regis</em>) was organized into a regular court of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, having competent experts, and judicial commissions acting at regular periods. These commissions were called parlements and the history of the "Dit d'Amiens" proves that entire <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> willingly looked upon him as an international judiciary. It is an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, however, to represent him as a great legislator; the document known as "Etablissements de St. Louis" was not a code drawn up by order of the king, but merely a collection of customs, written out before 1273 by a jurist who set forth in this book the customs of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, Anjou, and Maine, to which he added a few ordinances of St. Louis.

<p>St. Louis was a patron of <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architecture</a>. The Sainte Chappelle, an <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> gem, was constructed in his reign, and it was under his patronage that Robert of Sorbonne founded the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">"Coll&egrave;ge de la Sorbonne,"</a> which became the seat of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>.

<p>He was renowned for his <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charity</a>. The peace and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> of the realm come to us through the poor he would say. Beggars were fed from his table, he ate their leavings, washed their feet, ministered to the wants of the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, and daily fed over one hundred poor. He founded many <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and houses: the House of the Felles-Dieu for reformed prostitutes; the Quinze-Vingt for 300 blind men (1254), <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> at Pontoise, Vernon, Compi&eacute;gne.

<p>The <em>Enseignements</em> (written instructions) which he left to his son Philip and to his daughter Isabel, the discourses preserved by the witnesses at judicial investigations preparatory to his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> and <a href="../cathen/08495b.htm">Joinville's</a> anecdotes show St. Louis to have been a man of sound common sense, possessing indefatigable energy, graciously kind and of playful humour, and constantly guarding against the temptation to be imperious. The caricature made of him by the envoy of the Count of Gueldre: "worthless devotee, <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocritical</a> king" was very far from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. On the contrary, St. Louis, through his personal qualities as well as his saintliness, increased for many centuries the prestige of the French monarchy (see <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">F<font size=-2>RANCE</font></a>). St. Louis's <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> was proclaimed at <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a> in 1297, by <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>. Of the inquiries in view of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>, carried on from 1273 till 1297, we have only fragmentary reports published by Delaborde ("M&eacute;moires de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; de l'histoire de Paris et de l'Ilea de France," XXIII, 1896) and a series of extracts compiled by Guillaume de St. Pathus, Queen Marguerite's confessor, under the title of "Vie Monseigneur Saint Loys" (Paris, 1899).
