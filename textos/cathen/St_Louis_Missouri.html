<h1>St. Louis (Missouri)</h1>  

<p>(SANCTI LUDOVICI)

<p>Created a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> 2 July, 1826; raised to the rank of an archdiocese 20 July, 1847. It comprises that portion of the <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">State of Missouri</a> bounded on the north by the northern lines of the Counties of Pike, Audrain, Boone, and Howard, on the west by the western lines of the Counties Howard, Boone, Cole, Maries, Phelps, <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a> and Howell, on the south by the <a href="../cathen/01724a.htm">State of Arkansas</a>, and on the east by the Mississippi River, a territory of 26,235 square miles.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>The City of St. Louis was founded in 1764 by Pierre Liguest Lacl&egrave;de, a French nobleman, who came to Louisiana in 1755 and entered commercial life in <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>. In 1762 the firm of Maxent, Lacl&egrave;de and Co. were given the exclusive privilege of treating with the Indians of the North-west, and in the same year Monsieur Lacl&egrave;de with some companions came p to Fort Chartres in the interest of the firm. The Treaty of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1763 put an end to the privilege, and Monsieur Lacl&egrave;de purchased the interest of his partners, left Fort Chartres and landed on the west bank of the Mississippi, where in 1764 he selected a spot, at that time a wilderness, and here laid the foundation of St. Louis. He built the first house, employing Indian <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children in digging out the cellar and carrying the earth away in their blankets. By the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> ceded to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> all of <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a> west of the Mississippi, but there was no formal occupation by the Spanish until 1770. St. Louis therefore during the first years of its existence belonged to the Diocese of Santiago de Cuba, a <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> that extended throughout Louisiana. There were but two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the St. Louis territory: Father Luke Collet, a Recollect, and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> Meurin; the former died in 1765 leaving but one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the Mississippi Valley, the veteran Father Sebastian Louis Meurin. The story of good old Father Meurin is replete with tales of hardship and sacrifice made for the French and Indians of Illinois and Missouri. In 1766, finding the task too great, he wrote the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec: "Ste Genevi&egrave;ve is my residence. Thence I go every spring and visit the other villages. I return again in the autumn and whenever I am summoned on sick calls. I am only sixty-one years old, but I am exhausted, broken by twenty-five years of mission work in this county and of these nearly twenty years of malady and disease show me the gates of death. I am incapable, therefore, of long application or bodily fatigue. I cannot accordingly supply the spiritual necessities of the country, where even the stoutest men could not endure. It would need four <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. If you can give me only one, he should be appointed to Cahokia, and with the powers of <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>." In 1768 Fr. P. Gibault, Vicar General of Quebec, was sent to his aid and laboured with him until the formal occupation of <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>.

<p>Father Gibault continued his visits until the coming of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin Fathers</a> from <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> in 1772, and Father Meurin remained on the east side of the Mississippi River. Prior to Father Gibault's coming, there was no church building in this territory. The records at Cahokia show that at St. Louis Father Meurin in 1766 <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, under condition, in a tent for want of a church, Marie, lawful daughter of John Baptiste Deschamp and of Marie Pion; and again, that he conferred the same sacrament upon Antoine, son of Lisette, a Pawnee slave, on 9 May of the same. year, Father Gibault, soon after his arrival, undertook the erection of a small church built of upright logs. This modest edifice was rapidly completed and dedicated on 24 June, 1770. With the advent of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> in 1772, Father Valentine of that order became the flat resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of St. Louis and remained until 1776. He was succeeded by Father Bernard, also a <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a>, who remained for thirteen years and during his stay organized St. Charles and St. Ferdinand. From 1789 to 1793 there are no records to show that St. Louis had a resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. In 1793 Pierre Joseph Didier, a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, assumed charge and remained until 1799. In 1800 the territory of <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a> was receded to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and three years later transferred by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Thus we find that St. Louis and the Louisian territory during its early days was subject to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of: the Vicariate Apostolic of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, 1658-1674; the Diocese of Quebec, 1674-1759; the Diocese of Santiago in <a href="../cathen/04558c.htm">Cuba</a>, 1759-1787; the <a href="../cathen/07153b.htm">Diocese of Havana</a>, 1787-11793; the <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Diocese of Louisiana</a> and the Floridas, 1793-1826. The territory east of the Mississippi was subject to: the Vicariate Apostolic of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, 1658-1674; the Diocese of Quebec, 1674-1784; the Prefecture Apostolic of the thirteen states of the Union, 1784-1789; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 1789-1808; the Diocese of Bardstown, 1808-1834.

<p>In 1800 Rev. Thomas Flynn was made <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of St. Louis, remaining in that position until 1808 when he removed to Ste Genevi&egrave;ve. Again from 1808 until 1811, when Father Savigne took charge, we find the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> without the service of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Father Savigne's ministry extended over a period of six years, and during these years the city grew to such an extent as to require the labours of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who could devote to it his entire time and attention. In 1810 the population numbered 1400 &mdash; mostly French with some <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> and a constantly increasing influx of Americans. Thus far St. Louis had been but a struggling village, the surrounding country but a wilderness that re-echoed to the warwhoop of the savage or resounded with the crack of the ranger's rifle. Now things were to assume a more important aspect, so that five years later we hear of the Diocese of St. Louis. St. Louis as a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> had its origin amidst the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> troubles and disputes of the <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Diocese of Louisiana</a> and the Floridas. The Diocese of St. Christopher of <a href="../cathen/07153b.htm">Havana</a>, <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, and the Floridas was erected in 1787, and Rt. Rev. Joseph de Trespalatios was appointed the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; thus St. Louis was under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07153b.htm">Havana</a>. On 25 April, 1793, the <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Diocese of Louisiana</a> and both Floridas was created; <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> was designated as the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> city, and the Rev. Louis Pe&ntilde;alver y Cardenas was appointed the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He arrived at <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> on 17 July, 1795. On 24 Sept., 1815, Rt. Rev. Louis William Du Bourg was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a> and the Floridas, and immediately after proposed the erection of the See of St. Louis then in Upper Louisiana (sometimes called Louisiana Superior, sometimes "Alta Louisiana"). Very soon after, however, he requested the withdrawal of this proposal owing to the serious and complicated troubles caused by the trustees (Marguilliers and three misguided <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> in <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>).



<p>Open menaces of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and other serious threats prompted him to solicit the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> to permit him to take up his residence at St. Louis and to continue St. Louis as part of the Louisiana <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> granted the request, and on 5 Jan., 1818, he came to St. Louis accompanied by Bishop Flaget, of Bardstown, Ky. He was received here with Mat welcome, was installed with the usual solemnities by Bishop Flaget, and took possession of the pro-cathedral, a poor wooden structure in ruinous condition. The same year he founded at St. Louis a Latin Academy which later developed into the University of St. Louis. On 13 Aug., 1822, the Very Rev. Joseph Rosati, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> for Bishop Du Bourg, was appointed by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tenagre, and created <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the territories of <a href="../cathen/10394a.htm">Mississippi</a> and Alabama. This appointment Father Rosati declined, giving to the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> as reasons the paucity and penury of the people of <a href="../cathen/10394a.htm">Mississippi</a> and Alabama; the utter impossibility of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> being able to sustain himself at <a href="../cathen/10709b.htm">Natchez</a>; Bay St. Louis being too poor to erect even an unpretentious church building, and no other city in the two states being sufficiently well-equipped with church or resources worthy of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He also emphasized the importance of his continuing as president of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, as no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was at hand equal to the task of assuming its direction. His arguments and the protests of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> prevailed. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Quum superiori anno" <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 14 July, 1823, addressed to Bishop Du Bourg, revoked the appointment and suppressed the vicariate. Father Rosati, however, was not to escape episcopal honours. He was appointed coadjutor to Bishop Du Bourg by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Apostolic Brief</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 22 June, 1823, and by instructions of said <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> was to reside in St. Louis. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> recited that after three years the <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Diocese of Louisiana</a> was to be divided, <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> and St. Louis to be named <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a>, Bishop Du Bourg to have his choice of either, and Bishop Rosati preside over the destinies of the other. Father Rosati received these documents on 4 Dec., 1823, and letters from the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> told him that he must submit to the dignity he had thus far sought to escape. Bishop Du Bourg was then in <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, and selected for the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> services the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Ascension in Donaldsonville, La., a central position, where many <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> might assemble. Here the Very Rev. Father Rosati was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tenagre on 25 March, 1824, by Bishop Louis-Guillaume-Vatentin Du Bourg, assisted by the Very Rev. Louis Sibourd, V.G., and the Rev. Anthony de Sedella, O.M. Cap., <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>.

<p>Not long after, Bishop Du Bourg found the task imposed upon him beyond his strength, and, discouraged by the difficulties which arose to thwart his projects and harassed by bitter opposition in his own city (which in some of his writings he styled "vera nova <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>"), he resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> and departed for <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in April, 1826. Pending this the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> had, on 26 June, 1826, voted the erection of S. Louis as a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which action was approved of by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on 2 July, of the same year. On the same day the resignation of Bishop Du Bourg was formally accepted, and letters were forwarded to Bishop Rosati, asking him to accept the vacant see. This he earnestly requested to be allowed to decline, pleading his lack of acquaintance with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people of <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a> and his familiarity with the districts of <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, and Arkansas. He urged the appointment of Rev. Leo de Neekere, a <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, and sought the intervention of Bishop Du Bourg to have this effected. His objection was sustained, and finally on 20 March, 1827, <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Pope Leo XII</a> transferred him from the See of Tenagre to that of St. Louis, and requested him to continue the administration of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> until such time as other provision might be made.

<p>At this period the <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Diocese of Louisiana</a> comprised, roughly speaking, the territory extending from the Gulf of Mexico to the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Dominion of Canada</a> and from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains. Owing to the existing indefinite lines of demarcation it was at times difficult and even impossible to decide with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> the exact confines of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The uncertainty of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, which necessarily arose from this, influenced <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to advise all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> to constitute their neighbouring <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> their vicars-general; so in the archives of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> we find documents appointing Bishop Rosati <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to the Bishops of Quebec, Bardstown, St. Boniface, <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> and <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">State of Illinois</a> was part of the Diocese 1808, yet Bishop Flaget in exercising his episcopal functions along the Mississippi in the <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">State of Illinois</a> ministered to the wants of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> on the western side of the river, and so also Bishop Du Bourg, when residing at St. Louis, gave his attention to the faithful in <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, and in this Bishop Rosati also followed the example set. However, in the year 1832, Bishop Rosati wrote to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> that as the western half of Illinois had hitherto been cared for by the <a href="../cathen/11284b.htm">ordinary</a> of St. Louis it would prove more expedient to attach it to the See of St. Louis not only <em>de facto </em>but also <em>de jure</em>. Pursuant to this suggestion <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, when erecting the See of Vincennes, in the year 1834, divided the <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">State of Illinois</a> and attached the western half to St. Louis and the eastern half to Vincennes; thus it remained until the year 1844 when the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> was established.

<p>The Diocese of St. Louis at the time of its erection, as is found in Bishop Rosati's report to the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1 Nov., 1825, comprised the northern portion of the so-called "Louisiana Purchase" including Arkansas. In Missouri Bishop Rosati mentions the city, St. Louis, where there was but a single <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and, as he says, need of at least two more. Here the church begun by Bishop Du Bourg was still unfinished. Financial depression having driven away some and prevented others from paying their subscriptions, suit was entered for payment of the church <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> and permission asked of the State to sell the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> house and other <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church properties</a> to meet the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. Thus the conditions prevalent were by no means encouraging; finally, in 1822, part of the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> was sold, including the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> residence, as also a building in course of construction for an academy. The purchaser gave Bishop Rosati a time in which to redeem it, and to secure <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> means he sent to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> Rev. Francis Neill, in the hope that generous <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> there would aid him in saving the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. In his report to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Bishop Rosati (besides St. Louis, which he styled the most important city of the State and one of great possibilities) mentions the following others: Carondelet, or Vide Poche, with a hundred very poor <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of French origin; Florissant, cared for by Father Van Quickenbom S.J., who was in charge of five scholastics, and at the same time directed a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for Indian boys; St. Charles, Portage des Sioux, Dardenne (now St. Peter's); C&ocirc;te sans Desain, a French village distant about ninety miles from St. Louis; La Mine di Plumb (Old Mines, with about 200 <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>; St. Michael's (Fredericktown); Ste Genevi&eacute;ve with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; the Barrens (French <em>Bois Brul&eacute;</em>, Latin <em>Sylva Cremata</em>), consisting then of about 200 <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> attended by one of the Fathers of St. Mary's Seminary, with 16 students of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in attendance. Here too was located the Loretto Convent with 17 sisters and some <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a>; though struggling with difficulties and lack of funds the sisters maintained a free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and cared for 24 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>. The last Louisiana town mentioned in the report was New Madrid, with 80 <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. In Illinois Bishop Rosati notes Kaskaskia with 150 <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, and Prairie du Rocher, with church and resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the Rev. Father Olivier, aged seventy-five years, who was almost blind and unable to render any services to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. "I have offered him a room in the seminary", writes the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, "he is a saint who has spent, himself for many years in the service of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> about these parts."

<p>Aside from this report we find, in other documents extant, mention made of Ap Creek (1816); Cape Girardeau (1816); Potosi (1816); Mine La Motte (1816); Harrisonville (1818); Osage Indian Nation Missions in Kansas (1822) with Rev. Ch. de La Croix as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. In 1818 Rev. Michael Portier was resident at Brazeau, Mo., and in 1822 Rev. Hercules Brassock at Drury, Ill., but as no mention of these names is found before or after this time we can only conclude that these fathers were residing with English-speaking <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> with the purpose probably of learning English. The report of Bishop Rosati was <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1825, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was established in 1826; yet the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and missions remain the same in 1826 as in 1825 and so continue until 1831. In 1827 we count 1 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 4 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 8 <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> fathers, 8 <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit fathers</a>; a total of 20 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. In 1831 there were 11 churches with and 8 churches without resident priests; 20 missions; 1 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; 16 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>; 8 <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> Fathers; 11 <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; a total of 35 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population numbered 8000. It should be noted that on 20 Aug., 1818, Ladies of the Society of the Sacred Heart, including <a href="../cathen/05182a.htm">Madame Philippina Duchesne</a>, <a href="../cathen/14336a.htm">Superior</a>, Octavia Berthold, and Eugenia Audet, with two lay sisters arrived in St. Louis and soon after located at St. Charles, Mo. In October of the same year the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> Fathers came from Bardstown, Ky., and settled permanently at the Barrens. On 31 May, 1823, two <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Fathers Charles van Quickenborn and Peter Timmermans, with seven scholastics and three <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, arrived, and soon after located in Florissant, Mo., while on the same day of the same year twelve Sisters of Loretto took up their permanent residence at the Barrens in Perry County. On 25 November, 1829, four Sisters of Charity arrived at St. Louis from Emmitsburg <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, and began their labours in conducting a Hospital, to found which <a href="../cathen/10626c.htm">Mr. John Mullanphy</a> had given houses and lots and other properties: On 30 May of the same year Bishop Rosati approved of the foundation of the Visitation Nuns at Kaskaskia, Ill.; these later, in 1844, settled at St. Louis, being compelled to leave Kaskaskia because of the great flood of that year. On 5 March, 1836, Rev. James Fontbonne arrived at St. Louis with seven <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> from the Diocese of Ly&oacute;ns, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Four <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> Nuns arrived on 4 Sept., 1848. The Rev. Joseph Paquin was the first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to own Missouri as his native state. He was born at New Madrid, 4 Dec., 1799. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of St. Louis by the Rt. Rev. Bishop Rosati was the Rt. Rev. Michael Portier, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Oliensis an <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Alabama and the two Floridas, the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> taking place 5 Nov., 1826.
<h3>Joseph Rosati</h3>

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/14148b.htm">Sora</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a> on 12 Jan., 1789, he resolved even in his early days to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> his life to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In his youth be entered the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Fathers of the Congregation of the Mission</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was there professed, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. No record of his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> is extant, due, no doubt, to the fact that <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> at the time held sway in the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a> and he commanded the expulsion and suppression of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> Fathers. It is evident, however, that it must have been either in 1811 or 1812, as documents show that on 19 Nov., 1812, the usual <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> faculties were given him by the Cardinal Vicar of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His first charge was as assistant to the <a href="../cathen/01470c.htm">Rev. Felix de Andreis, C.M.</a> This we find him occupying when in the year 1815 Bishop Du Bourg was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. A few days after his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> Bishop Du Bourg arranged with the cardinal prefect to have a colony of <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> Fathers go to America to found a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and take up missionary work in his new diocese. <a href="../cathen/01470c.htm">Rev. Felix de Andreis</a> was appointed superior of this band, and he selected as his associate the Rev. Joseph Rosati and the Rev. John B. Aquaroni. They, together with four <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> and two <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, the Revs. Joseph Carreti and Andrew Ferrari, and also four <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students, on 18 Oct., 1815, departed from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for their future field of labour. Bishop Du Bourg, detained at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on important and serious business, could not accompany them. He, therefore, before their departure, appointed <a href="../cathen/01470c.htm">Father de Andreis</a> his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and Father Rosati director of the seminarians, noting in the appointment of the latter that, should <a href="../cathen/01470c.htm">Rev. de Andreis</a> die, Father Rosati was to succeed him as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>.

<p>On 7 Jan., 1816, the colonists arrived at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, took up their residence in the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> palace and remained there several months, applying themselves to the study of the French and English languages. Finally, 12 June, 1816, they embarked at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> for Baltimore and landed there 27 July, 1816; thence they proceeded by stage to Pittsburg, and here were delayed several weeks because low water in the Ohio River, finally arriving at Bardstown during October of 1817. Bishop Flaget received them most cordially and with every mark of affection, and placed at their disposal part of his <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. Here they remained studying English under the tutorship of Bishop David, then coadjutor to Bishop Flaget. Father Rosati in a very short time had advanced sufficiently to be able to preach and hear <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a> in the English language, and aside from his occupation as professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, devoted himself to <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> work. When in June 1817, word was received that Bishop Du Bourg had sailed from <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> and would arrive at Annapolis about 14 September on his way to St. Louis, Bishop Flaget and Fathers <a href="../cathen/01470c.htm">de Andreis</a> and Rosati, with one <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a>, set out on horseback from Bardstown, Ky., to St. Louis, a distance of over three hundred miles, there to arrange a reception for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. After the installation of Bishop Du Bourg at St. Louis, Bishop Flaget and Father Rosati returned to Bardstown, leaving <a href="../cathen/01470c.htm">Father de Andreis</a> and Brother Blanca at Ste Genevi&egrave;ve, Mo. Father Rosati remained at Bardstown as <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> until October, 1818, when by order of Bishop Du Bourg the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was transferred to the Barrens, Perry County, Mo. Father Rosati was its first president and also <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the village church. On 15 Oct., 1820, the <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> <a href="../cathen/01470c.htm">de Andreis</a> died and was succeeded by Father Rosati as superior of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> Fathers and as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of Bishop Du Bourg. Admirably did he accomplish the work devolving on him by virtue of his new appointment. Soon, without any conscious effort, he found himself surrounded by a body of enthusiastic and willing colabourers, and his ability and scholarship were soon manifest throughout the land.

<p>In 1821 Bishop Du Bourg intended separating Mississippi and other territory from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and pleaded for the appointment of Father Rosati as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. This dignity of the latter's <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> prompted him to decline, but later on <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> nominated him <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tenagre, and coadjutor to Bishop Du Bourg. He was enjoined under obedience to accept the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a>, and he remained in this office until the establishment of the Diocese of St. Louis, when he was placed in charge of its destinies and entrusted with the administration of the See of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>. His worth as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can be gleaned from the results of his administration. Numerous <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders were introduced, and during his time and partly by his efforts, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> established their <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at Florissant, Mo., and founded the western province of the order. In 1827 Bishop Rosati transferred to them the College at St. Louis which has since grown into the present University of St. Louis. The Religious of the Sacred Heart, the Visitation Nuns, and the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> grew and developed by his advice and under his guidance. A home for the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, an institute for deaf-mutes and the St. Louis Mullanpby Hospital were made possible by his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and untiring efforts. In the year 1831 he began the building of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>, a beautiful, stately, and at the same time costly, structure, the cornerstone of which was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> blessed and laid by him on 1 Aug., 1831.

<p>The solemn <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> took place on 26 Oct., 1834, Bishop Rosati himself being the consecrator, assisted by Bishops Flaget of Bardstown, <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">Purcell</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, and Brut&eacute; of Vincennes in presence of many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and a great concourse of people. Here too, only two days later, he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> Bishop Brut&eacute;. Even today the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> stands, a monument of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and devotion of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of old St. Louis, the wonder and the admiration of all because of its purity of architecture and solidity of construction. In the midst of his distracting and arduous <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> Bishop Rosati yet found time for study and literary work. As a writer he was clear and convincing and many of the ablest and most learned documents of the Four Provincial Councils of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> are the results of his pen. He was a prudent, efficient administrator and an eloquent speaker, speaking equally well in Italian, French, and English. His audiences included men of every rank and station and so convincing were his words and so impressive his <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, that his converts during the year 1839 numbered 299. His confessional was always surrounded by penitents and in and out of the confessional he was accessible to all who sought his friendship or advice. He permitted himself to call no time his own, but at all hours was upon any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; thus be came to wield a might influence for good.

<p>On 25 April, 1840 the Fourth <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> and after its close departed for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was most graciously received by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a>. Appointed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a> to <a href="../cathen/07114a.htm">Hayti</a>, he was commissioned to adjust the relationship between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the Republic of <a href="../cathen/07114a.htm">Hayti</a>; he accepted the appointment. In doing so, however he did not fail to note the danger of leaving his far extended and yet undeveloped diocese during so long a time without a leader; consequently he so advised the appointment of a coadjutor. This <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> agreed to and asked him to name his choice, he thereupon proposed the name of the <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Very Rev. Peter Richard Kenrick</a>, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Rt. Rev. Francis Patrick Kenrick</a> of Philadelphia; at the same time he drew attention to the fact that only a short time before he had petitioned <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to appoint as his coadjutor the Very Rev. John Timon, C.M., and that Father Timon had declined the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. Now, he argued, in order to prevent a recurrence, of the same nature it might be well to <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">oblige</a> <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Father Kenrick</a> under obedience to accept the office. That <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> acted on the suggestion is clear from a letter of the <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Rt. Rev. Francis Patrick Kenrick</a>, dated Philadelphia, 4 June, 1841, addressed to Bishop Rosati in which we read: "the positive wishes of His Holiness have, I believe, secured my brother's full acquiescence". Before going to <a href="../cathen/07114a.htm">Hayti</a> Bishop Rosati returned to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, and on 30 Nov., 1841, at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> at Philadelphia, he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Rt. Rev. Peter Richard Kenrick</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Drass and coadjutor of the Diocese of St. Louis. Having arranged the affairs of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and informed himself as well as possible regarding matters at <a href="../cathen/07114a.htm">Hayti</a>, he set sail from New York, 15 Jan., 1942, and landed at Port au Prince on the twenty-ninth day of the same month, where he was received with every mark of respect. Success <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> his efforts in so far as he was able to convince the president of the advisability of signing a Concordat which should be submitted to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for approval.

<p>He left <a href="../cathen/07114a.htm">Hayti</a> 22 February, 1842, landed at Brest, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a>, and from there proceeded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to report the result of his endeavours to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The remainder of the year he spent in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. In the spring of 1843, the Concordat having been signed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he journeyed to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to arrange for his return trip to <a href="../cathen/07114a.htm">Hayti</a>. It is of interest to note that on his trip to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> he met and travelled with the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> to <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, the Most Rev. Vincenzo Gioacchino Pecci, titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04615b.htm">Damietta</a>, afterwards the illustrious <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, and that the latter in 1881, in speaking of this meeting, said that never during his days had he met with a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> so saintly (<em>nessuno si santo</em>) and so imbued with filial <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and respect for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. When Bishop Rosati reached <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> his health, long before undermined by the privations and exposures of his missionary life in the Far West, gave way; he was stricken with an acute attack of lung trouble, which he had contracted during the previous month of February, and, acting on the advice of his physicians, he returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he died in the House of the Congregation of the Fathers of the Mission on 25 Sept., 1843. Coming to Missouri in the primeval days of its settlement, when it had scarcely a vestige of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a>, he left the diocese in a flourishing and prosperous condition. Preparatory to the first Diocesan Synod of St. Louis, convoked by him, and opened 21 April, 1839, he issued a call for a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> census, the result of which shows: a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 31,503; 3 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the Ladies of the Sacred Heart, with 42 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> in charge of the Sisters of Charity (19 sisters); 4 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the Sisters of Loretto, with 30 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; 2 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, with 11 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; 1 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Visitation Nuns, with 19 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; 4 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminaries</a>, with 30 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>; 3 colleges; 7 <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>. In 1842 we find 39 churches with resident priests; 6 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; 36 churches without resident priests; 60 missions; 2 Bishops; 29 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>; 21 <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> Fathers; 28 <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; a total of 80 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population at this time is give as 100,000. Bishop Rosati died 25, Sept. 1843, and was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Peter Richard Kenrick</a>.
<h3>First archbishop, Peter Richard Kenrick (1841-1895)</h3>

<p>Some lives there are that mark an epoch &mdash; lives which by virtue of their striking power or unique position, or both, stand apart and form landmarks in history. Such was the life of <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Peter Richard Kenrick</a>, the Second Bishop and the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of the Diocese of St. Louis.

<p>On 20 July, 1847, St. Louis was raised to the rank of an archdiocese and <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Bishop Kenrick</a> became its first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. No suffragans, however, were assigned to him as at the time other <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal sees</a> were under contemplation in the territory. On 25 May, 1850, he issued a call for the Second Diocesan Synod and on the twenty-fifth of the following August, 43 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> assembled in council. This synod, which was the only one held during his life, passed regulations which obtained during his administration. He also presided at the two Provincial Councils convoked by him, the first 7 Sept., 1855, the second, 5 Sept., 1858; a third was called for May, 1861, but was postponed because of the impending Civil War. On 3 May, 1857, <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the Rt. Rev. James Duggan his coadjutor. One year later Bishop Duggan was transferred to the See of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>.

<p>In the spring of 1872 <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a> secured the appointment of the Very Rev. Patrick J. Ryan as his second coadjutor. The <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> services were held in St. Louis and Father Ryan, on 14 February, 1872, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15041b.htm">Tricomia</a> and coadjutor to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of St. Louis with the right of succession. Bishop Ryan remained coadjutor until 8 June, 1884, when he was promoted to the Archiepiscopal See of Philadelphia. After the departure of Archbishop Ryan, <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a> resumed, unaided, the administration of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In 1893, because of age and infirmities incidental thereto, he found it impossible to continue alone the administration and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> sent him as coadjutor with the right of succession, the Right Rev. John J. Kain, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15608a.htm">Wheeling</a>, W. Va. Three years later, on 3 March, 1896, <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a> died in the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> residence at St. Louis. He was a man of great learning, of modest, unassuming manner, never too reserved and never too familiar, in fact a spiritual man, a man of great <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to whom littleness and meanness were unknown. He seldom came forward except in defence of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests that were attacked, and then rather in writing than in public meetings. His main work lay hidden from the public eye; this work was to organize, consolidate, and expand his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; to foster the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> spirit among his priests; to counsel wisely and prudently his brother <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people of every rank and condition. For such work it was that he became so well-known and so highly esteemed, and that his name ranks so high in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> in America.

<p>During the life of <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a> the expansion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the Diocese of St. Louis was unprecedented. Prior to 1843 there were but three churches in the City of St. Louis: the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, SS. Mary's and Joseph's, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, and only 39 throughout the entire diocese. At the time of his death we find 58 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches in the City of St. Louis and 108 outside the city a 26 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and 97 mission churches, with a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of nearly 200,000. In 1849, he introduced the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>; in 1862, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Fathers; in 1866, the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist Fathers</a>; in 1869, the Alexian Brothers; in 1884, the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionist</a> Fathers; in 1848, the Sisters of the Good Shepherd; in 1849, the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> Nuns; in 1856, the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>; in 1858, the Notre Dame Sisters; in 1863, the Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> in 1869, the <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>; in 1872, the Sisters of St. Mary and the Sisters of St. Francis; in 1880, the Oblate Sisters of Providence, and in 1882, the Sisters of the Precious Blood. In 1843 he founded a monthly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> magazine, "The Catholic Cabinet and Chronicle of Religious Intelligence", in 1850 a weekly publication called "The Shepherd of the Valley", which was discontinued in 1854. To systematize <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a> he established in 1847 the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">St. Vincent de Paul Society</a>, which organization grew and expanded and still continues its noble work in aiding the destitute and distressed. In 1892 "The <a href="../cathen/16069a.htm">Queen's Daughters</a>" were organized, a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of ladies who devote their energies to forming sewing classes among the poorer people, teaching the scholars useful and beneficial arts, and providing clothing and other necessaries for the poor and deserving. <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a> furthermore organized the New Cathedral Board, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Orphan Board, the Calvary Cemetery Board, and the Diocesan Seminary Board, each of which he duly incorporated. He secured the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and building of the Visitation Nuns in the City of St. Louis for the new Kenrick Seminary and began the fund for the erection of a new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. During his episcopate sixteen new sees were formed and established out of the original Diocese of St. Louis: Little Rock, 1843; Santa F&eacute; and <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, 1850; Leavenworth, 1851; Alton and Omaha, 1857; Green Bay, <a href="../cathen/08735b.htm">La Crosse</a>, <a href="../cathen/13356b.htm">St. Joseph</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04733c.htm">Denver</a>, 1868; Kansas City, 1880; Davenport, 1881; Wichita, <a href="../cathen/04206a.htm">Concordia</a>, <a href="../cathen/03651a.htm">Cheyenne</a>, and Lincoln, 1887: At the time of his death in 1896 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> statistics show: city <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 61; <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> outside the City of St. Louis, 114; missions with churches, 94; stations, 40; <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> with attending <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, 27; <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, 2; <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 229; regulars, 121; total <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 350; <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, 200,000.
<h3>Second archbishop, John Joseph Kain (1895-1903)</h3>

<p>He was born at Martinsburg, Berkeley County, W. Va., 21 31 March, 1841. After attending the Martinsburg Academy, he entered St. Charles College at Ellicott City, Md., where he finished his Classical studies. He made his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at St. Mary's Seminary, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and was there <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on 2 July, 1866. His first appointment was as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Harper's Ferry, W. Va., and with it as a centre he ministered to the spiritual wants of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of eight counties. After nine years' pastorate, when only thirty-four years of age, he was selected by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to succeed Bishop Whelan of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15608a.htm">Wheeling</a>, W. Va. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/15608a.htm">Wheeling</a> 23 May, 1875. In 1893 <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> created him <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Oxyrynchia and coadjutor to <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a>, and on 31 Aug., of the same year, he came to St. Louis. He was appointed to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of the Diocese of St. Louis, 21 May, 1895. During his administration he manifested the same strenuous and efficient efforts that had characterized his labours in his former diocese. During Sept, 1893, he opened the new Kenrick Seminary and in Sept., 1896 he presided over the Third Diocesan Synod. At this Synod he introduced into the diocese the Third Baltimore Council legislations, and redistricted and readjusted <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> boundaries and regulated <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> matters in general. He also began the reorganization of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system. In September, 1902 he held the Fourth Diocesan Synod in which diocese legislation was further perfected. Other notable works of this energetic <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> were the purchasing of the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> site on Lindell Boulevard, the establishment of the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, the erecting of the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> residence, and the preliminary financing of the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> project. In all his works he showed himself possessed of a great <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and determination, and accomplished for the diocese by his energy, labour and endurance that which his venerable predecessor had during his late years planned, but because of his great age failed to accomplish. Archbishop Kain was a man of great earnestness and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of his counsels as well as for the intensity of his convictions; an admirable exemplar of progressive conservatism and conservative progressiveness. He held a high place in the American <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, as is evidenced from the fact of his being chosen from among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the country in 1884 as <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> of the Third Council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and that in 1895 he was selected to deliver the <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermon</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> on the occasion of the conferring of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> <a href="../cathen/02577a.htm">biretta</a> on <a href="../cathen/13486a.htm">His Eminence Cardinal Satolli</a>, the first <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a> to America. In 1902 his health failed, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> sent him at his request as coadjutor, with right of succession, the Rt. Rev. John Joseph Glenon, D.D., <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12101a.htm">Pinara</a>, and coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08597a.htm">Kansas</a> City. Mo. Archbishop Kain died at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 13 Oct., 1903. At the time of his death the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> census showed: city churches, 68; churches outside the city with resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, 124; missions 58; 1 <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>; 1 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; 268 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> priests; and 174 regulars; total 442. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, 220,000.
<h3>Third archbishop, John Joseph Glennon (1903-)</h3>

<p>He was born Kinnegad, Parish of Clonard, Co. Meath, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. He completed his studies at <a href="../cathen/01314b.htm">All Hallows College</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, came to America in 1883, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08602a.htm">Diocese of Kansas City</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of that city on 20 Dec., 1884. In 1893 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and on 29 June, 1896, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12101a.htm">Pinara</a> and coadjutor to Bishop Hogan of <a href="../cathen/08602a.htm">Kansas City</a>, Mo. He was transferred to St. Louis as coadjutor with the right of succession on 27 April, 1903, and succeeded to the See of St. Louis on 13 October of the same year. During the time of his administration the Archdiocese of St. Louis has advanced with rapid strides, both in temporal and spiritual matters. Many churches and institutions have been established and built, and Church legislation has been amplified and perfected by the Fifth and the Sixth Diocesan Synods called and presided over by him during the months of September of the years 1905 and 1908; also various charity organizations have been systematically perfected, and new ones founded to answer the needs of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, especially in congested districts. During his time we note the organization of the "Ephpheta Society" (1909), a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> whose object is to care for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> deaf-mute children of the poor and provide means for their <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>; the establishment of Father Dunne's Newsboys' Home in 1905; Father Dempsey's Hotel for Homeless Men in 1906; the introduction of the Helpers of the Holy Souls in 1903; the Brothers of Mary (Western Province College and <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in 1908); and the establishment of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlement <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and day nurseries in 1910. To this <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> has been entrusted the task of giving to St. Louis what had been the dream of <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Kenrick</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> of Kain &mdash; a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> worthy of the name and prestige of the Archdiocese of St. Louis. Soon after taking up Archbishop Kain's <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>, he set to work drafting plans and collecting funds for the erection of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of which was laid on Sunday, 18 Oct., 1908, by the Most Rev. <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a> Diomede Falconio, D.D., titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09004b.htm">Larissa</a>. On this occasion seventy-nine city <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> participated in the grand parade, making the largest demonstration ever seen in the city; it was also of extraordinary character in the nationalities represented.

<p>The exterior of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is an original conception, Byzantine in sentiment, developed in a beautiful gray granite which lends itself happily to majestic piling, and is simple but romantic in expression. The openings are treated in receding <a href="../cathen/04128c.htm">colonnades</a>, architraves, and archivolts, with profuse and elaborate carved and sculptured decorations, each <em>motif</em> being from a special design, original in character. The great central <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a>, forming the main central feature and rearing its cross 247 feet above the terrace, the main <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> with its imposing gable and deep receding central rose-window, and three great main entrances below, flanked on either side with imposing isolated towers giving great breadth to the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>, present a front of great dignity and charm. The sides, with many gabled entrances, one-story <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> and great clerestory windows, the suppressed towers at the angle of the <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a> and central <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a> form a beautiful combination, giving fine light-and-shadow effects. The building is roofed with a sea-green glazed tile; the typana of all the arches, illuminated with <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> in subdued colours, impart warmth and interest to the whole. The building has great bronze doors with sculptured panels depicting Biblical subjects. The interior is of a purely Byzantine type, an original composition in colours never before attempted in this type of church architecture. The general plan consists of two minor domes, a large central <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, with <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a> and <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a>, surrounded with spacious <a href="../cathen/01406b.htm">ambulatories</a>, through which the circuit of the church may be made without crossing the more sacred parts of the building. There are spacious <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> with groined and vaulted ceilings to the right and left of the sanctuary; these are dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> and the Blessed Virgin. Other <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of equal importance are on either side of the front minor <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a>, while, two <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a> form <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> dedicated to St. Louis and <a href="../cathen/06453a.htm">St. George</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/01406b.htm">ambulatory</a> circling these <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a> are Stations of the Cross in bronze. The <a href="../cathen/04128c.htm">colonnades</a> are of rare imported coloured marbles, the caps and bases of which are finished in gold with shadowed blues and reds. The ceilings, spandrels and arch balustrade are decorated with highly illuminated glass <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>, of varied interlacing geometric patterns and religious emblems. The interior presents an ever-changing, vista of design and colour when observed from different points of view.

<p>The statistics of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (1911) are as follows: <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, 1; <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 314; <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, 214; <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, 83; <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a>, 12; <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, 40; <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, 32; <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, 42; <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servite</a> Fathers, 2; Brothers of Mary, 3; total <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 528; churches in city, 83; churches outside city with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 151); total, 242; churches without resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 98; total churches, 340; stations, 66; <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 120; <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, 1; students,&uacute; <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, 7; students, 900; colleges and academies for boys, 8; students, 2500; academies for young ladies, 22; other institutions of higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a>, 15; <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in higher branches, 5000; <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the city, 69; number of pupils in city, 20,936; <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> outside of city, 110; pupils, 9645; total <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 179; total pupils, 30,581; newsboys' home, 1; hotel for working men, 1; <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>, 7; <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, 1500; House of the Good Shepherd, 1; children in preservation class,&uacute; deaf-mute asylums, 2; pupils, 190; industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 3; pupils, 300; total number of young people under <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> care, 40,321; <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and infirmaries, 16; patients during the year about 10,000; asylums, 4; homes for aged, 2; <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, about 375,000.

<p>The statistics of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> at the time of this writing, June, 1911, are as above quoted, but by "Brief of the Consistorial" dated <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 16 June, 1911, the northern portion of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has been detached and affiliated to the <a href="../cathen/13356b.htm">Diocese of St. Joseph</a>, Mo. This will necessitate a readjustment of the above figures which cannot just now be done with any degree of accuracy.
