<h1>St. Louis of Toulouse</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, generally represented vested in pontifical garments and holding a book and a <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>, b. at Brignoles, Provence, Feb., 1274; d. there, 19 Aug., 1297. He was the second son of Charles II of Anjou, called the Lame, King of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> (1288-1309), and nephew of St. Louis IX of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; and of Mary of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, whose great-aunt was <a href="../cathen/05389a.htm">St. Elizabeth of Hungary</a>. If in some and even early sources (Analecta Franciscana, IV, 310) he is called <em>primogenitus</em>, it is only because he succeeded to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of his eldest brother, <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a> (d. 1295). In 1288 Louis was sent with two of his brothers to the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Kingdom of Aragon</a> as hostage for his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, who had been defeated and captured in a naval battle off <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> by the <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilians</a> and <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragonians</a> (1284). During the seven years of their captivity (1288-95) in the castle of Sciurana, <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Diocese of Tarragona</a>, and partly in <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the three princes was entrusted to some <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, among whom were <a href="../cathen/12234a.htm">Ponzius Carbonelli</a> (Analecta Franciscana, IV, 310), Peter of Falgar, and <a href="../cathen/13045b.htm">Richard of Middleton</a> (Analecta Bollandiana, IX, 295). Peter John Olivi, the great <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Spiritual, was also one of their friends, who on 18 May, 1295, wrote them a long letter, published by Ehrle in "Archiv f. Litt. u. Kirchengesch.", III, 534- 40 (see ibid., 439-41). Louis outstripped his brothers both in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and learning, and, during a severe illness, made the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to become a <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friar Minor</a>.

<p>He was still in captivity when <a href="../cathen/03479b.htm">Celestine V</a> entrusted to him the administration of the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, on 7 Oct., 1294 (Bullar. Franc., IV, 332), having previously granted Francis of Apt, O.F.M., the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> confessor, the faculty of giving him the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">clerical tonsure</a> and <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> (cf. Bullar. Franc., 332). Neither <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> seems to have been carried out. From John of Orta (Anal. Boll., IX, 292) it appears that he was <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsured</a> only on 1 Nov., 1295, after his release. Louis then returned to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. After renouncing all the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of succession in favour of his brother Robert, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, and in 1296 <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> (Anal. Boll., IX, 314). <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> appointed the saintly young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, but Louis, wishing first to become a <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friar Minor</a>, received the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> habit in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> from the minister general, John Minio of Murro, on 24 Dec., 1296, and immediately made solemn profession. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> by <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> on 29 (30?) Dec., 1296 ("Bullar. Franc.", IV, 422; cf. "Anal. Boll.", IX, 297). After the Feast of <a href="../cathen/01203c.htm">St. Agatha</a> (5 Feb.), 1297, on which day he appeared for the first time publicly in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> habit, he betook himself to <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, where his mild figure and his virtues were admired by everybody. He was the father of the poor and a model of administration. But his episcopate was very brief, for on his return journey from a visit to his sister, the Queen of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, he was seized by fever and died at Brignoles.

<p>We have scarcely any record of literary work of St. Louis. Recently, however, Amelli, O.S.B., published in the "Archivium Franciscanum Historicum", II (Quaracchi, 1909), 378-83, a small treatise on music written by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, and from this it appears that he is also the author of a "Liber de Musicae Commendatione". Sbaralea ("Suppl. ad Script.", Rome, 1806, p. 498) ascribes to him also some sermons. His <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>, promoted by <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> in 1307 (Bullar. Franc., V, 39), was solemnized by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> on 7 April, 1317 (loc. cit., 111). His <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> reposed in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> church at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> till 1423, when they were taken by Alfonso V of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> of Valencia, of which town Louis became <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a>, celebrated in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> on 19 Aug., was decreed by the general chapter held at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> in 1319 (Anal. Franc., III, 473), and the rhythmical office, beginning <em>Tecum</em>, composed by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> brother, King Robert of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, was inserted in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> by the General Chapter of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> in 1343 (loc. cit., 539), but seems to have been abolished by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> reform of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> under <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> [sic, i.e., St. Pius V], 1568 (cf. Acta SS., Aug., III, 805).

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The best contemporary life is by the saint's chaplain, JOHN DE ORTA in Anal. Boll., IX (Paris and Brussels, 1890), 278-340; ibid., 341-51 (miracles); and in Anal. Ord. Min. Cap., XIII (Rome, 1897), 338-51, 360-72; XIV (1898), 16-27, 83- 92; some appendixes, ibid., 92-4, 120-6, 156-8, 181-3. A second old life is by PETER CALO, of which extracts are given in Acta SS., Aug., III, 781-97, passim; a compendium edited by PRESUTI in Archiv. Franc. Hist., I (Quaracchi, 1908), 278- 80; cf. ibid., 569-76 (miracles). BARTHOLOMEW OF PISA in Anal. Franc., IV (Quaracchi, 1906), 309-17; Chronicle of the XXIV Generals in Anal. Franc., III (Quaracchi, 1897), 447-52; BLUME AND DREVES, Anal. Hymnica Medii Aevii, XXVI (Leipzig, 1897), 265-74, give three rhythmical offices formerly used in Franciscan Breviaries. For some samples of notable hymns see EUSEBE CLOP, Cantus varii in usu apud nostrates (Tournai, 1902), 177-88. LEON, Lives of the Saints and Blessed of the Three Orders of St. Francis (Taunton, 1886), 26-49, tr. from the Aureole Seraphique, III. The best modern life is: VERLAQUE, Saint Louis, prince royal, eveque de Toulouse (Paris, 1885); DA PALMA, Vita di S. Lodovico d' Angio (Naples, 1855). On the iconography, see SALTER, Franciscan Legends in Italian Art (London, 1905), 180-182; BERTAUX, Les saints Louis dans l'art italien in Revue des Deux Mondes, CLVIII (Paris, 1900), 616-44; KLEINSCHMIDT, St. Ludwig von Toulouse in der Kunst in Archivium Franc.
