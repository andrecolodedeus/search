<h1>St. Lucy</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of <a href="../cathen/14395b.htm">Syracuse</a> in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated by <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latins</a> and <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greeks</a> alike on 13 December.

<p>According to the traditional <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">story</a>, she was born of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">rich</a> and noble <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> about the year 283. Her father was of Roman origin, but his early death left her dependent upon her mother, whose <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">name</a>, Eutychia, seems to indicate that she came of <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greek</a> stock.

<p>Like so many of the early <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, Lucy had <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and she hoped to devote all her <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">worldly goods</a> to the service of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>. Her mother was not so single-minded, but an occasion offered itself when Lucy could carry out her generous resolutions. The fame of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>-martyr <a href="../cathen/01203c.htm">Agatha</a>, who had been <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">executed</a> fifty-two years before in the <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, was attracting numerous visitors to her <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> at <a href="../cathen/03429a.htm">Catania</a>, not fifty miles from <a href="../cathen/14395b.htm">Syracuse</a>, and many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> had been wrought through her <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a>. Eutychia was therefore persuaded to make a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/03429a.htm">Catania</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> of being cured of a h&aelig;morrhage, from which she had been suffering for several years. There she was in fact cured, and Lucy, availing herself of the opportunity, persuaded her mother to allow her to <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">distribute</a> a great part of her <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> among the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>.

<p>The largess stirred the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">greed</a> of the unworthy youth to whom Lucy had been unwillingly <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>, and he denounced her to Paschasius, the Governor of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. It was in the year 303, during the fierce <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>. She was first of all condemned to suffer the shame of prostitution; but in the strength of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> she stood immovable, so that they could not drag her away to the place of shame. Bundles of wood were then heaped about her and set on fire, and again <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saved her. Finally, she met her death by the sword. But before she died she foretold the punishment of Paschasius and the speedy termination of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, adding that <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> would reign no more, and <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Maximian</a> would meet his end. So, strengthened with the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Bread of Life</a>, she won her crown of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.

<p>This beautiful <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">story</a> cannot unfortunately be accepted without <a href="../cathen/04503a.htm">criticism</a>. The details may be only a repetition of similar accounts of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> life and death. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> was not realized, if it required that <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Maximian</a> should die immediately after the termination of his reign. Paschasius, also, is a strange name for a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> to bear. However, since there is no other evidence by which the <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">story</a> may be tested, it can only be suggested that the facts peculiar to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">story</a> deserve special notice. Among these, the place and time of her death can hardly be questioned; for the rest, the most notable are her connexion with <a href="../cathen/01203c.htm">St. Agatha</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> cure of Eutychia, and it is to be hoped that these have not been introduced by the pious compiler of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">story</a> or a popular instinct to link together two national <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">story</a>, such as we have given it, is to be traced back to the <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acta</a>, and these probably belong to the fifth century. Though they cannot be regarded as accurate, there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of the great <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">veneration</a> that was shown to St. Lucy by the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>. She is one of those few <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> whose <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">names</a> occur in the <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">canon</a> of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, and there are special <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and antiphons for her in his "Sacramentary" and <a href="../cathen/01579a.htm">"Antiphonary"</a>. She is also <a href="../cathen/04155a.htm">commemorated</a> in the ancient <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">Martyrology</a>. <a href="../cathen/01280b.htm">St. Aldhelm</a> (d. 709) is the first writer who uses her <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts</a> to give a full account of her life and death. This he does in prose in the "Tractatus de Laudibus Virginitatis" (Tract. xliii, P.L., LXXXIX, 142) and again, in verse, in the poem "De Laudibus Virginum" (P.L., LXXXIX, 266). Following him, the <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> inserts the <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">story</a> in his <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">Martyrology</a>.

<p>With regard to her <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, <a href="../cathen/13783c.htm">Sigebert</a> (1030-1112), a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="../cathen/06407c.htm">Gembloux</a>, in his "sermo de Sancta Lucia", says that he body lay undisturbed in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> for 400 years, before Faroald, Duke of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, captured the island and transferred the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> body to Corfinium in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Thence it was removed by the <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Emperor Otho I</a>, 972, to <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> and deposited in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Vincent. And it was from this shrine that an arm of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was taken to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Luitburg in the <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Diocese of Spires</a>--an incident celebrated by <a href="../cathen/13783c.htm">Sigebert</a> himself in verse.

<p>The subsequent history of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> is not clear. On their capture of Constantinople in 1204, the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> found some of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> in that city, and the Doge of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> secured them for the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. George at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. In the year 1513 the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> presented to Louis XII of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the head of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, which he deposited in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>. Another account, however, states that the head was brought to <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a> from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> whither it had been transferred during the time when the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> rested in Corfinium.
