<h1>St. Ludger</h1>  

<p>(L&uuml;diger or Liudger)

<p>Missionary among the Frisians and Saxons, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Munster in <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, b. at Zuilen near Utrecht about 744; d. 26 March, 809. Feast, 26 March. Represented as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> reciting his <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, or with a swan at either side. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, Thiadgrim and Liafburg, were wealthy Frisians of noble lineage. In 753 Ludger saw the great apostle of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, and this sight and the subsequent <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> made deep impressions on his youthful mind. At his urgent request he was sent to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> which <a href="../cathen/07021a.htm">St. Gregory</a> [of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, Abbot (c.707-c.775)] had founded at <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, and made good progress. In 767 <a href="../cathen/07021a.htm">Gregory</a>, who did not wish to receive episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> himself, sent Alubert, who had come from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to assist him in his missionary work, to York to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Ludger accompanied him to receive <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deaconship</a> and to study under <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, but after a year returned to Utrecht. Some time later he was granted an opportunity to continue his studies in the same <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and here contracted a friendship with <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> which lasted throughout life. In 773 a friction arose between the Anglo-Saxons and the Frisians, and Ludger, to provide for his personal safety, left for home, taking with him a number of valuable books. In 775 he was sent to Deventer to restore the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> Saxons and to find the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/09106b.htm">St. Lebwin</a> (Liafwin), who had laboured there as missionary, had built the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and had died there. Ludger was successful in his undertaking, and then taught in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>. He and some others were next sent north to destroy the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> places of worship west of the Lauwers Zee.

<p>After Ludger had been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> at Cologne in 777 the missions of Ostergau (Ostracha, i.e., Eastern Friesland) were committed to his charge, and Dokkum, the place of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, was made the centre. During each autumn he came to Utrecht to teach at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. In this manner he toiled for about seven years, until Widukind, the indomitable leader of the Saxons, induced the Frisians to drive out the missionaries, burn the churches, and return to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> gods. Ludger escaped with his disciples. In 785 he visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was well received by Pope Adrian, and obtained from him good counsel and special faculties. From <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he went to <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, where he lived according to the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>, but did not bind himself by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. The news of Widukind's submission, and the arrival of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> at <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> in 787, put an end to Ludger's peaceful retirement. He was appointed missionary to the five districts at the mouth of the Ems, which was still occupied almost entirely by <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>. With his usual energy and unbounded confidence in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> he began his work; and, knowing the language and habits of the people, he was able to turn to advantage many national traits in effecting their conversion. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no bounds; the island of Bant, long since swallowed by the sea, is mentioned as the scene of his apostolic work. He visited Heligoland (Fossitesland), where <a href="../cathen/15645a.htm">St. Willibrord</a> had preached; he destroyed the remaining vestiges of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a>, and built a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> temple. The well once sacred to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> gods became his <a href="../cathen/02274a.htm">baptismal font</a>. On his return he met the blind bard Berulef, cured his blindness, and made him a devout <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.

<p>In 793 (Hist. Jahrb., I, 282) <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> wished to make Ludger <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, but he declined the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, while declaring himself willing to undertake the evangelizing of the Saxons. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> gladly accepted the offer, and North-western Saxony was thus added to Ludger's missionary field. To defray <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> expenses the income of the Abbey of Leuze, in the present <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Province of Hainaut, was given him, and he was told to pick his fellow-labourers from the members of that <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. As Mimigernaford (Mimigardeford, Miningarvard) had been designated the centre of the new district, Ludger built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (<em>monasterium</em>) there, from which the place took its name Munster. Here he lived with his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> according to the rule of <a href="../cathen/03729b.htm">St. Chrodegang</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, which in 789 had been made <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> territories (Schmitz Kallenberg, "Monasticon Westphaliae", Munster, 1909, p. 62, places the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of foundation between 805 and 809). He also built a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> on the left of the Aa in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, besides the churches of Billerbeck, Coesfeld, Herzfeld, Nottuln, and others. Near the church of Nottuln he built a home for his sister, St. Gerburgis, who had <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> herself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Many <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> virgins soon gathered about her, and so arose the first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> (c. 803). At the request of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, Ludger received episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> some time between 13 Jan., 802, and 23 April, 805, for on the first date he is still styled <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, while on the latter he is called <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (Hist. Jahrb., I, 283). His principal care was to have a good and efficient <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. He, to a great extent, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> his students personally, and generally took some of them on his missionary tours. Since his sojourn at <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> Ludger had entertained the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of founding a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. During the past years he had been acquiring <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and looking for a suitable location. At length he decided upon Werden; but it was only in 799 that building began in earnest, and in 804 that he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the church.

<p>On <a href="../cathen/11535a.htm">Passion Sunday</a>, 809, Ludger heard Mass at Coesfeld early in the morning and preached, then went to Billerbeck, where at nine o'clock he again preached, and said his last Mass. That evening he expired peacefully amidst his faithful followers. A dispute arose between Munster and Werden for the possession of his body. His brother Hildegrim being appealed to, after consultation with the emperor, decided in favour of Werden, and here the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> have rested for eleven centuries. Portions have been brought to Munster and Billerbeck. From 22 June to 4 July, 1909, the Diocese of Munster celebrated the eleventh centenary. "Bishop Hermann Dingelstad, the present successor of the apostle, celebrated the Jubilee, uniting it with the golden jubilee of his own <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. A most touching scene was witnessed when thousands of men, who had come from far and near, after a stirring sermon of the orator-bishop of Treves, Mgr Felix Korum, renewed their <a href="../cathen/02275a.htm">baptismal vows</a> at the same well from which St. Ludgerus had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> their forefathers. A <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and eleven <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, among them the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> Frisian home, <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, and <a href="../cathen/16040b.htm">Cardinal Fischer</a> of Cologne, took part in the sacred celebrations" ("America", I, 381).
