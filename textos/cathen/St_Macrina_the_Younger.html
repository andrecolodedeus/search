<h1>St. Macrina the Younger</h1>  

<p>Born about 330; died 379. She was the eldest child of Basil and Elder Emmelia, the granddaughter of <a href="../cathen/09508b.htm">St. Macrina the Elder</a>, and the sister of the Cappadocian Fathers, Sts. Basil and <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a>. The last-mentioned has left us a biography of his sister in the form of a panegyric ("Vita Macrinae Junioris" in PG XLVI, 960 sq.). She received an excellent <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> training, though one based more on the study of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Bible</a> than on that of profane literature. When she was but twelve years old, her father had already arranged a marriage for her with a young advocate of excellent <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Soon afterwards, however, her <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">affianced</a> husband died suddenly, and Macrina resolved to devote herself to a life of perpetual <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> and the pursuit of <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a>. She exercised great influence over the religious training of her younger brothers, especially <a href="../cathen/11773c.htm">St. Peter</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13667a.htm">Sebaste</a>, and through her <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory</a> received the greatest <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> stimulation. On the death of their father, Basil took her, with their mother, to a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> estate on the River Iris, in <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>. Here, with their servants and other companions, they led a life of retirement, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> themselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Strict <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">asceticism</a>, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> meditation on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of Christanity, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> were the chief concerns of this community. Not only the brothers of St. Macrina but also <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a> and <a href="../cathen/05628b.htm">Eustathius of Sebaste</a> were associated with this <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> circle and were there stimulated to make still further advances towards <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a>. After the death her mother Emmelia, Macrina became the head of this community, in which the fruit of the earnest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">christian</a> life matured so <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a>. On his return from a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> of Antioch, towards the end of 379, <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> visited his deeply <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> sister, and found her grievously ill. In <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> discourse the brother and sister spoke of the life beyond and of the meeting in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Soon afterwards Macrina passed blissfully to her reward. <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory</a> composed a "Dialogue on the Soul and Resurrection" (<em>peri psyches kai anastaseos</em>), treating of his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> discourse with his dying sister. In this, Macrina appears as teacher, and treats of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, death, the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, and the restoration of all things. Hence the title of the work, <em>ta Makrinia</em> (P.G. XLVI, 12 sq.). Her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 19 July.
