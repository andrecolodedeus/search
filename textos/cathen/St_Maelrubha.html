<h1>St. Maelrubha</h1>  

<p>(MA-RUI, MOLROY, ERREW, SUMMARYRUFF, also SAGART-RUADH)

<p>An <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, founder of Abercrossan, b. 642; d. 21 April, 722. He was descended from Niall, King of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, on the side of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> Elganach. His mother, Subtan, was a niece of <a href="../cathen/04152c.htm">St. Comgall</a> the Great, of Bangor. St. Maelrubha was born in the county of Derry and was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Bangor. When he was in his thirtieth year he sailed from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> for <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, with a following of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. For two years he travelled about, chiefly in Argyll, and founded about half-a dozen churches then settled at Abercrossan (Applecross), in the west of <a href="../cathen/13201a.htm">Ross</a>. Here he built his chief church and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the midst of the Pictish folk, and thence he set out on missionary journeys, westward to the islands Skye and Lewis, eastward to Forres and Keith, and northward to Loch Shinn, Durness, and Farr. It was on this last journey that he was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> by <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> vikings, probably at Teampull, about nine miles up Strath-Naver from Farr, where he had built a cell. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> close to the River Naver, not far from his cell, and his grave is still marked by "a rough cross-marked stone". The tradition, in the "Aberdeen Breviary", that he was killed at Urquhart and buried at Abercrossan is probably a mistake arising from a confusion of Gaelic place-names.

<p>This <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> had been copied by several later hagiologists, as has also the same writers' confusion of St. Maelrubha with Sts. Rufus of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>. Maelrubha was, after St. Columba, perhaps the most popular saint of the north-west of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. At least twenty-one churches are dedicated to him, and Dean Reeves enumerates about forty forms of his name. His death occurred on 21 April, and his feast has always been kept in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> on this day; but in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> (probably owing to the confusion with Sts. Rufus) it was kept on 27 August. On 5 July, 1898, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> restored his feast for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, to be kept on 27 August.
