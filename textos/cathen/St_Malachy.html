<h1>St. Malachy</h1>  

<p>St. Malachy, whose family name was O'Morgair, was born in <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a> in 1094. <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> describes him as of noble birth.

<p>He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> Maelmhaedhoc (a name which has been Latinized as Malachy) and was trained under Imhar O'Hagan, subsequently <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>. After a long course of studies he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by St. Cellach (Celsus) in 1119. In order to perfect himself in <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">sacred liturgy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, he proceeded to <a href="../cathen/09284a.htm">Lismore</a>, where he spent nearly two years under St. Malchus. He was then chosen <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/02250a.htm">Bangor</a>, in 1123. A year later, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05147a.htm">Connor</a>, and, in 1132, he was promoted to the <a href="../cathen/12423a.htm">primacy</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> gives us many interesting anecdotes regarding St. Malachy, and highly praises his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for religion both in Connor and <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>. In 1127 he paid a second visit to <a href="../cathen/09284a.htm">Lismore</a> and acted for a time as confessor to Cormac MacCarthy, Prince of Desmond. While <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05147a.htm">Connor</a>, he continued to reside at <a href="../cathen/02250a.htm">Bangor</a>, and when some of the native princes sacked Connor, he brought the <a href="../cathen/02250a.htm">Bangor</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to Iveragh, County Kerry, where they were welcomed by King Cormac. On the death of St. Celsus (who was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> at <a href="../cathen/09284a.htm">Lismore</a> in 1129), St. Malachy was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, 1132, which <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">dignity</a> he accepted with great reluctance. Owing to intrigues, he was unable to take possession of his see for two years; even then he had to purchase the Bachal Isu (Staff of Jesus) from Niall, the usurping <a href="../cathen/09092a.htm">lay-primate</a>.

<p>During three years at <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> writes, St. Malachy restored the <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a>, grown lax during the <a href="../cathen/08082a.htm">intruded</a> rule of a series of <a href="../cathen/09092a.htm">lay-abbots</a>, and had the Roman <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Liturgy</a> adopted.

<p><a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> continues: Having extirpated barbarism and re-established <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, seeing all things tranquil he began to think of his own peace. He therefore resigned <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, in 1138, and returned to Connor, dividing the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> into <a href="../cathen/05147a.htm">Down and Connor</a>, retaining the former. He founded a <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Austin Canons</a> at Downpatrick, and was unceasing in his episcopal labours.

<p>Early in 1139 he journeyed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, via <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, visiting <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> at <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a>. He petitioned <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Pope Innocent</a> for <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">palliums</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Sees</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a> and <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a>, and was appointed <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> for <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. On his return visit to <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a> he obtained five <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> for a foundation in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, under Christian, an Irishman, as superior: thus arose the great <a href="../cathen/10168a.htm">Abbey of Mellifont</a> in 1142. St. Malachy set out on a second journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1148, but on arriving at <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a> he fell sick, and died in the arms of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, on 2 November.

<p>Numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are recorded of him, and he was also endowed with the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. St. Malachy was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/04018a.htm">Pope Clement (III)</a>, on 6 July, 1199, and his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 3 November, in order not to clash with the <a href="../cathen/01315b.htm">Feast of All Souls</a>.

<p>An account of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Malachy will be found in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, <em>Patrologiae cursus completus</em>, CLXXXV.

<p>For a discussion of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecies</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, known as St. Malachy's Prophecies, the reader is referred to the article <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm#malachy">PROPHECIES</a>.
