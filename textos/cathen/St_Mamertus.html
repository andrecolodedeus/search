<h1>St. Mamertus</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vienne, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; died shortly after 475. Concerning the life of Mamertus before his elevation to the See of Vienne, nothing certain is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. The fact that his brother, Claudianus Mamertus, the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> writer, received in his youth a sound training in rhetoric, and enjoyed the personal acquaintance of Bishop Eucherius of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> (434-50), suggests that the brothers belonged to a wealthy Gallic <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> from the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. Like his brother, St. Mamertus was distinguished for his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of profane subjects as well as of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and, before his elevation to the episcopate, appears to have been married. His election and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> took place shortly before 462. As <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> he enlisted the services of his brother, who had withdrawn to a <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> him <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Vienne. The activity of the brothers is described in a letter of Sidonius Apollinaris (Epist., IV, xi), another of whose letters (VII, i) is addressed to Bishop Mamertus. In 463 Mamertus was engaged in a dispute with Pope Hilarius on the question of the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Arles. <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Pope Leo I</a> had regulated the boundaries of the ecclesiastical provinces of Arles and Vienne: under the latter he left the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a>, <a href="../cathen/14454a.htm">Tarentaise</a>, <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, and Grenoble, but all the other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in this district were made subordinate to Arles. Regardless of this decision and infringing on the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of his colleague of Arles, Mamertus <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 463 a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for the city of Die (Dea). King Gundiac of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> complained to Pope Hilary of this action, whereupon the latter wrote to Bishop Leontius of Arles on 10 Oct., 463, bidding him summon a synod of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from the different provinces to enquire into the matter. In a subsequent letter to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the provinces of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, Vienne, Narbonnensis I and II, and Alpina, he also refers to the matter, and directs them to obey Leontius's summons to a regularly constituted synod (Thiel, "Epist. Rom. Pont.", I, cxlvi, cli; Jaff&eacute;, "Regesta Rom. Pont.", I, 2nd ed., dlvi, dlix). The synod decided against Mamertus, as we learn from another letter of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 25 February, 464 (Thiel, op. cit., I, cxlviii; Jaff&eacute;, op. cit., I, dlvii). In this Hilary declares that Mamertus and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> unlawfully <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by him should really be deposed; desiring, however that clemency be used, he commissioned Bishop Veranus to inform Mamertus that, if he did not recognize and submit to the regulations of Pope Leo, he would be deprived also of the four suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, still subject to Vienne. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> invalidly installed by Mamertus was to be confirmed in his office by Leontius, after which he might retain the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. Mamertus evidently submitted, since we find no subsequent reference to the incident.

<p>During his episcopate, the remains of St. Ferreolus were discovered, and were translated by Mamertus to a church in Vienne, built in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> (<a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a>, "De gloria mart.", II, ii). St. Mamertus was the founder of the Rogation Processions (see <a href="../cathen/13110b.htm">ROGATION DAYS</a>), as we learn on the testimony of Sidonius Apollinaris (Epist., V, xiv; VII, i), and his second successor, Avitus ("Homilia de Rogat." in P.L., LIX, 289-94). In connexion with these intercessory processions, Mamertus summoned a synod at Vienne between 471 and 475. About 475 he attended a synod at Arles, which dealt with the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> teaching of Lucidus, a Gallic <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. As this is the latest information we possess concerning him, we may assume that he died shortly afterwards. After his death he was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a saint. His name stands in the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum" and in the "Martyrologium" of Florus of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> under 11 May, on which day his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is still celebrated (Quentin, "Les martyrologes historiques", 348).
