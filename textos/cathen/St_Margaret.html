<h1>St. Margaret</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">Virgin</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>; also called M<font size=-2>ARINA</font>; belonged to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm#II">Pisidian Antioch</a> in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, where her father was a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Her mother dying soon after her birth, Margaret was nursed by a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> five or six leagues from Antioch. Having embraced <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> her virginity to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, she was disowned by her father and adopted by her nurse.

<p>While she was one day engaged in watching the flocks of her mistress, a <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> Roman prefect named Olybrius caught sight of her, and attracted by her great beauty sought to make her his <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a> or wife. When neither cajolery nor threats of punishment could succeed in moving her to yield to his desires, he had her brought before him in public trial at Antioch. Threatened with death unless she renounced the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> refused to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the gods of the empire and an attempt was made to burn her, but the flames, we are told in her Acts, left her unhurt. She was then bound hand and foot and thrown into a cauldron of boiling water, but at her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> her bonds were broken and she stood up uninjured. Finally the prefect ordered her to be beheaded.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> her under the name Marine on 13 July; the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a>, as Margaret on 20 July. Her Acts place her death in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> (A.D. 303-5), but in fact even the century to which she belonged is uncertain. St. Margaret is represented in art sometimes as a shepherdess, or as leading a chained dragon, again carrying a little cross or a girdle in her hand, or standing by a large vessel which recalls the cauldron into which she was plunged. <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">Relics</a> said to belong to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> are <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in very many parts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>; at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/10529a.htm">Montefiascone</a>, Brusels, <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, Paris, Froidmont, <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, and various other places. Curiously enough this virgin has been widely <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> for many centuries as a special <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who are pregnant.
