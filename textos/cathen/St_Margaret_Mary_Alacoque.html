<h1>St. Margaret Mary Alacoque</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">Religious</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15481a.htm">Visitation Order</a>. Apostle of the <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">Devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus</a>, born at Lhautecour, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 22 July, 1647; died at <a href="../cathen/11476b.htm">Paray-le-Monial</a>, 17 October, 1690.

<p>Her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, Claude Alacoque and Philiberte Lamyn, were distinguished less for <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">temporal possessions</a> than for their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which gave them an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> position. From early childhood Margaret showed intense <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, and preferred <a href="../cathen/13790a.htm">silence</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to childish amusements. After her first <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">communion</a> at the age of nine, she practised in secret severe <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">corporal mortifications</a>, until paralysis confined her to bed for four years. At the end of this period, having made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> herself to <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, she was instantly restored to perfect health. The death of her father and the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> of a relative plunged the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poverty</a> and humiliation, after which more than ever Margaret found consolation in the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> made her sensible of His presence and protection. He usually <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">appeared</a> to her as the Crucified or the <em>Ecce Homo</em>, and this did not surprise her, as she thought others had the same Divine assistance. When Margaret was seventeen, the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was recovered, and her mother besought her to establish herself in the world. Her filial tenderness made her believe that the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of childhood was not binding, and that she could serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> at home by <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> and <a href="../cathen/12236a.htm">charity to the poor</a>. Then, still bleeding from her self-imposed <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">austerities</a>, she began to take part in the pleasures of the world. One night upon her return from a ball, she had a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as He was during the scourging, reproaching her for infidelity after He had given her so many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. During her entire life Margaret mourned over two faults committed at this time--the wearing of some superfluous ornaments and a mask at the carnival to please her brothers.

<p>On 25 May, 1671, she entered the <a href="../cathen/15481a.htm">Visitation</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">Convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/11476b.htm">Paray</a>, where she was subjected to many trials to prove her <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">vocation</a>, and in November, 1672, pronounced her final <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. She had a delicate constitution, but was gifted with intelligence and good judgement, and in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> she chose for herself what was most repugnant to her nature, making her life one of inconceivable sufferings, which were often relieved or instantly cured by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, Who acted as her Director, <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">appeared</a> to her frequently and conversed with her, confiding to her the mission to establish the <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">devotion to His Sacred Heart</a>. These extraordinary occurrences drew upon her the adverse criticism of the <a href="../cathen/15481a.htm">community</a>, who treated her as a visionary, and her superior commanded her to live the common life. But her <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, her <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, and invariable <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> towards those who persecuted her, finally prevailed, and her mission, accomplished in the crucible of suffering, was recognized even by those who had shown her the most bitter opposition.

<p>Margaret Mary was inspired by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to establish the Holy Hour and to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> lying prostrate with her face to the ground from eleven till midnight on the eve of the first Friday of each month, to share in the mortal sadness He endured when abandoned by His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> in His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Agony</a>, and to receive <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">holy Communion</a> on the first Friday of every month. In the first great <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">revelation</a>, He made known to her His ardent desire to be <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and His design of manifesting His <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">Heart</a> with all Its treasures of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and mercy, of sanctification and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. He appointed the Friday after the <a href="../cathen/11204a.htm">octave</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> as the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">Sacred Heart</a>; He called her "the Beloved Disciple of the <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">Sacred Heart</a>", and the heiress of all Its treasures. The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">Sacred Heart</a> was the fire which consumed her, and <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">devotion to the Sacred Heart</a> is the refrain of all her writings. In her last illness she refused all alleviation, repeating frequently: "What have I in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and what do I desire on earth, but Thee alone, O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>", and died pronouncing the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">Holy Name of Jesus</a>.

<p>The discussion of the mission and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of Margaret Mary continued for years. All her actions, her <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">revelations</a>, her spiritual maxims, her teachings regarding the <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">devotion to the Sacred Heart</a>, of which she was the chief exponent as well as the apostle, were subjected to the most severe and minute examination, and finally the Sacred Congregation of rites passed a favourable vote on the <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">heroic virtues</a> of this servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In March, 1824, <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> pronounced her Venerable, and on 18 September, 1864, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> declared her <a href="../cathen/02597b.htm">Blessed</a>. When her <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> was canonically opened in July, 1830, two instantaneous cures took place. Her body rests under the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> at <a href="../cathen/11476b.htm">Paray</a>, and many striking favours have been obtained by <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> attracted thither from all parts of the world. Her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 17 October. [<em>Editor's Note:</em> St. Margaret Mary was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Benedict XV in 1920.]
