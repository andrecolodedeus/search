<div id="springfield2">
<h1>St. Margaret of Scotland</h1>  

<p>Born about 1045, died 16 Nov., 1092, was a daughter of Edward "Outremere", or "the Exile", by Agatha, kinswoman of Gisela, the wife of <a href="../cathen/14287a.htm">St. Stephen of Hungary</a>. She was the granddaughter of Edmund Ironside. A constant tradition asserts that Margaret's father and his brother Edmund were sent to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> for safety during the reign of <a href="../cathen/03306c.htm">Canute</a>, but no record of the fact has been found in that country. The <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of Margaret's birth cannot be ascertained with accuracy, but it must have been between the years 1038, when <a href="../cathen/14287a.htm">St. Stephen</a> died, and 1057, when her father returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. It appears that Margaret came with him on that occasion and, on his death and the conquest of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> by the Normans, her mother Agatha decided to return to the Continent. A storm however drove their ship to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, where Malcolm III received the party under his protection, subsequently taking Margaret to wife. This event had been delayed for a while by Margaret's desire to entire religion, but it took place some <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> between 1067 and 1070.

<p>In her position as queen, all Margaret's great influence was thrown into the cause of religion and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. A <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> was held, and among the special reforms instituted the most important were the regulation of the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten fast</a>, observance of the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> communion, and the removal of certain abuses concerning <a href="../cathen/01178a.htm">marriage within the prohibited degrees</a>. Her private life was given up to constant <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and practices of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. She founded several churches, including the <a href="../cathen/05192a.htm">Abbey of Dunfermline</a>, built to enshrine her greatest treasure, a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">true Cross</a>. Her book of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, richly adorned with jewels, which one day dropped into a river and was according to legend <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> recovered, is now in the Bodleian <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> at Oxford. She foretold the day of her death, which took place at <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a> on 16 Nov., 1093, her body being <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> before the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> at <a href="../cathen/05192a.htm">Dunfermline</a>.

<p>In 1250 Margaret was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, and her <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were translated on 19 June, 1259, to a new shrine, the base of which is still visible beyond the modern east wall of the restored church. At the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> her head passed into the possession of <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Queen of Scots</a>, and later was secured by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, where it is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have perished during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. According to George Conn, "De duplici statu religionis apud Scots" (Rome, 1628), the rest of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, together with those of Malcolm, were acquired by <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II of Spain</a>, and placed in two urns in the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a>. When, however, <a href="../cathen/06560c.htm">Bishop Gillies</a> of <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a> applied through <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> for their restoration to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, they could not be found.

<p>The chief authority for Margaret's life is the contemporary biography printed in "Acta SS.", II, June, 320. Its authorship has been ascribed to <a href="../cathen/15092c.htm">Turgot</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> confessor, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> and later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of St. Andrews, and also to Theodoric, a somewhat obscure <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>; but in spite of much controversy the point remains quite unsettled. The <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of <a href="../cathen/09652b.htm">St. Margaret</a> is now observed by the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on 10 June.
