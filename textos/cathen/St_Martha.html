<h1>St. Martha</h1>  

<p>Mentioned only in <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#vrs38">Luke 10:38-42</a>; and <a href="../bible/joh011.htm">John 11, 12, sqq.</a> The Aramaic form occurs in a Nabat&aelig;an inscription found at Puteoli, and now in the Naples Museum; it is dated A.D. 5 (Corpus Inscr. Semit., 158); also in a Palmyrene inscription, where the Greek translation has the form <em>Marthein</em>, A.D. 179.

<p><a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary</a>, Martha, and <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> are represented by St. John as living at Bethania, but St. Luke would seem to imply that they were, at least at one time, living in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>; he does not mention the name of the town, but it may have been <a href="../cathen/09523a.htm">Magdala</a>, and we should thus, supposing Mary of Bethania and <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalene</a> to be the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, understand the appellative "Magdalene". The words of St. John (11:1) seem to imply a change of residence for the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. It is possible, too, that St. Luke has displaced the incident referred to in Chapter 10. The likeness between the pictures of Martha presented by Luke and John is very remarkable. The familiar intercourse between the Saviour of the world and the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> which St. Luke depicts is dwelt on by St. John when he tells us that "Jesus <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> Martha, and her sister Mary, and Lazarus" (11:5). Again the picture of Martha's anxiety (<a href="../bible/joh011.htm#vrs20">John 11:20-21, 39</a>) accords with the picture of her who was "busy about much serving" (<a href="../bible/luk010.htm#vrs40">Luke 10:40</a>); so also in <a href="../bible/joh012.htm#vrs2">John 12:2</a>: "They made him a supper there: and Martha served." But St. John has given us a glimpse of the other and deeper side of her character when he depicts her growing <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Divinity (11:20-27), a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which was the occasion of the words: "I am the resurrection and the life." The <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> has beautifully indicated the change that came over Martha after that interview: "When she had said these things, she went and called her sister Mary secretly, saying: The Master is come, and calleth for thee."

<p>Difficulties have been raised about the last supper at Bethania. St. John seems to put it six days before the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a>, and, so some conclude, in the house of Martha; while the Synoptic account puts it two days before the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a>, and in the house of Simon the Leper. We need not try to avoid this difficulty by asserting that there were two suppers; for St. John does not say that the supper took place six days before, but only that Christ arrived in Bethania six days before the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a>; nor does he say that it was in the house of Martha. We are surely justified in arguing that, since St. Matthew and St. Mark place the scene in the house of Simon, St. John must be understood to say the same; it remains to be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that Martha could not "serve" in Simon's house.
