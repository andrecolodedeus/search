<h1>St. Martin of Braga</h1>  

<p>(Bracara; or, of Dumio).

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer; b. about 520 in Pannonia; d. in 580 at <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. He made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Palestine, where he became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and met some Spanish <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> whose narrations induced him to come to Galicia (Northwestern <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>) with the purpose of converting the Suevi, some of whom were still half <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> and others <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. He arrived in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in 550, founded various <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, among them that of Dumio, of which he became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. At the <a href="../cathen/02729a.htm">Synod of Braga</a>, in May, 561, he signed as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dumio. Later he became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> and, as such, presided over the second Council of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> in 572. He was successful in converting the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> Galicians and rooting out the last remnants of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> among them. He is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a> being 20 March. His great learning and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> are attested by <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> (Hist. Franc., V, xxxviii), who styles him full of virtue (<em>plenus virtutibus</em>) and second to none of his contemporaries in learning ("in tantum se litteris imbuit ut nulli secundus sui temporis haberetur").

<p>His writings consist chiefly of moral, <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> treatises. The best known of his moral treatises, "Formula vitae honestae" or "De differentiis quatuor virtutum", as St. Isadore of Seville (De viris illustribus xxxv) entitles it, is an exposition of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life chiefly for <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, from the standpoint of the four cardinal virtues, and is believed to be based on a lost work of Seneca. His little work, "De ira", is merely a compendium of Seneca's three books, "De ira". The two preceding works proceed from the standpoint of natural ethics, while his three other moral treatises: "Pro repellenda jactantia", "De superbia", and "Exhortatio humilitatis", are expositions of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> morality. Of great importance in the history of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> canon law is Martin's collection of eighty-four canons: "Collectio orientalium canonum, seu Capitula Martini", which was compiled after 561, and contains mostly Greek, also a few Spanish and African, canons. It is in two parts; the first, containing sixty-eight canons, treats of the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>; the second, containing sixteen canons, treats chiefly of the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and faults of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. His two <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> works are a little treatise: "De pascha", in which he explains to the people the reason why <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> is celebrated at variable periods between IX Kal. April, and XI Kal. Maii, and "Epistola ad Bonifatium de trina mersione", in answer to a letter from a <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who supposed that the custom of triple aspersion in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> origin. His <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> works are "Sententiae patrum &AElig;gyptiorum", a collection of edifying narratives concerning <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> monastic life, and of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> sayings of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, which he translated from the Greek; and another work of similar nature,"Verba seniorum", translated from the Greek by Paschasius, a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of Dumio, by order and with the help of Martin. He also wrote an interesting sermon "De correctione rusticorum", against the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a> which were still prevalent among the peasantry of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. There are also extant three poetical inscriptions, "In basilico", "In refectorio", "Epistaphium". No complete edition of Martin's works has ever been published. His "Formula vitae honestae", "Libellus de moribus" (spurious), "Pro repellanda jactantia", "De superbia", "Exhortatio humilitatis", "De ira", "De pascha", and the three poetical inscriptions are printed in <a href="../cathen/06349c.htm">Gallandi</a>, "Bibl. Vet. Patr.", XII, 275-288, and in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., LXXII, 21-52. <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> also reprints "Verba seniorum" (P.L. LXXIII, 1025-62);" "AEgyptiorum patrum sententiae (P.L., LXXIV, 381-394); "Capitula Martini" (P.L., 574-586). The sermon, "De correctione rusticorum" was edited with notes and a learned disquisition on Martin's life and writings by C.P. Caspari (Christiania, 1883). The epistle, "De trina mersione", is printed in "Collectio maxima conciliorum Hispaniae" II (Rome, 1693), 506, and in "Espa a sagrada", XV (Madrid, 1759), 422. The latest editions of the "Formula honestae vitae" were prepared by Weidner (Magdeburg, 1872) and May (Neisse, 1892). The treatise "De pascha" was recently edited by Burn, in "Niceta of <a href="../cathen/12763a.htm">Remesiana</a>" (Cambridge, 1905), 93 sq.
