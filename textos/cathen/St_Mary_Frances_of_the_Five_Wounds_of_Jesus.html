<h1>St. Mary Frances of the Five Wounds of Jesus</h1>  

<p>Of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Third Order of St. Francis</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, 25 March, 1715; d. there, 6 October, 1791. Her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> belonged to the middle class. Her father, Francesco Gallo, was a severe, <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avaricious</a> man with a passionate temper, and from him the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> had much to suffer. He subjected her to much ill-treatment and hard, incessant labour which often brought her to the verge of the grave. Barbara Basinsin, her mother, however, was gentle, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, and patient in bearing with the brutal conduct of her husband. Before her birth <a href="../cathen/08466a.htm">St. John Joseph of the Cross</a>, O.F.M., and <a href="../cathen/06218b.htm">St. Francis de Geronimo</a>, S.J., are said to have predicted Mary's future <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. At the age of seven she was admitted to <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, which she was subsequently in the habit of receiving daily. When Mary Frances was sixteen years old, her father sought to force her into a marriage with a rich young man, but the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> firmly refused, and instead asked leave to enter the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis. This request was at length granted her through the influence of Father Theophilus, a <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friar Minor</a>. At her reception among the Tertiaries of St. Peter of Alcantara, 8 September, 1731, she took the name of "Mary Frances of the Five Wounds of Jesus" out of devotion to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Sacred Passion</a>. Her body is said to have been signed with the <a href="../cathen/14294b.htm">stigmata</a>, which, at her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, took no outward, visible appearance, and on Fridays, especially the Fridays of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, she felt in her body the very pains of the Passion. During her whole life the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> had much to suffer from bodily ills, and to her physical suffering was added <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> pain from the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of her father, sisters, and other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Even her confessors, to test her <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, made her suffer by the severity of their direction. But over and above these <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> and physical sufferings she imposed upon herself <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> penances, strict <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, hair-shirts, and disciplines. Her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and advice saved many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from dangers. Priests, religious, and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> went to her for light and counsel. Her charity and compassion, especially toward the afflicted and miserable, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no bounds. Like St. Francis, Mary Frances had a tender devotion to the Infant <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, and the Blessed Virgin. The last thirty-eight years of her life were spent in the house of a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Giovanni Pessiri. She was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the church of the Alcantarines, Sta. Lucia del Monte, at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, which contains the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/08466a.htm">St. John Joseph of the Cross</a>. She was declared Venerable by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, 18 May, 1803, <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, 12 November, 1843, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, 29 June, 1867. Her feast on 6 October is kept by the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> and <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> as a double of the second class, and by the <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a> as a double major.
