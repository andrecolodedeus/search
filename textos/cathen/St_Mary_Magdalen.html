<h1>St. Mary Magdalen</h1>  

<p>Mary Magdalen was so called either from <a href="../cathen/09523a.htm">Magdala</a> near <a href="../cathen/14716a.htm">Tiberias</a>, on the west shore of <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">Galilee</a>, or possibly from a <a href="../cathen/14435b.htm">Talmudic</a> expression meaning "curling <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women's</a> hair," which the <a href="../cathen/14435b.htm">Talmud</a> explains as of an adulteress.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> she is mentioned among the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who accompanied <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and ministered to Him (<a href="../bible/luk008.htm#vrs2">Luke 8:2-3</a>), where it is also said that seven <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> had been <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">cast out</a> of her (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs9">Mark 16:9</a>). She is next named as standing at the foot of the <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a> (<a href="../bible/mar015.htm#vrs40">Mark 15:40</a>; <a href="../bible/mat027.htm#vrs56">Matthew 27:56</a>; <a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs25">John 19:25</a>; <a href="../bible/luk023.htm#vrs49">Luke 23:49</a>). She saw <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> laid in the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">tomb</a>, and she was the first recorded witness of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, as a whole, distinguish the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>: <ul> <li>the "sinner" of <a href="../bible/luk007.htm#vrs36">Luke 7:36-50</a>; <li>the sister of <a href="../cathen/09721b.htm">Martha</a> and <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a>, <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#vrs38">Luke 10:38-42</a> and <a href="../bible/joh011.htm">John 11</a>; and <li>Mary Magdalen. </ul>

<p>On the other hand most of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latins</a> hold that these three were one and the same. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/04497a.htm">critics</a>, however, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> there were two, if not three, distinct <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. It is impossible to demonstrate the identity of the three; but those commentators undoubtedly go too far who assert, as does Westcott (on <a href="../bible/joh011.htm#vrs1">John 11:1</a>), "that the identity of Mary with Mary Magdalene is a mere conjecture supported by no direct evidence, and opposed to the general tenour of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospels</a>." It is the identification of Mary of Bethany with the "sinner" of <a href="../bible/luk007.htm#vrs37">Luke 7:37</a>, which is most combatted by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. It almost seems as if this reluctance to identify the "sinner" with the sister of <a href="../cathen/09721b.htm">Martha</a> were due to a failure to grasp the full significance of the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The harmonizing tendencies of so many modern <a href="../cathen/04497a.htm">critics</a>, too, are responsible for much of the existing confusion.

<p>The first fact, mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> relating to the question under discussion is the anointing of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> feet by a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, a "sinner" in the city (<a href="../bible/luk007.htm#vrs37">Luke 7:37-50</a>). This belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">Galilean</a> ministry, it precedes the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of the feeding of the five thousand and the third <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>. Immediately afterwards <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">St. Luke</a> describes a missionary circuit in <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">Galilee</a> and tells us of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who ministered to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, among them being "Mary who is called Magdalen, out of whom seven <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> were <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">gone forth</a>" (<a href="../bible/luk008.htm#vrs2">Luke 8:2</a>); but he does not tell us that she is to be identified with the "sinner" of the previous chapter. In <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#vrs38">10:38-42</a>, he tells us of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> visit to <a href="../cathen/09721b.htm">Martha</a> and Mary "in a certain town"; it is impossible to identify this town, but it is clear from <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#vrs53">9:53</a>, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had definitively left <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">Galilee</a>, and it is quite possible that this "town" was <a href="../cathen/02531a.htm">Bethany</a>. This seems confirmed by the preceding <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>, which must almost certainly have been spoken on the road between <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. But here again we note that there is no suggestion of an identification of the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> (the "sinner", Mary Magdalen, and Mary of Bethany), and if we had only <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">St. Luke</a> to guide us we should certainly have no grounds for so identifying them. <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">St. John</a>, however, clearly identifies Mary of Bethany with the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who anointed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> feet (<a href="../bible/joh012.htm">12</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/mat026.htm">Matthew 26</a> and <a href="../bible/mar014.htm">Mark 14</a>). It is remarkable that already in <a href="../bible/joh011.htm#vrs2">11:2</a>, <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">St. John</a> has spoken of Mary as "she that anointed the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord's</a> feet", <em>he aleipsasa</em>; It is commonly said that he refers to the subsequent anointing which he himself describes in <a href="../bible/joh012.htm#vrs3">12:3-8</a>; but it may be questioned whether he would have used <em>he aleipsasa</em> if another <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and she a "sinner" in the city, had done the same. It is conceivable that <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">St. John</a>, just because he is writing so long after the event and at a time when Mary was dead, wishes to point out to us that she was really the same as the "sinner." In the same way <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">St. Luke</a> may have veiled her identity precisely because he did not wish to defame one who was yet living; he certainly does something similar in the case of <a href="../cathen/10056b.htm">St. Matthew</a> whose identity with Levi the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs7">5:7</a>) he conceals.

<p>If the foregoing argument holds good, Mary of Bethany and the "sinner" are one and the same. But an examination of <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">St. John's Gospel</a> makes it almost impossible to deny the identity of Mary of Bethany with Mary Magdalen. From <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">St. John</a> we learn the name of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">"woman"</a> who anointed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> feet previous to the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">last supper</a>. We may remark here that it seems unnecessary to hold that because <a href="../cathen/10057a.htm">St. Matthew</a> and <a href="../cathen/09674b.htm">St. Mark</a> say "two days before the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>", while <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">St. John</a> says "six days" there were, therefore, two distinct anointings following one another. <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">St. John</a> does not necessarily mean that the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">supper</a> and the anointing took place six days before, but only that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came to <a href="../cathen/02531a.htm">Bethany</a> six days before the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>. At that <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">supper</a>, then, Mary received the glorious encomium, "she hath wrought a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">work</a> upon Me . . . in pouring this ointment upon My body she hath done it for My burial . . . wheresoever this <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> shall be preached . . . that also which she hath done shall be told for a memory of her." Is it credible, in view of all this, that this Mary should have no place at the foot of the <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a>, nor at the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">tomb of Christ</a>? Yet it is Mary Magdalen who, according to all the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>, stood at the foot of the <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a> and assisted at the entombment and was the first recorded witness of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. And while <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">St. John</a> calls her "Mary Magdalen" in <a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs25">19:25</a>, <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs1">20:1</a>, and <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs18">20:18</a>, he calls her simply "Mary" in <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs11">20:11</a> and <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs16">20:16</a>.

<p>In the view we have advocated the series of events forms a consistent whole; the "sinner" comes early in the ministry to seek for pardon; she is described immediately afterwards as Mary Magdalen "out of whom seven <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> were gone forth"; shortly after, we find her "sitting at the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord's</a> feet and hearing His words." To the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mind it all seems fitting and natural. At a later period Mary and <a href="../cathen/09721b.htm">Martha</a> turn to "the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of the Living God</a>", and He restores to them their brother <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a>; a short time afterwards they make Him a supper and Mary once more repeats the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> she had performed when a penitent. At the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> she stands near by; she sees Him laid in the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">tomb</a>; and she is the first witness of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>--excepting always His <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother</a>, to whom He must needs have appeared first, though the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is silent on this point. In our view, then, there were two anointings of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> feet--it should surely be no difficulty that <a href="../cathen/10057a.htm">St. Matthew</a> and <a href="../cathen/09674b.htm">St. Mark</a> speak of His head--the first (<a href="../bible/luk007.htm">Luke 7</a>) took place at a comparatively early date; the second, two days before the last <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>. But it was one and the same <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who performed this pious <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> on each occasion.
<h2>Subsequent history of St. Mary Magdalen</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> maintains that the saint retired to Ephesus with the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> and there died, that her <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were transferred to Constantinople in 886 and are there preserved. <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> (<em>De miraculis</em>, I, xxx) supports the statement that she went to Ephesus. However, according to a <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> tradition (see <a href="../cathen/09097a.htm">SAINT LAZARUS OF BETHANY</a>), Mary, <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a>, and some companions came to <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> and <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> the whole of Provence. Magdalen is said to have retired to a hill, La Sainte-Baume, near by, where she gave herself up to a life of <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> for thirty years. When the time of her death arrived she was carried by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a> and into the <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratory</a> of St. Maximinus, where she received the <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">viaticum</a>; her body was then <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">laid</a> in an <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratory</a> constructed by St. Maximinus at Villa Lata, afterwards called St. Maximin. <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">History</a> is silent about these <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> till 745, when according to the chronicler <a href="../cathen/13783c.htm">Sigebert</a>, they were removed to V&eacute;zelay through fear of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. No record is preserved of their return, but in 1279, when Charles II, King of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, erected a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at La Sainte-Baume for the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, the shrine was found intact, with an inscription stating why they were hidden. In 1600 the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were placed in a sarcophagus sent by <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, the head being placed in a separate vessel. In 1814 the church of La Sainte-Baume, wrecked during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, was restored, and in 1822 the grotto was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> afresh. The head of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> now lies there, where it has lain so long, and where it has been the centre of so many <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>.
