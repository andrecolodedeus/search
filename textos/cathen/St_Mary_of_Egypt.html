<h1>St. Mary of Egypt</h1>  

<p>Born probably about 344; died about 421. At the early age of twelve Mary left her home and came to <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, where for upwards of seventeen years she led a life of public prostitution. At the end of that time, on the occasion of a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, she embarked for Palestine, not however with the intention of making the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, but in the hope that life on board ship would afford her new and abundant opportunities of gratifying an insatiable <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Arrived in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> she persisted in her shameless life, and on the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross joined the crowds towards the church where the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">sacred relic</a> was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>, hoping to meet in the gathering some new victims whom she might allure into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And now came the turning-point in her career. When she reached the church door, she suddenly felt herself repelled by some secret force, and having vainly attempted three or four times to enter, she retired to a corner of the churchyard, and was struck with remorse for her wicked life, which she recognized as the cause of her exclusion from the church. Bursting into bitter tears and beating her breast, she began to bewail her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Just then her eyes fell upon a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> above the spot where she was standing, and in deep <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> of heart she besought <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> for help, and permission to enter the church and venerate the sacred wood on which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had suffered, promising that if her request were granted, she would then renounce forever the world and its ways, and forthwith depart whithersoever <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> might lead her. Encouraged by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and counting on the mercy of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, she once more approached the door of the church, and this time succeeded in entering without the slightest difficulty. Having adored the Holy Cross and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> the pavement of the church, she returned to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady's</a> <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, and while <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> there for guidance as to her future course, she seemed to hear a voice from afar telling her that if she crossed the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, she would find rest. That same evening Mary reached the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> and received <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> in a church dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">Baptist</a>, and the day following crossed the river and wandered eastward into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> that stretches towards Arabia.

<p>Here she had lived absolutely alone for forty-seven years, subsisting apparently on herbs, when a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, named Zosimus, who after the custom of his brethren had come out from his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to spend <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, met her and learned from her own lips the strange and romantic story of her life. As soon as they met, she called Zosimus by his name and recognized him as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. After they had conversed and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> together, she begged Zosimus to promise to meet her at the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a> evening of the following year and bring with him the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. When the appointed evening arrived, Zosimus, we are told, put into a small <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> a portion of the undefiled Body and the precious Blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a> (P.L. LXXIII, 686; "Mittens in modico calice intemerati corporis portionem et pretiosi sanguinis D.N.J.C." But the reference to both species is less clear in Acta SS., IX, 82: "Accipiens parvum poculum intemerati corporis ac venerandi sanguinis Christi Dei nostri"), and came to the spot that had been indicated. After some time Mary appeared on the eastern bank of the river, and having made the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>, walked upon the waters to the western side. Having received <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, she raised her hands towards <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and cried aloud in the words of Simeon: "Now thou dost dismiss thy servant, O Lord, according to thy word in peace, because my eyes have seen thy <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>". She then charged Zosimus to come in the course of a year to the spot where he had first met her in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, adding that he would find her then in what condition <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> might ordain. He came, but only to find the poor saint's corpse, and written beside it on the ground a request that he should bury her, and a statement that she had died a year before, on the very night on which he had given her <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, far away by the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan's</a> banks. Aided, we are told, by a lion, he prepared her grave and buried her, and having commended himself and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, he returned to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, where now for the first time he recounted the wondrous story of her life.

<p>The saint's life was written not very long after her death by one who states that he learned the details from the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to which Zosimus had belonged. Many authorities mention St. Sophronius, who became <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in 635, as the author; but as the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> give good reasons for <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that the Life was written before 500, we may conclude that it is from some other hand. The date of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> is somewhat uncertain. The <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> place her death on 1 April, 421, while many other authorities put it a century later. The <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> celebrates her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> on 1 April, while the Roman Martyrology assigns it to 2 April, and the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">Calendar</a> to 3 April. The Greek date is more likely to be correct; the others may be due to the fact that on those days portions of her <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> reached the West. <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">Relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> are <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, and some other places.
