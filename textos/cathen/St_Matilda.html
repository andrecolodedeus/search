<h1>St. Matilda</h1>  

<p>Queen of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, wife of King Henry I (The Fowler), born at the Villa of Engern in <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, about 895; died at Quedlinburg, 14 March, 968. She was brought up at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Erfurt. Henry, whose marriage to a young <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, named Hathburg, had been declared invalid, asked for Matilda's hand, and married her in 909 at Walhausen, which he presented to her as a dowry. Matilda became the mother of: <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a>, Emperor of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; Henry, Duke of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>; <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>; Gerberga, who married Louis IV of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; Hedwig, the mother of <a href="../cathen/07515c.htm">Hugh Capet</a>. In 912 Matilda's husband succeeded his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> as Duke of Saxony, and in 918 he was chosen to succeed King Conrad of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. As queen, Matilda was <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, and generous, and was always ready to help the oppressed and unfortunate. She wielded a wholesome influence over the king. After a reign of seventeen years, he died in 936. He bequeathed to her all his possessions in Quedlinburg, Poehlden, Nordhausen, Grona, and Duderstadt.

<p>It was the king's wish that his eldest son, Otto, should succeed him. Matilda wanted her favourite son Henry on the royal throne. On the plea that he was the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> son after his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> became king, she induced a few nobles to cast their vote for him, but Otto was elected and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> king on 8 August, 936. Three years later Henry revolted against his brother Otto, but, being unable to wrest the royal crown from him, submitted, and upon the <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a> of Matilda was made Duke of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. Soon, however, the two brothers joined in persecuting their mother, whom they accused of having impoverished the crown by her lavish <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>. To satisfy them, she renounced the possessions the deceased king had bequeathed to her, and retired to her villa at Engern in <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>. But afterwards, when misfortune overtook her sons, Matilda was called back to the palace, and both Otto and Henry implored her pardon.

<p>Matilda built many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and founded or supported numerous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Her chief foundations were the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at Quedlinburg, Nordhausen, Engern, and Poehlden. She spent many days at these <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and was especially fond of Nordhausen. She died at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of Sts. Servatius and Dionysius at Quedlinburg, and was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> there by the side of her husband. She was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a saint immediately after her death. Her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 14 March.
