<h1>St. Matthew</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>.

<p>The name <em>Matthew</em> is derived from the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>Mattija</em>, being shortened to <em>Mattai</em> in post-Biblical <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">Hebrew</a>. In Greek it is sometimes spelled <em>Maththaios</em>, BD, and sometimes <em>Matthaios</em>, CEKL, but grammarians do not agree as to which of the two spellings is the original.

<p>Matthew is spoken of five times in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>; first in <a href="../bible/mat009.htm#vrs9">Matthew 9:9</a>, when <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">called</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to follow Him, and then four times in the list of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, where he is mentioned in the seventh (<a href="../bible/luk006.htm#vrs15">Luke 6:15</a>, and <a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs18">Mark 3:18</a>), and again in the eighth place (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs3">Matthew 10:3</a>, and <a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs13">Acts 1:13</a>). The man designated in <a href="../bible/mat009.htm#vrs9">Matthew 9:9</a>, as "sitting in the custom house", and "named Matthew" is the same as Levi, recorded in <a href="../bible/mar002.htm#vrs14">Mark 2:14</a>, and <a href="../bible/luk005.htm#vrs27">Luke 5:27</a>, as "sitting at the receipt of custom". The account in the three <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptics</a> is identical, the <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">vocation</a> of Matthew-Levi being alluded to in the same terms. Hence Levi was the original name of the man who was subsequently called Matthew; the <em>Maththaios legomenos</em> of <a href="../bible/mat009.htm#vrs9">Matthew 9:9</a>, would indicate this.

<p>The fact of one man having two names is of frequent occurrence among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> usually bears a <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">Hebrew name</a> such as "Shaoul" and a Greek name, <em>Paulos</em>. However, we have also examples of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> with two <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">Hebrew names</a> as, for instance, <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Joseph-Caiaphas</a>, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon-Cephas</a>, etc. It is probable that Mattija, "gift of Iaveh", was the name conferred upon the tax-gatherer by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> when He <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">called</a> him to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolate</a>, and by it he was thenceforth known among his <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> brethren, Levi being his original name.

<p>Matthew, the son of Alpheus (<a href="../bible/mar002.htm#vrs14">Mark 2:14</a>) was a <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilean</a>, although <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> informs us that he was a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a>. As tax-gatherer at <a href="../cathen/03309a.htm">Capharnaum</a>, he collected custom duties for <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#III">Herod Antipas</a>, and, although a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, was despised by the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> all <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a>. When summoned by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, Matthew arose and followed Him and tendered Him a feast in his house, where tax-gatherers and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinners</a> sat at table with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. This drew forth a protest from the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> rebuked in these consoling words: "I came not to call the just, but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinners</a>".

<p>No further allusion is made to Matthew in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, except in the list of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. As a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> and an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> he thenceforth followed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, accompanying Him up to the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and, in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, was one of the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. He was also amongst the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> who were present at the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>, and afterwards withdrew to an upper chamber, in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> in union with <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, the Mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and with his <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brethren</a> (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs10">Acts 1:10</a> and <a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs14">1:14</a>).

<p>Of Matthew's subsequent career we have only inaccurate or <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">legendary</a> data. <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a> tells us that Matthew preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a>, <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">St. Clement of Alexandria</a> claiming that he did this for fifteen years, and <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> maintains that, before going into other countries, he gave them his <a href="../cathen/10057a.htm">Gospel</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">mother tongue</a>. Ancient writers are not as one as to the countries evangelized by Matthew, but almost all mention Ethiopia to the south of the Caspian Sea (not <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>), and some <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> and the kingdom of the Parthians, <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>.

<p>According to Heracleon, who is quoted by <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, Matthew did not die a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, but this opinion conflicts with all other ancient testimony. Let us add, however, that the account of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> Greek writings entitled "Martyrium S. Matth&aelig;i in Ponto" and published by Bonnet, "Acta apostolorum apocrypha" (Leipzig, 1898), is absolutely devoid of historic value. <a href="../cathen/09280b.htm">Lipsius</a> holds that this "Martyrium S. Matth&aelig;i", which contains traces of <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, must have been published in the third century.

<p>There is a disagreement as to the place of St. Matthew's <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> and the kind of torture inflicted on him, therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> whether he was burned, <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>, or beheaded. The Roman <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">Martyrology</a> simply says: "S. Matth&aelig;i, qui in &AElig;thiopia pr&aelig;dicans martyrium passus est".

<p>Various writings that are now considered <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>, have been attributed to St. Matthew. In the "Evangelia apocrypha" (Leipzig, 1876), Tischendorf reproduced a <a href="../cathen/09023a.htm">Latin</a> document entitled: "De Ortu beat&aelig; Mari&aelig; et infantia Salvatoris", supposedly written in <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> by St. Matthew the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a>, and translated into <a href="../cathen/09023a.htm">Latin</a> by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. It is an abridged adaptation of the "Protoevangelium" of St. James, which was a Greek <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> of the second century. This pseudo-Matthew dates from the middle or the end of the sixth century.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> celebrates the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of St. Matthew on 21 September, and the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> on 16 November. St. Matthew is represented under the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of a winged <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, carrying in his hand a lance as a characteristic emblem.
