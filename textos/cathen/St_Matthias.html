<h1>St. Matthias</h1>  

<p>Apostle.

<p>The Greek <em>Matthias</em> (or, in some <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, <em>Maththias</em>), is a name derived from <em>Mattathias</em>, <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>Mattithiah</em>, signifying "gift of <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a>." Matthias was one of the seventy disciples of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and had been with Him from His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by John to the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a> (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs21">Acts 1:21-22</a>). It is related (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs15">Acts 1:15-26</a>) that in the days following the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>, Peter proposed to the assembled brethren, who numbered one hundred and twenty, that they choose one to fill the place of the traitor <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> in the Apostolate. Two disciples, Joseph, called Barsabas, and Matthias were selected, and lots were drawn, with the result in favour of Matthias, who thus became associated with the eleven Apostles. Zeller has declared this narrative unhistoric, on the plea that the Apostles were in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> after the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. As a matter of fact they did return to <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, but the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> clearly state that about the feast of Pentecost they went back to Jerusalem.

<p>All further information concerning the life and death of Matthias is vague and contradictory. According to Nicephorus (<a href="../fathers/250102.htm"><em>Church History</em> II.40</a>), he first preached the Gospel in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, then in <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> (that is to say, Colchis) and was crucified. The Synopsis of Dorotheus contains this tradition: Matthias in interiore &AElig;thiopia, ubi Hyssus maris portus et Phasis fluvius est, hominibus barbaris et carnivoris praedicavit Evangelium. Mortuus est autem in Sebastopoli, ibique prope templum Solis sepultus (Matthias preached the Gospel to barbarians and cannibals in the interior of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, at the harbour of the sea of Hyssus, at the mouth of the river Phasis. He died at <a href="../cathen/13668c.htm">Sebastopolis</a>, and was buried there, near the Temple of the Sun). Still another tradition maintains that Matthias was stoned at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and then beheaded (cf. <a href="../cathen/14724b.htm">Tillemont</a>, "M&eacute;moires pour servir &agrave; l'histoire eccl. des six premiers si&egrave;cles", I, 406-7). It is said that St. Helena brought the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Matthias to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and that a portion of them was at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. Bollandus* (Acta SS., May, III) <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> if the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> that are in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> are not rather those of the St. Matthias who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> about the year 120, and whose history would seem to have been confounded with that of the Apostle. The <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> celebrates the feast of St. Matthias on 24 February and the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> on 9 August. [<em>Note:</em> After this article was written, the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> moved the feast of St. Matthias to 14 May.]

<p><a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (<a href="../fathers/02103.htm"><em>Stromata</em> III.4</a>) records a sentence that the <a href="../cathen/11067a.htm">Nicolaitans</a> ascribe to Matthias: "we must combat our flesh, set no value upon it, and concede to it nothing that can flatter it, but rather increase the growth of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>". This teaching was probably found in the Gospel of Matthias which was mentioned by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (Hom. i in Lucam); by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.25</a>), who attributes it to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (Praef. in Matth.), and in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of Gelasius (VI, 8) which declares it <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>. It is at the end of the list of the Codex Barrocciamus (206). This Gospel is probably the document whence <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> quoted several passages, saying that they were borrowed from the traditions of Matthias, <em>Paradoseis</em>, the testimony of which he claimed to have been invoked by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> Valentinus, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> (<a href="../fathers/02107.htm"><em>Stromata</em> VII.17</a>). According to the Philosophoumena, VII, 20, <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> quoted <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> discourses, which he attributed to Matthias. These three writings: the gospel, the Traditions, and the Apocryphal Discourses were identified by Zahn (Gesch. des N. T. Kanon, II, 751), but Harnack (Chron. der altchrist. Litteratur, 597) denies this identification. Tischendorf ("Acta apostolorum apocrypha", Leipzig, 1851) published after Thilo, 1846, "Acta Andreae et Matthiae in urbe anthropophagarum", which, according to Lipsius, belonged to the middle of the second century. This apocrypha relates that Matthias went among the cannibals and, being cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, was delivered by Andrew. Needless to say, the entire narrative is without historical value. Moreover, it should be remembered that, in the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> writings, Matthew and Matthias have sometimes been confounded.
