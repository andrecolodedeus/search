<h1>St. Maximinus</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, b. at Silly near <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, d. there, 29 May, 352 or 12 Sept., 349. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by St. Agritius, whom he succeeded as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> in 332 or 335. At that time <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> was the government seat of the Western Emperor and, by force of his office, Maximinus stood in close relation with the Emperors Constantine II and Constans. He was a strenuous defender of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> against <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> and an intimate friend of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>, whom he harboured as an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> guest during his exile of two years and four months (336-8) at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. He likewise received with honours the banished patriarch Paul of Constantinople in 341 and effected his recall to Constantinople. When four <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> came from Antioch to <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> in 342 with the purpose of winning Emperor Constans to their side, Maximinus refused to receive them and induced the emperor to reject their proposals. In conjunction with <a href="../cathen/08561a.htm">Pope Julius I</a> and Bishop <a href="../cathen/07475a.htm">Hosius of Cordova</a>, he persuaded the Emperor Constans to convene the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Synod of Sardica</a> in 343 and probably took part in it. That the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> considered him as one of their chief opponents is evident from the fact that they condemned by name along with <a href="../cathen/08561a.htm">Pope Julius I</a> and <a href="../cathen/07475a.htm">Hosius of Cordova</a> at their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> synod of Philippopolis in 343 (Mans, "Sacrorum Conc. nova et ampl. Coll.", III, 136 sq.). In 345 he took part in the Synod of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and is said to have presided over a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held at Cologne in 346, where Bishop Euphratas of Cologne was deposed on account of his leanings toward <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>. (Concerning the authenticity of the Acts of this synod see the new French translation of Hefele's "Conciliengeschichte", I, ii (Paris, 1907), pp. 830-34.) He also sent Sts. Castor and Lubentius as missionaries to the valleys of the Mosel and the Lahn. It is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether the Maximinus whom the usurper Magnentius sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to Constantinople in the interests of peace is identical with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> (Athanasius, "Apol. ad Const. Imp.", 9). His cult began right after his death. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 29 May, on which day his name stands in the <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede</a>, St. Ado, and others. <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honours</a> him as its patron. In the autumn of 353 his body was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. John near <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, where in the seventh century was founded the famous <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> abbey of St. Maximinus, which flourished till 1802.
