<h1>St. Maximus of Turin</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> writer, b. probably in Rhaetia, about 380; d. shortly after 465. Only two dates are historically established in his life. In 451 he was at the synod of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> where the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> accepted the celebrated letter (<em>epistola dogmatica</em>) of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a>, setting forth the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Incarnation against the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> and <a href="../cathen/05633a.htm">Eutychians</a> (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, "SS. Conc. Coll. Ampl.", VI, 143). Among nineteen subscribers Maximus is the eighth, and since the order was determined by age, Maximus must then have been about seventy years old. The second established date is 465, when he was at the Synod of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, VII, 959, 965 sq.) Here the subscription of Maximus follows immediately after the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a>, showing he was the oldest of the forty-eight <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> present. The approximate time and place of his birth may be surmised from a passage in Sermo 81 (P.L., LVII, 695), where he designates himself as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of three missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in 397 at Anaunia in the Rhaetian Alps. History does not mention him after 465. He is the first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, then a suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. His successor was St. Victor. His name is in the Roman <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> on 25 June, and the city of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honours</a> him as its patron. A life which, however, is entirely unreliable, was written after the eleventh century, and is printed in "Acta SS.", June, VII, 3rd ed., 44-46. It states that a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> one day followed him with an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> intention to a retired <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was wont to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. The cleric suddenly became so thirsty that he implored Maximus for help. A roe happened to pass which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> caused to stop, so that the cleric could partake of its milk. This legend accounts for the fact that St. Maximus is represented in art as pointing at a roe.

<p>He is the author of numerous discourses, first edited by Bruni, and published by order of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> at the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> in 1784 (reprinted in P.L., LVII). These discourses, delivered to the people by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, consist of one hundred and eighteen <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>, one hundred and sixteen sermons, and six treatises (<em>tractatus</em>). Homilies 1-63 are <em>de tempore</em>, i.e. on the seasons of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> year and on the feasts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>; 64-82, <em>de sanctis</em>, i.e. on the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> whose feast was commemorated on the day on which they were delivered; 83-118, <em>de diversis</em>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a>, dogmatical or moral. Sermons 1-55 are <em>de tempore</em>; 56-93, <em>de sanctis</em>; 93-116, <em>de diversis</em>. Three of the treatises are on <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, one against the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Pagans</a>, and one against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The last two are extant only in fragments, and their genuineness is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. The sixth treatise, whose genuineness is also <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, contains short discourses on twenty-three topics taken from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Four Gospels</a>. An appendix contains writings of uncertain authorship; thirty-one sermons, three <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>, and two long epistles addressed to a sick friend. Many writings, however, which Bruni ascribes to Maximus are of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> origin. The discourses are usually very brief, and couched in forcible, though at times over flowery language. Among the many facts of liturgy and history touched on in the discourses are: abstinence during <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> (hom. 44), no <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> or kneeling at <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> during <a href="../cathen/05524d.htm">paschal time</a> (hom. 61), <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> on the Vigil of Pentecost (hom. 62), the synod of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> in 389 at which Jovinianus was condemned (hom. 9), the impending barbarian invasion (hom. 86-92), the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> by the barbarians (hom. 94), various <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a> still prevalent at his time (hom. 16, 100-02), the supremacy of St. Peter (hom. 54, 70, 72, serm. 114). All his discourses manifest his solicitude for the eternal welfare of his flock, and in many he fearlessly rebukes the survivals of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> and defends the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> against the inroads of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.
