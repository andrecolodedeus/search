<h1>St. Mechtilde</h1>  

<p>(MATILDA VON HACKEBORN-WIPPRA).

<p>Benedictine; born in 1240 or 1241 at the ancestral castle of Helfta, near Eisleben, Saxony; died in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Helfta, 19 November, 1298. She belonged to one of the noblest and most powerful Thuringian <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, while here sister was the saintly and illustrious <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> Gertrude von Hackeborn. Some writers have considered that Mechtilde von Hackeborn and Mechtilde von Wippra were two distinct <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but, as the Barons of Hackeborn were also Lords of Wippra, it was customary for members of that <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to take their name indifferently from either, or both of these estates. So fragile was she at birth, that the attendants, fearing she might die unbaptized, hurried her off to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who was just then preparing to say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>. He was a man of great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, and after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> the child, uttered these prophetic words: "What do you fear? This child most certainly will not die, but she will become a saintly religious in whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will work many wonders, and she will end her days in a good old age." When she was seven years old, having been taken by her mother on a visit to her elder sister Gertrude, then a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Rodardsdorf, she became so enamoured of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> that her <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> yielded to her entreaties and, acknowledging the workings of grace, allowed her to enter the alumnate. Here, being highly gifted in mind as well as in body, she made remarkable progress in virtue and learning.

<p>Ten years later (1258) she followed her sister, who, now <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>, had transferred the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to an estate at Helfta given her by her brothers Louis and Albert. As a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>, Mechtilde was soon distinguished for her <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, her fervour, and that extreme amiability which had characterized her from childhood and which, like <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, seemed hereditary in her race. While still very young, she became a valuable helpmate to <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> Gertrude, who entrusted to her direction the alumnate and the choir. Mechtilde was fully equipped for her task when, in 1261, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> committed to her prudent care a child of five who was destined to shed lustre upon the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Helfta. This was that Gertrude who in later generations became known as St. Gertrude the Great. Gifted with a beautiful voice, Mechtilde also possessed a special talent for rendering the solemn and <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">sacred music</a> over which she presided as <em>domna cantrix.</em> All her life she held this office and trained the choir with indefatigable <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. Indeed, Divine praise was the keynote of her life as it is of her book; in this she never tired, despite her continual and severe physical sufferings, so that in His revelations Christ was wont to call her His "nightingale". Richly endowed, naturally and supernaturally, ever gracious, beloved of all who came within the radius of her saintly and charming <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, there is little wonder that this <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloistered</a> virgin should strive to keep hidden her wondrous life. Souls thirsting for consolation or groping for light sought her advice; learned <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> consulted her on spiritual matters. At the beginning of her own mystic life it was from St. Mechtilde that St. Gertrude the Great learnt that the marvellous gifts lavished upon her were from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Only in her fiftieth year did St. Mechtilde learn that the two <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> in whom she had especially confided had noted down the favours granted her, and, moreover, that St. Gertrude had nearly finished a book on the subject. Much troubled at this, she, as usual, first had recourse to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. She had a vision of Christ holding in His hand the book of her revelations, and saying: "All this has been committed to writing by my will and inspiration; and, therefore you have no cause to be troubled about it." He also told her that, as He had been so generous towards her, she must make Him a like return, and that the diffusion of the revelations would cause many to increase in His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; moreover, He wished this book to be called "The Book of Special Grace", because it would prove such to many. When the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> understood that the book would tend to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> glory, she ceased to be troubled, and even corrected the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> herself. Immediately after her death it was made public, and copies were rapidly multiplied, owing chiefly to the widespread influence of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Friars Preachers</a>. <a href="../cathen/02607a.htm">Boccaccio</a> tells how, a few years after the death of Mechtilde, the book of her revelations was brought to Florence and popularized under the title of "La Laude di donna Matelda". It is related that the Florentines were accustomed to repeat daily before their sacred images the praises learned from St. Mechtilde's book. St. Gertrude, to whose devotedness we owe the "Liber Specialis Gratiae" exclaims: "Never has there arisen one like to her in our <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>; nor, alas! I fear, will there ever arise another such!" &#151; little dreaming that her own name would be inseparably linked with that of Mechtilde. With that of St. Gertrude, the body of St. Mechtilde most probably still reposes at Old Helfta thought the exact spot is unknown. Her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept 26 or 27 February in different congregations and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of her order, by special permission of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. (For an account of the general life at Helfta and the estimate of the writings of St. Mechtilde, see <a href="../cathen/06533b.htm">GERTRUDE OF HACKEBORN</a>; <a href="../cathen/06534a.htm">SAINT GERTRUDE THE GREAT</a>.)

<p>There is another <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, inferior certainly to that of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, yet great in itself and worthy of mention here: the homage of a transcendent genius was to be laid at the feet of St. Mechtilde. Critics have long been perplexed as to one of the characters introduced by <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> in his "Purgatorio" under the name of Matelda. After ascending seven terraces of a mountain, on each of which the process of purification is carried on, <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>, in Canto xxvii, hears a voice singing: "Venite, benedicti patris mei"; then later, in Canto xxviii, there appears to him on the opposite bank of the mysterious stream a lady, solitary, beautiful, and gracious. To her <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> addresses himself; she it is who initiates him into secrets, which it is not given to Virgil to penetrate, and it is to her that Beatrice refers <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> in the words: "Entreat Matilda that she teach thee this." Most commentators have identified Matilda with the warrior-Countess of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, the spiritual daughter and dauntless champion of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">St. Gregory VII</a>, but all agree that beyond the name the two have little or nothing in common. She is no Amazon who, at <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante's</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that she may draw nearer to let him understand her song, turns towards him "not otherwise than a virgin that droppeth her modest eyes". In more places than one the revelations granted to the mystics of Helfta seem in turn to have become the inspirations of the Florentine poet. All writers on <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> recognize his <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">indebtedness</a> to St. Augustine, the <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13045c.htm">Richard of St. Victor</a>. These are precisely the writers whose doctrines had been most assimilated by the mystics of Helfta, and thus they would the more appeal to the sympathies of the poet. The city of Florence was among the first to welcome St. Mechtilde's book. Now <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>, like all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> poets, was a child of his age, and could not have been a stranger to a book which was so popular among his fellow-citizens. The "Purgatorio" was finished between 1314 and 1318, or 1319 &#151; just about the time when St. Mechtilde's book was popular. This interpretation is supported by the fact that St. Mechtilde in her "Book of Special Grace" (pt. I, c. xiii) describes the place of purification under the same figure of a seven-terraced mountain. The coincidence of the simile and of the name, Matelda, can scarcely be accidental. For another among many points of resemblance between the two writers compare "Purgatorio", Canto xxxi, where <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> is drawn by Matelda through the mysterious stream with pt. II, c. ii. of the "Liber Specialis Gratiae". The serene atmosphere which seems to cling about the gracious and beautiful songstress, her virgin modesty and simple dignity, all seem to point to the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluse</a> of Helfta rather than to the stern heroine of <a href="../cathen/03298a.htm">Canossa</a>, whose hand was thrice bestowed in marriage. Besides, in politics <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>, as an ardent <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a>, supported the imperial pretensions and he would have been little inclined to sing the praises of the <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscan</a> Countess. The conclusion may therefore be hazarded that this "Donna Matelda" of the "Purgatorio" personifies St. Mechtilde as representing mystic <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>.
