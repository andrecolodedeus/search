<h1>St. Melania (the Younger)</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, about 383; died in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, 31 December, 439. She was a member of the famous <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Valerii. Her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were Publicola and Albina, her paternal grandmother of the same name is known as Melania, Senior. Little is known of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> childhood, but after the time of her marriage, which occurred in her thirteenth year, we have more definite information. Through obedience to her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> she married one of her relatives, Pinianus a patrician. During her married life of seven years she had two children who died young. After their death Melania's inclination toward a <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibate</a> life reasserting itself, she secured her husband's consent and entered upon the path of evangelic perfection, parting little by little with all her wealth. Pinianus, who now assumed a brotherly position toward her, was her companion in all her efforts toward <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. Because of the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> invasions of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, she left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 408, and for two years lived near <a href="../cathen/10216a.htm">Messina</a> in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. Here, their life of a monastic character was shared by some former slaves. In 410 she went to Africa where she and Pinianus lived with her mother for seven years, during which time she grew well acquainted with St. Augustine and his friend Alypius. She devoted herself to <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, especially in her <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, to the foundation of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> of which she became superior, and of a <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> of which Pinianus took charge. In 417, Melania, her mother, and Pinianus went to Palestine by way of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. For a year they lived in a hospice for <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, where she met <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>. She again made generous donations, upon the receipt of money from the sale of her estates in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. About this time she travelled in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, where she visited the principal places of monastic and <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">eremetical</a> life, and upon her return to Jerusalem she lived for twelve years, in a hermitage near the Mount of Olives. Before the death of her mother (431), a new series of monastic foundations had begun. She started with a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> on the Mount of Olives, of which she assumed the maintenance while refusing to be made its superior. After her husband's death she built a <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> for men, then a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and later, a more pretentious church. During this last period (Nov., 436), she went to Constantinople where she aided in the conversion of her <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> uncle, Volusian, ambassador at the Court of Theodosius II, and in the conflict with <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>. An interesting episode in her later life is the journey of the Empress Eudocia, wife of Theodosius, to Jerusalem in 438. Soon after the empress's return Melania died.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> began to venerate her shortly after her death, but she was almost unknown in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> for many years. She has received greater attention since the publication of her life by Cardinal Rampolla (Rome, 1905). In 1908, <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> granted her office to the congregation of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> at Somascha. This may be considered as the beginning of a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> cult, to which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> life and works have entitled her. Melania's life has been shrouded in obscurity nearly up to the present time; many people having wholly or partially confounded her with her grandmother Antonia Melania. The accurate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of her life we owe to the discovery of two <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>; the first, in Latin, was found by Cardinal Rampolla in the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a> in 1884, the second, a Greek biography, is in the Barberini <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. Cardinal Rampolla published both these important discoveries at the Vatican printing-office.
