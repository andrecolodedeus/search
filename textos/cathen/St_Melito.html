<h1>St. Melito</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sardis, prominent <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer in the latter half of the second century. Few details of his life are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. A letter of Polycrates of Ephesus to <a href="../cathen/15408a.htm">Pope Victor</a> about 194 (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.24</a>) states that "Melito the eunuch [this is interpreted "the virgin" by Rufinus in his translation of <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>], whose whole walk was in the Holy Spirit", was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> at Sardis, and had been one of the great authorities in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> who held the Quartodeciman theory. His name is cited also in the "Labyrinth" of <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> as one of the second-century writers who taught the duality of natures in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, speaking of the canon of Melito, quotes <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian's</a> statement that he was esteemed a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> by many of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>.

<p>Of Melito's numerous works almost all have perished, fortunately, <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> has preserved the names of the majority and given a few extracts (<a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.13, IV.26</a>). They are (1) "An Apology for the Christian Faith", appealing to <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a> to examine into the accusations against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and to end the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> (written apparently about 172 or before 177). This is a different work from the Syriac apology attributed to Melito, published in Svriae and English by Cureton from a British Museum <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>. The latter, a vigorous confutation of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> and <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a> addressed to <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus Caesar</a>, seems from internal evidence to be of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> origin, though some authorities have identified it with Melito's <em>Peri aletheias</em>. (2) <em>Peri tou pascha</em>, on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, written probably in 167-8. A fragment cited by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> refers to a dispute that had broken out in Laodicea regarding <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, but does not mention the precise matter in controversy. (3) <em>Eklogai</em>, six books of extracts from the Law and the Prophets concerning Christ and the Faith, the passage cited by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> contains a canon of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. (4) <em>He kleis</em>, for a long time considered to be preserved in the "Melitonis clavis sanctae scripturae", which is now known to be an original Latin compilation of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. (5) <em>Peri ensomatou theou</em>, on the corporeity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of which some Syriac fragments have been preserved. It is referred to by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (In Gen., i, 26) as showing Melito to have been an <a href="../cathen/01558c.htm">Anthropomorphite</a>, the Syriac fragments, however, prove that the author held the opposite <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>.

<p>Fourteen additional works are cited by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>. Anastasius Sinaita in his <em>Hodegos</em> (P.G., LXXXIX) quotes from two other writings: <em>Eis to pathos</em> (on the Passion), and <em>Peri sarkoseos</em> (on the Incarnation), a work in three books, probably written against the <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcionites</a>. Routh (see below) has published four scholia in Greek from a Catena on the Sacrifice of Isaac as typifying the Sacrifice of the Cross, probably taken from a corrupt version of the <em>Eklogai</em>. Four Syriac fragments from works on the Body and Soul, the Cross, and Faith, are apparently compositions of Melito, though often referred to Alexander of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. Many spurious writings have been attributed to Melito in addition to the "Melitonis clavis sanctae scripturae" already mentioned e.g., a "Let ter to Eutrepius, "Catena in Apocalypsin", a manifest <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> compiled after A.D. 1200; "De passione S. Joannis Evangelistae" (probably not earlier than the seventh century), "De transitu Beatae Mariae Virginis" (see Apocrypha in I, 607). Melito's feast is observed on 1 April.
