<h1>St. Mellitus</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and third <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, d. 24 April, 624. He was the leader of the second band of missionaries whom <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> sent from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to join St. Augustine at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> in 601. <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> (Hist. Eccl., II, vii) describes him as of noble birth, and as he is styled <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (Epp. Gregorii, xi, 54, 59), it is thought he may have been <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the Monastery of St. Andrew on the Coelian Hill, to which both <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> and St. Augustine belonged. Several commendatory epistles of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> recommending Mellitus and his companions to various Gallic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have been preserved (Epp., xi, 54-62). With the band he sent also "all things needed for divine worship and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> service, viz. <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> and altar cloths, vestments for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and also <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the holy apostles and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, with many books" (Bede, "Hist. Eccl.", I, 29).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of Mellitus as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by Augustine took place soon after his arrival in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and his first missionary efforts were among the East Saxons. Their king was Sabert, nephew to Ethelbert, King of Kent, and by his support, Mellitus was able to establish his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, the East Saxon capital, and build there the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Paul. On the death of Sabert his sons, who had refused <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, gave permission to their people to worship idols once more. Moreover, on seeing Mellitus celebrating Mass one day, the young princes demanded that he should give them also the white bread which he had been wont to give their father. When the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> answered them that this was impossible until they had received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Christian baptism</a>, he was banished from the kingdom. Mellitus went to Kent, where similar difficulties had ensued upon the death of Ethelbert, and thence retired to Gaul about the year 616.

<p>After an absence of about a year, Mellitus was recalled to Kent by Laurentius, Augustine's successor in the See of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. Matters had improved in that kingdom owing to the conversion of the new king Eadbald, but Mellitus was never able to regain possession of his own See of London. In 619, Laurentius died, and Mellitus was chosen <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in his stead. He appears never to have received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, though he retained the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> for five years-a fact which may account for his not consecrating any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. During this time, he suffered constantly from ill-health. He <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> a church to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Mother of God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of SS. Peter and Paul at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, and legend attributes to him the foundation of the Abbey of St. Peter at <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, but this is almost certainly incorrect. Among the many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> recorded of him is the quelling of a great fire at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> which threatened to destroy the entire city. The saint, although too ill to move, had himself carried to the spot where the fire was raging and, in answer to his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, a strong wind arose which bore the flames southwards away from the city. Mellitus was buried in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of SS. Peter and Paul, afterwards St. Augustine's, Canterbury. Some <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> were preserved in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> in 1298. The most reliable account of his life is that given by <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> in "Hist. Eccl.", I, 29, 30; II, 3-7. Elmham in his "Historia Monasterii S. Augustini Cantuar.", edited by Hardwick, gives many additional details, but the authenticity of these is more than questionable. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is observed on April 24.
