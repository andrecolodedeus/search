<h1>St. Menas</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a> under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, about 295. According to the Greek Acts published with Latin translation in "Analecta Bollandiana", III 258 (Surlus XI 241), Menas, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> by birth, served in the Roman army under the tribune Firmilian. When the army came to Cotyaeus in Phrygia, Menas hearing of the impious edicts issued against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> by the Emperors <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> and <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Maximian</a> left the army, retired to a solitude in the mountains and served <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> vigils and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. During the celebration of a great festival Menas appeared in the midst of the populace in the circus, and fearlessly professed bis <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. He was led before the prefect Pyrrhus, cruelly scourged, put to torture and finally beheaded. His body was brought to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> was soon invoked in many needs and afflictions. The fame of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> wrought, spread far and wide and thousands of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> came to the grave in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Mareotis between Alexandria and the valley of Natron. For centuries Bumma (Karm-Abum-Abu Mina) was a national sanctuary and grew into a large city with costly <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> a holy well, and baths. A beautiful basilica was erected by the Emperor Arcadius. The cult was spread into other countries, perhaps by travelling merchants who <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> him as their patron. As a result of various vicissitudes the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> disputes and the conquest of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> by the Arabians under Omar in 641 the sanctuary was neglected and ultimately forgotten. During 1905 Mgr C.M. Kaufmann of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> led an expedition into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> which made excavations at Bumma. He found in a vast field of ruins, the grave, the well and thermae, the basilica, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, numerous inscriptions on the walls imploring aid through the intercession of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, and thousands of little water pitchers and oil lamps. The rich finds are partly in the Museum of Alexandria and Cairo, and partly in Frankfort and <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>. The monsignor published an official report of his expedition in 1908, "La d&eacute;couverte des Sanctuaires de Menas dans le d&eacute;sert de Mareotis". His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 11 November.

<p>Several <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the name Menas were highly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in the ancient Church about whose identity or diversity much dispute is raised. Delahaye (Anal. Boll., XXIX, 117) comes to the conclusion that Menas of Mareotis, Menas of Cotyaes, and Menas of Constantinople, surnamed <em>Kallikelados</em>, are one and the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, that he was an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> and suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in his native place, that a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> was built over his grave which became one of the great sanctuaries of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, that churches were built in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> at Cotyaeus and Constantinople, and gave rise to local legends.
