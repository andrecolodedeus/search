<h1>St. Methodius of Olympus</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> author, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; died a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, probably in 311. Concerning the life of this first scientific opponent of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> very few reports have been handed down; and even these short accounts present many difficulties. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> has not mentioned him in his "Church History", probably because he opposed various theories of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>. We are indebted to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> for the earliest accounts of him (<a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 83</a>). According to him, Methodius was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11249a.htm">Olympus</a> in Lycia and afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>. But the latter statement is not reliable; no later Greek author knows anything of his being <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>; and according to <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250108.htm"><em>Church History</em> VIII.13</a>), Tyrannio was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> during the <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and died a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>; after the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> Paulinus was elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city. Jerome further states that Methodius suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at the end of the last <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, i.e., under Maximinus Daja (311). Although he then adds, "that some assert", that this may have happened under <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a> and <a href="../cathen/15256b.htm">Valerian</a> at Chalcis, this statement (<em>ut alii affirmant</em>), adduced even by him as uncertain, is not to be accepted. Various attempts have been made to clear up the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> concerning the mention of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> as a subsequent <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> of Methodius; it is possible that he was transported to <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and died there.

<p>Methodius had a very comprehensive <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and was an important <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> as well as a prolific and polished author. Chronologically, his works can only be assigned in a general way to the end of the third and the beginning of the fourth century. He became of special importance in the history of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> literature, in that he successfully combated various <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> views of the great Alexandrian, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>. He particularly attacked his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that man's body at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> is not the same body as he had in life; also his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the world's <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> notions it involved. Nevertheless he recognized the great services of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. Like him, he is strongly influenced by <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> philosophy, and uses to a great extent the allegorical explanation of Scripture. Of his numerous works only one has come down to us complete in a Greek text, viz., the dialogue on virginity, under the title: "Symposium, or on Virginity" (<em>Symposion he peri hagneias</em>) in P.G., XVIII, 27-220. In the dialogue, composed with reference to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> "Banquet", he depicts a festive meal of ten virgins in the garden of Arete (virtue), at which each of the participators extols <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> virginity and its sublime excellence. It concludes with a <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> on Christ as the Bridegroom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Larger fragments are preserved of several other writings in Greek; we know of other works from old versions in Slavonian, though some are abbreviated.

<p>The following works are in the form of dialogue: (1) "On Free Will" (<em>peri tou autexousiou</em>), an important treatise attacking the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> view of the origin of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the freedom of the human will; (2) "On the Resurrection" (<em>Aglaophon he peri tes anastaseos</em>), in which the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that the same body that man has in life will be awakened to incorruptibility at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> is specially put forward in opposition to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>. While large portions of the original Greek text of both these writings are preserved, we have only Slavonian versions of the four following shorter treatises: (3) "De vita", on life and rational action, which exhorts in particular to contentedness in this life and to the hope of the life to come; (4) "De cibis", on the discrimination of foods (among <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>), and on the young cow, which is mentioned in Leviticus, with allegorical explanation of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> food-legislation and the red cow (<a href="../bible/num019.htm">Numbers 19</a>); (5) "De lepra", on Leprosy, to Sistelius, a dialogue between Eubulius (Methodius) and Sistelius on the mystic sense of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> references to <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> (<a href="../bible/lev013.htm">Leviticus 13</a>); (6) "De sanguisuga", on the leech in Proverbs (<a href="../bible/pro030.htm#vrs15">Proverbs 30:15 sq.</a>) and on the text, "the heavens show forth the glory of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (Ps. xviii, 2). Of other writings, no longer extant, Jerome mentions (loc. cit.) a voluminous work against Porphyrius, the Neoplatonist who had published a book against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>; a treatise on the "Pythonissa" directed against <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, commentaries on Genesis and the Canticle of Canticles. By other later authors a work "On the Martyrs", and a dialogue "Xenon" are attributed to Methodius; in the latter he opposes the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> on the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the world. New editions of his works are: P.G., XVIII; Jahn, "S. Methodii opera et S. Methodius platonizans" (Halle, 1865); Bonwetsch, "Methodius von Olympus: I, Schriften" (Leipzig, 1891).
