<h1>St. Michael the Archangel</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> "Who is like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?").

<p>St. Michael is one of the principal <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; his name was the war-cry of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">good angels</a> in the battle fought in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">enemy</a> and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">his followers</a>. Four times his name is recorded in <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>:

<p>(1) <em><a href="../bible/dan010.htm#vrs13">Daniel 10:13 sqq.</a></em>, <a href="../cathen/06330a.htm">Gabriel</a> says to <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, when he asks <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to permit the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to return to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: "The Angel [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">D.V.</a> prince] of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">kingdom of the Persians</a> resisted me . . . and, behold Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me . . . and none is my helper in all these things, but Michael your prince."

<p>(2) <em><a href="../bible/dan012.htm">Daniel 12</a></em>, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angel</a> speaking of the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">end of the world</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> says: "At that time shall Michael rise up, the great prince, who standeth for the children of thy people."

<p>(3) <em>In the <a href="../bible/jud001.htm">Catholic Epistle of St. Jude</a>:</em> "When Michael the Archangel, disputing with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, contended about the body of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>", etc. <a href="../cathen/08542b.htm">St. Jude</a> alludes to an ancient <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> of a dispute between Michael and <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> over the body of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, an account of which is also found in the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> book on the assumption of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> (<a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="../fathers/04123.htm"><em>De Principiis</em> III.2.2</a>). St. Michael concealed the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, however, by disclosing it, tried to seduce the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish people</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of hero-worship. St. Michael also guards the body of <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a>, according to the "Revelation of Moses" ("Apocryphal Gospels", etc., ed. A. Walker, <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>, p. 647).

<p>(4) <em><a href="../bible/rev012.htm#vrs7">Apocalypse 12:7</a></em>, "And there was a great battle in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, Michael and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> fought with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">dragon</a>." <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John</a> speaks of the great conflict at the end of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, which reflects also the battle in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> at the beginning of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. According to the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> there is often question of St. Michael in <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> where his name is not mentioned. They say he was the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherub</a> who stood at the gate of <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a>, "to keep the way of the tree of life" (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#vrs24">Genesis 3:24</a>), the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> through whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> published the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a> to his <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">chosen people</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who stood in the way against <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a> (<a href="../bible/num022.htm#vrs22">Numbers 22:22 sqq.</a>), the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who routed the army of Sennacherib (<a href="../bible/2ki019.htm#vrs35">2 Kings 19:35</a>).

<p>Following these <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptural</a> passages, <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Christian tradition</a> gives to St. Michael four offices: <ul><li>To fight against <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. <li>To rescue the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> from the power of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">enemy</a>, especially at the hour of death. <li>To be the champion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> people, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>; therefore he was the <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">orders of knights</a> during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. <li>To call away from earth and bring <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to <a href="../cathen/08550a.htm">judgment</a> ("signifer S. Michael repraesentet eas in lucam sanctam", Offert. Miss Defunct. "Constituit eum principem super animas suscipiendas", Antiph. off. Cf. <a href="../fathers/02013.htm"><em>The Shepherd of Hermas</em>, Book III, Similitude 8, Chapter 3</a>). </ul>Regarding his rank in the celestial <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> opinions vary; <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> (Hom. de angelis) and other <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, also <a href="../cathen/13402b.htm">Salmeron</a>, <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, etc., place St. Michael over all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; they say he is called "archangel" because he is the prince of the other <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; others (cf. P. Bonaventura, op. cit.) believe that he is the prince of the <a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">seraphim</a>, the first of the nine <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> orders. But, according to <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<a href="../summa/1113.htm#article3">Summa Ia.113.3</a>) he is the prince of the last and lowest choir, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Liturgy</a> seems to follow the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>; it calls him "Princeps militiae coelestis quem honorificant angelorum cives". The <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10611a.htm">Mozarabic</a> <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> places St. Michael even above the Twenty-four Elders. The <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Liturgy</a> styles him <em>Archistrategos</em>, "highest general" (cf. Menaea, 8 Nov. and 6 Sept.).
<h2>Veneration</h2>

<p>It would have been natural to St. Michael, the champion of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish people</a>, to be the champion also of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, giving victory in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> to his clients. The early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, however, regarded some of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> as their military patrons: <a href="../cathen/06453a.htm">St. George</a>, <a href="../cathen/14573a.htm">St. Theodore</a>, <a href="../cathen/04706b.htm">St. Demetrius</a>, <a href="../cathen/13728a.htm">St. Sergius</a>, St. Procopius, St. Mercurius, etc.; but to St. Michael they gave the care of their sick. At the place where he was first <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>, in Phrygia, his prestige as <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> healer obscured his interposition in military affairs. It was from early times the centre of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> cult of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">holy angels</a>, particularly of St. Michael. <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Tradition</a> relates that St. Michael in the earliest ages caused a medicinal spring to spout at Chairotopa near <a href="../cathen/04131a.htm">Colossae</a>, where all the sick who bathed there, invoking the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a> and St. Michael, were cured.

<p>Still more famous are the springs which St. Michael is said to have drawn from the rock at <a href="../cathen/04131a.htm">Colossae</a> (Chonae, the present Khonas, on the Lycus). The <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> directed a stream against the sanctuary of St. Michael to destroy it, but the archangel split the rock by lightning to give a new bed to the stream, and sanctified forever the waters which came from the gorge. The <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greeks</a> claim that this <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">apparition</a> took place about the middle of the first century and celebrate a <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> in commemoration of it on 6 September (Analecta Bolland., VIII, 285-328). Also at Pythia in Bithynia and elsewhere in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia</a> the hot springs were <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to St. Michael.

<p>At Constantinople likewise, St. Michael was the great heavenly physician. His principal sanctuary, the Michaelion, was at Sosthenion, some fifty miles south of Constantinople; there the archangel is said to have <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">appeared</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a>. The sick slept in this <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> at night to wait for a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">manifestation</a> of St. Michael; his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> was kept there 9 June. Another famous <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> was within the walls of the city, at the thermal baths of the Emperor Arcadius; there the <a href="../cathen/14383a.htm">synaxis</a> of the archangel was celebrated 8 November. This <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> spread over the entire <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek Church</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Syrian</a>, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Coptic Churches</a> adopted it also; it is now the principal <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of St. Michael in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Orient</a>. It may have originated in Phrygia, but its station at Constantinople was the Thermae of Arcadius (Martinow, "Annus Graeco-slavicus", 8 Nov.). Other <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feasts</a> of St. Michael at Constantinople were: 27 October, in the "Promotu" church; 18 June, in the Church of St. Julian at the Forum; and 10 December, at Athaea.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Christians of Egypt</a> placed their life-giving river, the Nile, under the protection of St. Michael; they adopted the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> and kept it 12 November; on the twelfth of every month they celebrate a special commemoration of the archangel, but 12 June, when the river commences to rise, they keep as a <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">holiday</a> of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of St. Michael "for the rising of the Nile", <em>euche eis ten symmetron anabasin ton potamion hydaton</em>.

<p>At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the Leonine Sacramentary (sixth century) has the "Natale Basilicae Angeli via Salaria", 30 September; of the five <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Masses</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> three mention St. Michael. The Gelasian Sacramentary (seventh century) gives the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> "S. Michaelis Archangeli", and the Gregorian Sacramentary (eighth century), "Dedicatio Basilionis S. Angeli Michaelis", 29 Sept. A <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> also here adds "via Salaria" (Ebner, "Miss. Rom. Iter Italicum", 127). This <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of the Via Salaria was six miles to the north of the city; in the ninth century it was called <em>Basilica Archangeli in Septimo</em> (<a href="../cathen/01736a.htm">Armellini</a>, "Chiese di Roma", p. 85). It disappeared a thousand years ago. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> also the part of heavenly physician was given to St. Michael. According to an (<a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>?) <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">legend</a> of the tenth century he <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">appeared</a> over the Moles Hadriani (Castel di S. Angelo), in 950, during the <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> which <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> held against the pestilence, putting an end to the plague. <a href="../cathen/02660c.htm">Boniface IV</a> (608-15) built on the Moles Hadriani in honour of him, a <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a>, which was styled <em>St. Michaelis inter nubes (in summitate circi)</em>.

<p>Well known is the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">apparition</a> of St. Michael (a. 494 or 530-40), as related in the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Roman Breviary</a>, 8 May, at his renowned sanctuary on Monte Gargano, where his original <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron</a> in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was restored to him. To his <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a> the <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombards</a> of Sipontum (<a href="../cathen/09588a.htm">Manfredonia</a>) attributed their victory over the <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitans</a>, 8 May, 663. In commemoration of this victory the <a href="../cathen/09588a.htm">church of Sipontum</a> instituted a special <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the archangel, on 8 May, which has spread over the entire <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> and is now called (since the time of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>) "Apparitio S. Michaelis", although it originally did not commemorate the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">apparition</a>, but the victory.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a> St. Michael is the <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron</a> of mariners in his famous sanctuary at <a href="../cathen/10551a.htm">Mont-Saint-Michel</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04455b.htm">Diocese of Coutances</a>. He is said to have <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">appeared</a> there, in 708, to St. Aubert, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Avranches. In <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a> his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> "S. Michaelis in periculo maris" or "in Monte Tumba" was universally celebrated on 18 Oct., the anniversary of the <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedication</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a>, 16 Oct., 710; the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is now confined to the <a href="../cathen/04455b.htm">Diocese of Coutances</a>. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, after its evangelization, St. Michael replaced for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> god Wotan, to whom many mountains were sacred, hence the numerous mountain <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of St. Michael all over <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Roman Office</a> are said to have been composed by <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">St. Rabanus Maurus</a> of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> (d. 856). In <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">art</a> St. Michael is represented as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> warrior, fully armed with helmet, sword, and shield (often the shield bears the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> inscription: Quis ut Deus), standing over the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">dragon</a>, whom he sometimes pierces with a lance. He also holds a pair of scales in which he weighs the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the departed (cf. Rock, "The Church of Our Fathers", III, 160), or the book of life, to show that he takes part in the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> (29 September) in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> was celebrated as a holy day of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, but along with several other <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feasts</a> it was gradually abolished since the eighteenth century (see <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">FEASTS</a>). Michaelmas Day, in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and other countries, is one of the regular quarter-days for settling rents and accounts; but it is no longer remarkable for the hospitality with which it was formerly celebrated. Stubble-geese being esteemed in perfection about this time, most <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> had one dressed on Michaelmas Day. In some <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (Isle of Skye) they had a <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> on this day and baked a cake, called St. Michael's bannock.
