<h1>St. Monica</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">Widow</a>; born of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> at Tagaste, North Africa, in 333; died at <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, near <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in 387.

<p>We are told but little of her childhood. She was married early in life to Patritius who held an official position in <a href="../cathen/14553b.htm">Tagaste</a>. He was a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>, though like so many at that period, his religion was no more than a name; his temper was violent and he appears to have been of dissolute habits. Consequently Monica's married life was far from being a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> one, more especially as Patritius's mother seems to have been of a like disposition with himself. There was of course a gulf between husband and wife; her <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a> and her habits of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> annoyed him, but it is said that he always held her in a sort of reverence. Monica was not the only matron of <a href="../cathen/14553b.htm">Tagaste</a> whose married life was unhappy, but, by her sweetness and patience, she was able to exercise a veritable apostolate amongst the wives and mothers of her native town; they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that she suffered as they did, and her words and example had a proportionate effect.

<p>Three children were born of this marriage, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> the eldest, Navigius the second, and a daughter, Perpetua. Monica had been unable to secure <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> for her children, and her grief was great when <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> fell ill; in her distress she besought Patritius to allow him to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; he agreed, but on the boy's recovery withdrew his consent. All Monica's anxiety now centred in <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>; he was wayward and, as he himself tells us, lazy. He was sent to <a href="../cathen/09512a.htm">Madaura</a> to <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and Monica seems to have literally wrestled with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of her son. A great consolation was vouchsafed her &mdash; in compensation perhaps for all that she was to experience through <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> &mdash; Patritius became a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> had been sent to <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, to prosecute his studies, and here he fell into grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Patritius died very shortly after his reception into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and Monica resolved not to marry again. At <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> had become a <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichean</a> and when on his return home he ventilated certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> propositions she drove him away from her table, but a strange <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> which she had urged her to recall him. It was at this time that she went to see a certain <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, whose name is not given, but who consoled her with the now famous words, "the child of those tears shall never perish." There is no more pathetic story in the annals of the Saints than that of Monica pursuing her wayward son to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, wither he had gone by stealth; when she arrived he had already gone to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, but she followed him. Here she found <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> and through him she ultimately had the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of seeing <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> yield, after seventeen years of resistance. Mother and son spent six months of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> peace at Cassiacum, after which time <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the church of St. John the Baptist at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. Africa claimed them however, and they set out on their journey, stopping at Civit&agrave; Vecchia and at <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>. Here death overtook Monica and the finest pages of his "Confessions" were penned as the result of the emotion <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> then experienced.

<p>St. Monica was buried at <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, and at first seems to have been almost forgotten, though her body was removed during the sixth century to a hidden <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> in the church of St. Aureus. About the thirteenth century, however, the cult of St. Monica began to spread and a <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> in her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> was kept on 4 May. In 1430 <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> ordered the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> to be brought to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> occurred on the way, and the cultus of St. Monica was definitely established. Later the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, Cardinal d'Estouteville, built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and deposited the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Monica in a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> to the left of the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a> of St. Monica however does not seem to have found a place in the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> before the sixteenth century.

<p>In 1850 there was established at Notre Dame de Sion at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> an Association of Christian mothers under the patronage of St. Monica; its object was mutual <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for sons and husbands who had gone astray. This Association was in 1856 raised to the rank of an <a href="../cathen/01692a.htm">archconfraternity</a> and spread rapidly over all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world, branches being established in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, London, <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03035a.htm">Buenos Aires</a>. <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a> had established a similar Confraternity long before.

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">ST. AUGUSTINE, <em>Confession</em>, IX, reprinted in SURIUS. GUALTERUS, Canon Regular of Ostia, who was especially charged with the work of removing the relics from Ostia by Martin V, wrote a life of the saint with an account of the translation. He appended to the life a letter which used to be attributed to St. Augustine but which is undoubtedly spurious; it purports to be written to his sister Perpetua and describes their mother's death. The BOLLANDISTS decide for the contemporary character of the letter whilst denying it to St. Augustine. BARONIUS, <em>Ann. Eccl</em>., ad an. 389; BOUGAUD, <em>Histoire de S. Monique</em>.</p></div>
