<h1>St. Nicetius</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, born in the latter part of the fifth century, exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> unknown; died in 563 or more probably 566. Saint Nicetius was the most important <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the ancient <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">See of Trier</a>, in the era when, after the disorders of the Migrations, <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> supremacy began in what had been Roman Gaul. Considerable detail of the life of this vigorous and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is known from various sources, from letters written either by or to him, from two poems of <a href="../cathen/06149a.htm">Venantius Fortunatus</a> (Poem., Lib. III, ix, X, ed. Leo, in Mon. Germ. Hist.: Auct. antiq., IV (1881), Pt. I, 63-64 sq.) and above all from the statements of his pupil Aredius, later <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>, which have been preserved by <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> (De vitis Patrum, xvii; De Gloria Confessorum, xciii-xciv). Nicetius came from a Gallo-Roman <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; his home was apparently in Auvergne. The Nicetius mentioned by Sidonius Apollinaris (Epist. VIII, vi) may have been a relative. From his youth he devoted himself to <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> and entered a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, where he developed so rapidly in the exercise of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">Christian virtue</a> and in sacred learning that he was made <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. It was while <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> that King Theodoric I (511-34) learned to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and esteem him, Nicetius often remonstrating with him on account of his wrong-doing without, however, any loss of favour. After the death of Bishop Aprunculus of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, an embassy of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and citizens of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> came to the royal court to elect a new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. They desired Saint Gallus, but the king refused his consent. They then selected Abbot Nicetius, whose election was confirmed by Theodoric. About 527 Nicetius set out as the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, accompanied by an escort sent by the king, and while on the journey had opportunity to make known his firmness in the administration of his office.

<p>Trier had suffered terribly during the disorders of the Migrations. One of the first cares of the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was to rebuild the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>, the restoration of which is mentioned by the poet <a href="../cathen/06149a.htm">Venantius Fortunatus</a>. Arch&aelig;ological research has shown, in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, the existence of mason-work belonging to the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> period which may belong to this reconstruction by Nicetius. A fortified castle (<em>castellum</em>) with a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> built by him on the river Moselle is also mentioned by the same poet (Poem., Lib. III, n. xii). The saintly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> devoted himself with great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> to his pastoral <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. He preached daily, opposed vigorously the numerous evils in the moral life both of the higher classes and of the common people, and in so doing did not spare the king and his courtiers. Disregarding threats, he steadfastly fulfilled his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. On account of his misdeeds he <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> King Clotaire I (511-61), who for some time was sole ruler of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> dominions; in return the king exiled the determined <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (560). The king died, however, in the following year, and his son and successor Sigebert, the ruler of Austrasia (561-75), allowed Nicetius to return home. Nicetius took part in several <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>: the synod of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> (535), of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> (549), the second synod of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> (549), the synod of Toul (550) at which he presided, and the synod of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (555).

<p>Nicetius corresponded with ecclesiastical dignitaries of high rank in distant places. Letters are extant that were written to him by Abbot Florianus of Romain-Mo&ucirc;tier (Canton of Vaud, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>), by Bishop Rufus of Octodurum (now Martigny, in the Canton of Valais, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>), and by Archbishop Mappinius of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. The general interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> did not escape his watchful care. He wrote an urgent letter to Emperor Justinian of Constantinople in regard to the emperor's position in the controversies arising from <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a>. Another letter that has been preserved is to Clodosvinda, wife of the Lombard King Alboin, in which he exhorts this princess to do everything possible to bring her husband over to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. In his personal life the saintly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was very ascetic and self-mortifying; he <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> frequently, and while the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who lived with him were at their evening meal he would go, concealed by a hooded cloak, to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in the churches of the city. He founded a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of his own for the training of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The best known of his pupils is the later <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>, Aredius, who was the authority of <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> for the latter's biographical account of Nicetius. Nicetius was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Maximin at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> on 1 October; in the Roman Martyrology his name is placed under 5 December. The genuineness of two treatises ascribed to him is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>: "De Vigiliis servorum Dei" and "De Psalmodi&aelig; Bono".
