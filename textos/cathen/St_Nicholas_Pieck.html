<h1>St. Nicholas Pieck</h1>  

<p>(Also spelled PICK).

<a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friar Minor</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, b. at Gorkum, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, 29 August, 1534; d. at Briel, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, 9 July, 1572. He came of an old and honourable <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, John Pieck and Henriea Clavia, were deeply attached to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the former on several occasions distinguished himself by his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> against the innovations of <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>. Nicholas was sent to college at <a href="../cathen/02625b.htm">Bois-le-Duc</a> ('S Hertogenbosch), and as soon as he had completed his classical studies he received the habit of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in that town. After his profession he was sent to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> to follow the course of study at the celebrated <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> there. Nicholas was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1558 and thenceforth devoted himself to the apostolic ministry. He evangelized the principal towns of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, combating <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> everywhere, strengthening <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and distinguishing himself by his singular <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, modesty, charity, and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. He was of an open disposition, gay and genial, and his whole bearing inspired affection and respect. His superiors, appreciating his fine qualities, appointed him guardian of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Gorkum, his native town.

<p>When this place was threatened by the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>, Nicholas delivered several discourses to his fellow townsmen, forewarning them against the dangerous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>. In particular, he <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by unanswerable arguments the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a>, showing it to be a marvellous extension of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, and he left nothing undone to bring his two brothers back to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> fold. When the citadel of Gorkum was taken by the Watergeuzen, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> detained the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and religious, and confined them in a dark and foul dungeon. (See <a href="../cathen/06651c.htm">THE MARTYRS OF GORKUM</a>.) During the first night the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> vented their rage particularly against Nicholas. Tying about his neck the cord which girded his loins, they first suspended him from a beam and then let him fall heavily to the ground. This torture was prolonged till the cord broke, and the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, seemingly lifeless, fell to the floor. They then applied a burning torch to his ears, forehead, and chin, and forced open his mouth to burn his tongue and palate, either to find out whether he was still alive or in order to torture him. Meanwhile, the two brothers of Nicholas were busy taking steps to obtain the deliverance of the captives. This was promised them only on condition that the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> would renounce the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and, as nothing could make Nicholas and his companions waver in their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, they were taken to Briel, where they all gained the crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Nicholas and his companions were <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a>, 24 November, 1675, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, 29 June, 1867.
