<h1>St. Nicholas of Myra</h1>  

<p>(<em>Also called</em> NICHOLAS OF BARI).

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10661a.htm">Myra</a> in Lycia; died 6 December, 345 or 352. Though he is one of the most popular <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek</a> as well as the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, there is scarcely anything historically certain about him except that he was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10661a.htm">Myra</a> in the fourth century.

<p>Some of the main points in his legend are as follows: He was born at Parara, a city of Lycia in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>; in his youth he made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and Palestine; shortly after his return he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10661a.htm">Myra</a>; cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, he was released after the accession of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine</a>, and was present at the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a>. In 1087 <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> merchants stole his body at <a href="../cathen/10661a.htm">Myra</a>, bringing it to <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>.

<p>The numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> St. Nicholas is said to have wrought, both before and after his death, are outgrowths of a long tradition. There is reason to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> his presence at <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Nicaea</a>, since his name is not mentioned in any of the old lists of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> that attended this <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">council</a>. His cult in the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> is old and especially popular in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. As early as the sixth century <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Emperor Justinian I</a> built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> at Constantinople, and his name occurs in the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a>. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> his cult seems to have begun with the translation of his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> to <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a>, but in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> it began already under <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a>, probably because his wife Theophano was a <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Grecian</a>. Bishop Reginald of Eichstaedt (d. 991) is known to have written a metric, "Vita S. Nicholai." The course of centuries has not lessened his popularity. The following places <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> him as <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron</a>: <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Diocese of Li&egrave;ge</a>; many cities in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>; Campen in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>; <a href="../cathen/04362a.htm">Corfu</a> in <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>; <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>; and <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. He is <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron</a> of mariners, merchants, bakers, travellers, children, etc. His representations in <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a> are as various as his alleged <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, they have the custom of making him the secret purveyor of gifts to children on 6 December, the day on which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> celebrates his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a>; in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and some other countries St. Nicholas has become identified with Santa Claus who distributes gifts to children on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas eve</a>. His <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are still preserved in the church of San Nicola in <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a>; up to the present day an <a href="../cathen/11228d.htm">oily substance</a>, known as <em>Manna di S. Nicola</em>, which is highly valued for its medicinal powers, is said to flow from them.
