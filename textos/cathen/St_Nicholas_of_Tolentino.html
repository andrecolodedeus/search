<h1>St. Nicholas of Tolentino</h1>  

<p>Born at Sant' Angelo, near <a href="../cathen/06043c.htm">Fermo</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a>, about 1246; d. 10 September, 1306. He is depicted in the black habit of the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Hermits of St. Augustine</a> &#151; a star above him or on his breast, a lily, or a crucifix garlanded with lilies, in his hand. Sometimes, instead of the lily, he holds a vial filled with money or bread. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, said to have been called Compagnonus de Guarutti and Amata de Guidiani (these surnames may merely indicate their birth-places), were <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> folk, perhaps gentle born, living content with a small substance. Nicholas was born in response to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, his mother a model of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. He excelled so much in his studies that even before they were over he was made a canon of St. Saviour's church; but hearing a sermon by a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> of St. Augustine upon the text: "Nolite diligere mundum, nec ea quae sunt in mundo, quia mundus transit et concupiscentia ejus", he felt a call to embrace the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. He besought the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> for admittance into his order. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> gave a joyful consent. Even before his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> he was sent to different <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of his order, at <a href="../cathen/12675a.htm">Recanati</a>, <a href="../cathen/09492a.htm">Macerata</a> etc., as a model of generous striving after perfection. He made his profession before he was nineteen. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> he preached with wonderful success, notably at <a href="../cathen/09492a.htm">Tolentino</a>, where he spent his last thirty years and gave a discourse nearly every day. Towards the end diseases tried his patience, but he kept up his <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortifications</a> almost to the hour of death. He possessed an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> meekness, a guileless simplicity, and a tender <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of virginity, which he never stained, guarding it by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and extraordinary <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortifications</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> in 1446; his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 10 September. His <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, at <a href="../cathen/09492a.htm">Tolentino</a>, is held in veneration by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>.
