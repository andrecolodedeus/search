<h1>St. Nilus</h1>  

<p>(<em>Neilos</em>)

<p>Nilus the elder, of Sinai (died c. 430), was one of the many disciples and fervent defenders of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him first as a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, married, with two sons. At this time he was an officer at the Court of Constantinople, and is said to have been one of the Pr&aelig;torian Prefects, who, according to <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> and Constantine's arrangement, were the chief functionaries and heads of all other governors for the four main divisions of the empire. Their authority, however, had already begun to decline by the end of the fourth century.

<p>While <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> was patriarch, before his first exile (398-403), he directed Nilus in the study of Scripture and in works of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> (Nikephoros Kallistos, "hist. Eccl.", XIV, 53, 54). About the year 390 (Tillemont, "M&eacute;moires", XIV, 190-91) or perhaps 404 (<a href="../cathen/01317b.htm">Leo Allatius</a>, "De Nilis", 11-14), Nilus left his wife and one son and took the other, Theodulos, with him to <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a> to be a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. They lived here till about the year 410 (Tillemont, ib., p. 405) when the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Saracens</a>, invading the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, took Theodulos <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Saracens</a> intended to sacrifice him to their gods, but eventually sold him as a slave, so that he came into the possession of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Eleusa in Palestine. The Bishop received Theodulos among his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and made him door-keeper of the church. Meanwhile Nilus, having left his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to find his son, at last met him at Eleusa. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> then <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> them both <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and allowed them to return to Sinai. The mother and the other son had also embraced the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. St. Nilus was certainly alive till the year 430. It is uncertain how soon after that he died. Some writers believe him to have lived till 451 (<a href="../cathen/01317b.htm">Leo Allatius</a>, op. cit., 8-14). The Byzantine <a href="../cathen/10191b.htm">Menology</a> for his feast (12 November) supposes this. On the other hand, none of his works mentions the Council of Ephesus (431) and he seems to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> only the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> troubles; so we have no evidence of his life later than about 430.

<p>From his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Sinai Nilus was a wellknown <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> throughout the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>; by his writings and correspondence he played an important part in the history of his time. He was known as a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, Biblical scholar and <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetic</a> writer, so people of all kinds, from the emperor down, wrote to consult him. His numerous works, including a multitude of letters, consist of denunciations of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>, abuses of discipline and crimes, of rules and principles of asceticism, especially maxims about the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. He warns and threatens people in high places, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, governors and princes, even the emperor himself, without fear. He kept up a correspondence with Gaina, a leader of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>, endeavouring to convert him from <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> (Book I of his letters, nos. 70, 79, 114, 115, 116, 205, 206, 286); he denounced vigorously the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> both to the Emperor Arcadius (ib., II, 265; III, 279) and to his courtiers (I, 309; III, 199).

<p>Nilus must be counted as one of the leading <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetic</a> writers of the fifth century. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 12 November in the Byzantine Calendar; he is commemorated also in the Roman <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> on the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> remember him, with other <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> fathers, on the Thursday after the third <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of their <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> (<a href="../cathen/11078a.htm">Nilles</a>, "Kalendarium Manuale", Innsbruck, 1897, II, 624).

<p>The writings of St. Nilus of Sinai were first edited by Possinus (Paris, 1639); in 1673 Francisco Su&aacute;rez published a supplement at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; his letters were collected by Possinus (Paris, 1657), a larger collection was made by <a href="../cathen/01317b.htm">Leo Allatius</a> (Rome, 1668). All these editions are used in P.G., LXXIX. The works are divided by <a href="../cathen/06051a.htm">Fessler</a>-Jungmann into four classes: <ul><li>(1) Works about virtues and vices in general: &mdash; "Peristeria" (P.G., LXXIX, 811-968), a treatise in three parts addressed to a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Agathios; "On Prayer" (<em>peri proseuches</em>, ib., 1165-1200); "Of the eight spirits of wickedness" (<em>peri ton th'pneumaton tes ponerias</em>, ib., 1145-64); "Of the vice opposed to virtues" (<em>peri tes antizygous ton areton kakias</em>, ib., 1140-44); "Of various bad thoughts" (<em>peri diapsoron poneron logismon</em>, ib., 1200-1234); "On the word of the Gospel of Luke", xxii, 36 (ib., 1263-1280). <li>(2) "Works about the monastic life": &mdash; Concerning the slaughter of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> on <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a>, in seven parts, telling the story of the author's life at Sinai, the invasion of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Saracens</a>, captivity of his son, etc. (ib., 590-694); Concerning Albianos, a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Nitrian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> whose life is held up as an example (ib., 695-712); "Of Asceticism" (<em>Logos asketikos</em>, about the monastic ideal, ib., 719-810); "Of voluntary poverty" (<em>peri aktemosynes</em>, ib., 968-1060); "Of the superiority of monks" (ib., 1061-1094); "To Eulogios the monk" (ib., 1093-1140). <li>(3) "Admonitions" (<em>Gnomai</em>) or "Chapters" (<em>kephalaia</em>), about 200 <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> drawn up in short maxims (ib., 1239-62). These are probably made by his disciples from his discourses. <li>(4) "Letters": &mdash; Possinus published 355, <a href="../cathen/01317b.htm">Allatius</a> 1061 letters, divided into four books (P.G., LXXIX, 81-585). Many are not complete, several overlap, or are not really letters but excerpts from Nilus' works; some are spurious. <a href="../cathen/06051a.htm">Fessler</a>-<a href="../cathen/08566b.htm">Jungmann</a> divides them into classes, as dogmatic, <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a>, moral, and ascetic. Certain works wrongly attributed to Nilus are named in <a href="../cathen/06051a.htm">Fessler</a>-<a href="../cathen/08566b.htm">Jungmann</a>, pp. 125-6.</ul>
