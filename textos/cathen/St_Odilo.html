<h1>St. Odilo</h1>  

<p>Fifth <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny (q.v.), v.c. 962; d. 31 December, 1048. He was descended from the nobility of Auvergne. He early became a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of St. Julien in Brioude. In 991 he entered Cluny and before the end of his year of probation was made coadjutor to Abbot Mayeul, and shortly before the latter's death (994) was made <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and received <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>. The rapid development of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> under him was due chiefly to his gentleness and charity, his activity and talent for organizing. He was a man of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and penance, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the observance of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, and the monastic spirit. He encouraged learning in his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and had the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="../cathen/06574b.htm">Radolphus Glaber</a> write a history of the time. He erected a magnificent <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> building, and furthered the reform of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Under Alphonse VI it spread into <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">rule of St. Benedict</a> was substituted in Cluny for the domestic rule of Isidore. By bringing the reformed or newly founded <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> into permanent dependence on the mother-house, Odilo prepared the way for the union of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, which Hugo established for maintaining order and discipline. The number of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> increased from thirty-seven to sixty-five, of which five were newly established and twenty-three had followed the reform movement. Some of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> reformed by Cluny, reformed <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>; thus the Abbey of St. Vannes in Lorraine reformed many on the Franco-German borderland. On account of his services in the reform Odilo was called by <a href="../cathen/06312a.htm">Fulbert of Chartres</a> the "Archangel of the Monks", and through his relations with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, rulers, and prominent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the time Cluny monasticism was promoted. He journeyed nine times to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and took part in several <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> there. <a href="../cathen/08429b.htm">John XIX</a> and <a href="../cathen/02429a.htm">Benedict IX</a> both offered him the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> but he declined. From 998 he gained influence with the Emperor <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a>. He was on terms of intimacy with Henry II when the latter, on political grounds, sought to impair the spiritual independence of the German <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the Cluny policy had no permanent success, as the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> there were more inclined to <a href="../cathen/07761a.htm">individualism</a>. Between 1027 and 1046 the relations between the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and the emperor remained unchanged. In 1046 Odilo was present at the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of Henry III in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Robert II of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> allied himself with the Reform party.

<p>The conclusion of the <a href="../cathen/15068a.htm">Peace of God</a> (Treuga Dei), for which Odilo had worked from 1041, was of great <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> importance. During the great famines of that time (Particularly 1028-33), he also exercised his active charity and saved thousands from death.

<p>He established All Souls Day (2 November) in Cluny and its <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> (probably not in 998 but after 1030, and it was soon adopted in the whole church. Of his writings we have but a few short and unimportant ones: a life of the holy Empress St. Adelaide to whom he was closely related; a short biography of his predecessor Mayeul; sermons on feasts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> year; some <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>; and a few letters from his extensive correspondence.

<p>Odilo and his confreres interested themselves in the church reform which began about that time. They followed no definite ecclesiastico-political programme, but directed their attacks principally against individual offences such as <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>, marriage of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the uncanonical marriage of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> could depend above all on the religious of Cluny when it sought to raise itself from its humiliating position and undertook the reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>He died while on a visitation to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Souvigny where he was buried and soon <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a saint. In 1063 Peter Damien undertook the process of his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>, and wrote a short life, an abstract from the work of Jotsald, one of Odilo's <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who accompanied him on his travels. In 1793 the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> together with those of Mayeul were burned by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">revolutionaries</a> "on the altar of the fatherland". The feast of St. Odilo was formerly 2 January, in Cluny, now it is celebrated on 19 January, and in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> on 6 February.
