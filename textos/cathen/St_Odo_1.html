<h1>St. Odo</h1>  

<p>(Oda)</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, d. 2 June, 959 (not in 958; recent researches showing that he was living on 17 May, 959). According to the nearly contemporary account of him in the anonymous "Life of St. Oswald' (op. cit. inf.) his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, a Dane, did not strive to serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even endeavouring to hinder his son's constant presence at the church. Later writers represent Odo's <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> as <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> and the boy himself becoming a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> despite his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Odo was adopted by &AElig;thelhelm, a nobleman, who regarded him with paternal affection and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> him for the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> he accompanied &AElig;thelhelm to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and on the way cured him when he fell ill, by blessing a cup of wine and causing him to drink therefrom. On his return, according to the same writer, he was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of a city in the province of Wilton, so that he has been described as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Wilton, he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> being placed in 920. There is no evidence for this date, and if he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Archbishop Wulfhelm, as is stated, it could not have been before 923. There is a further difficulty as to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> called Wilton. In 927 he was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ramsbury, which being in Wiltshire might loosely be described as the <a href="../cathen/15647b.htm">Diocese of Wilton</a>. But Eadmer states he was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sherborne, and there is an extant document (Cartm Saxonm 666) which lends some support to his statement. If it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, he must have filled the See of Sherborne between &AElig;thelbald and Sigehelm. As the latter was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 925 this only allows two years for a possible episcopate of Odo. At the court of Athelstan (925-940) he was highly esteemed, and the king chose him to accompany abroad his nephew Lewis, whom the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> nobles had recently elected as their king. In 937 he accompanied Athelstan to the battle of Brunanburh, where the incident occurred of his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> restoration, at a critical moment, of the king's lost sword. The story, given by Eadmer, is not mentioned by the earlier anonymous writer. When Archbishop Wulfhelm died in 942, King Eadmund wished Odo to succeed, but he refused, because he was not a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> as previous <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> had been. Finally he accepted the election, but only after he had obtained the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> habit from the Abbey of Fleury. One of his first acts as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was to repair his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, and it is recorded that during the three years that the works were in progress, no storm of wind or rain made itself felt within the precincts. The constitutions which he published as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, "Concil", XVIII; <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., CXXXIII) relate to the <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a> of the church (cap. i), the respective <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of secular princes, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> (ii-vi), the prohibition of unlawful <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, the preservation of concord, the practice of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and almsdeeds, and the payments of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> (vii-x). A synodal letter to his sufragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and an introduction to the life of St. Wilfred, written by him, have also been preserved. Throughout the reign of Eadred (946-955) he supported <a href="../cathen/05199a.htm">St. Dunstan</a>, whom he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, prophetically hailing him as future <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. On the death of Eadred he <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> <a href="../cathen/05324a.htm">Eadwig</a> as king. Shortly after the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> insisted on <a href="../cathen/05324a.htm">Eadwig</a> dissolving his incest connection with &AElig;lgifu and obtained her banishment. In 959 during the reign of Eadgar, whom he had <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> king, realizing the approach of death, he sent for his nephew, St. Oswald, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, but died before his arrival. He was succeeded by the <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> &AElig;lfsige who insulted his memory, and whose speedy death was regarded by the people as the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The next <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/05199a.htm">St. Dunstan</a>, held St. Odo in special veneration, would never pass his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> without stopping to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> there, and first gave him the title of "the Good". The story which represents Odo as having in early manhood followed the profession of arms is only found in later writers such as <a href="../cathen/15633d.htm">William of Malmesbury</a>. Even if it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that Odo served Edward the Elder under arms, there is no reason to suppose, with the writer in the "Dictionary of National Biography", that he did so after he became a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> bore witness to his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> during his life and after his death.
