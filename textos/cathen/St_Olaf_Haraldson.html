<h1>St. Olaf Haraldson</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a> and King of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> (1015-30), b. 995; d. 29 July, 1030. He was a son of King Harald Grenske of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>. According to Snorre, he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in 998 in <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, but more probably about 1010 in <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, by Archbishop Robert. In his early youth he went as a viking to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where he partook in many battles and became earnestly interested in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. After many difficulties he was elected King of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, and made it his object to extirpate <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a> and make the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> the basis of his kingdom. He is the great <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norwegian</a> legislator for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and like his ancestor (Olaf Trygvesson), made frequent severe attacks on the old <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and customs, demolishing the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> and building <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> churches in their place. He brought many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, as King Saint Cnut later did to <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. Some few are known by name (Grimkel, Sigfrid, Rudolf, Bernhard). He seems on the whole to have taken the Anglo-Saxon conditions as a model for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization of his kingdom. But at last the exasperation against him got so strong that the mighty clans rose in rebellion against him and applied to King Cnut of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> for help. This was willingly given, whereupon Olaf was expelled and Cnut elected King of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>. It must be remembered that the resentment against Olaf was due not alone to his <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, but also in a high degree to his unflinching struggle against the old constitution of shires and for the unity of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>. He is thus regarded by the <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norwegians</a> of our days as the great champion of national independence, and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> alike may find in Saint Olaf their great <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>.

<p>After two years' exile he returned to <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> with an army and met his rebellious subjects at Stiklestad, where the celebrated battle took place 29 July, 1030. Neither King Cnut nor the Danes took part at that battle. King Olaf fought with great <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, but was mortally wounded and fell on the battlefield, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> "God help me". Many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> occurrences are related in connection with his death and his disinterment a year later, after <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> had spread widely. His friends, Bishop Grimkel and Earl Einar Tambeskjelver, laid the corpse in a coffin and set it on the high-altar in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Clement in Nidaros (now Trondhjem). Olaf has since been held as a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, not only by the people of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, but also by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His cult spread widely in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, not only in <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, but also in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and Sweden; even in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, there is on Hart Street a St. Olave's Church, long dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> King of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>. In 1856 a fine St. Olave's Church was erected in Christiania, the capital of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, where a large <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of St. Olaf (a donation from the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> Royal Museum) is preserved and <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>. The arms of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> are a lion with the battle-axe of St. Olaf in the forepaws.
