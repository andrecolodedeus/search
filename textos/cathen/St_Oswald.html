<h1>St. Oswald</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, d. on 29 February, 992. Of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> parentage, Oswald was brought up by his uncle Odo, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, and instructed by Fridegode. For some time he was dean of the house of the secular canons at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, but led by the desire of a stricter life he entered the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Monastery of Fleury, where Odo himself had received the monastic habit. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> there and in 959 returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> betaking himself to his kinsman Oskytel, then <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>. He took an active part in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs at York until <a href="../cathen/05199a.htm">St. Dunstan</a> procured his appointment to the <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">See of Worcester</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/05199a.htm">St. Dunstan</a> in 962. Oswald was an ardent supporter of <a href="../cathen/05199a.htm">Dunstan</a> in his efforts to purify the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from abuses, and aided by King Edgar he carried out his policy of replacing by communities the canons who held monastic possessions. Edgar gave the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/13329a.htm">St. Albans</a>, <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>, and Benfleet to Oswald, who established <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> at Westbury (983), Pershore (984), at Winchelcumbe (985), and at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, and re-established Ripon. But his most famous foundation was that of Ramsey in Huntingdonshire, the church of which was dedicated in 974, and again after an accident in 991. In 972 by the joint action of <a href="../cathen/05199a.htm">St. Dunstan</a> and Edgar, Oswald was made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, and journeyed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to receive the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> from <a href="../cathen/08427a.htm">John XIII</a>. He retained, however, with the sanction of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> where he frequently resided in order to foster his monastic reforms (Eadmer, 203). On Edgar's death in 975, his work, hitherto so successful, received a severe check at the hands of Elfhere, King of Mercia, who broke up many communities. Ramsey, however, was spared, owing to the powerful patronage of Ethelwin, Earl of East Anglia. Whilst <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, Oswald collected from the ruins of Ripon the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, some of which were conveyed to <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>. He died in the act of washing the feet of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, as was his daily custom during <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, and was buried in the Church of St. Mary at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>. Oswald used a gentler policy than his colleague <a href="../cathen/05555b.htm">Ethelwold</a> and always refrained from violent measures. He greatly valued and promoted learning amongst the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and induced many scholars to come from Fleury. He wrote two treatises and some synodal decrees. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 28 February.
