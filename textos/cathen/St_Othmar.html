<h1>St. Othmar</h1>  

<p>(Audomar.)

<p>Died 16 Nov., 759, on the island of Werd in the Rhine, near Echnez, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. He was of Alemannic descent, received his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in Rhaetia, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and for a time presided over a <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Florinus in Rhaetia. This church was probably identical with the one of St. Peter at Remus, where St. Florinus had laboured as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and was buried. In 720 Waltram of Thurgau appointed Othmar superior over the cell of St. Gall. He united into a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> that lived about the cell of St. Gall, according to the rule of St. Columban, and became their first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. He added a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; during his abbacy the Rule of St. Columban was replaced by that of St. Benedict. When Karlmann renounced his throne in 747, he visited Othmar at St. Gall and gave him a letter to his brother Pepin, recommending Othmar and his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to the king's liberality. Othmar personally brought the letter to Pepin, and was kindly received. When the Counts Warin and Ruodhart <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> tried to gain possession of some <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> belonging to St. Gall, Othmar fearlessly resisted their demands. Hereupon they captured him while he was on a journey to <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, and held him <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, first at the castle of Bodmann, then on the island of Werd in the Rhine. At the latter place he died, after an <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of six months, and was buried. In 769 his body was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Gall and in 867 he was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> entombed in the new church of St. Othmar at St. Gall. His cult began to spread soon after his death, and now he is, next to <a href="../cathen/10068c.htm">St. Maurice</a> and St. Gall, the most popular saint in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 16 November. He is represented in art as a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, generally holding a little barrel in his hand, an allusion to the alleged <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, that a barrel of St. Othmar never became empty, no matter how much he took from it to give to the poor.
