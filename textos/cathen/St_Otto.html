<h1>St. Otto</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, b. about 1060; d. 30 June, 1139. He belonged to the noble, though not wealthy, <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Mistelbach in Swabia, not to the Counts of Andechs. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but where he was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> is not known. While still young he joined the household of Duke Wladislaw of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>; in 1090 he entered the service of <a href="../cathen/07230a.htm">Emperor Henry IV</a>, and about 1101 was made chancellor. In 1102 the emperor appointed and invested him as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/08084c.htm">conflict of investitures</a> he sided chiefly in political matters with Henry IV, although he avoided taking sides openly. He refused to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Through ambassadors he declared his loyalty to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In 1105 he joined the party of Henry V, went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and there on 13 May, 1106, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He never became a partisan. In 1110-11 he accompanied Henry on his journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but, like other noble characters, he disapproved of the disgraceful treatment of Pope Paschal. This is clear from the fact that he received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on 15 April, 1111. When the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> broke out again, he did not <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> Henry V, and in consequence was suspended by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> party at the Synod in Fritzlar in 1118. At the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> in 1121 he strove hard for peace, which was concluded in 1122 at Worms. Meanwhile he had devoted himself entirely to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had led a model, simple, and even a poor life. He increased the possessions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by new acquisitions, recovered alienated dependencies, completed the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, improved the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, built castles and churches. In particular he favoured the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and founded over twenty <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a>, <a href="../cathen/05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;tt</a>, Halberstadt and <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>. He reformed other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Thus he merited the name of "Father of the Monks".

<p>His greatest service was his missionary work among the Pomeranians. In the Peace with <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> in 1120 the latter had engaged to adopt <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Attempts to convert them through Polish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and through an Italian Bishop, Bernard, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> futile. Duke Boleslaus III then appealed to Otto, and it is due to Otto that the undertaking partook of a German character. Through an understanding with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who appointed him <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, the emperor and the princes, he started in May, 1124, and travelled through Prague, <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, Posen, and Gnesen in East <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>, was received by the duke with great respect, and won over the people through his quiet yet firm attitude, his magnificent appearance, generous donations, and gentle, inspiring sermons. He converted Pyritz, Kammin, Stettin, Julin, and in nine places established eleven churches; 22,165 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. In 1125 he returned to Bamberg. As <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> customs began to assert themselves again, he once more journeyed to <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a> through Magdeburg and Havelberg about the year 1128. In the Diet of Usedom he gained over through his inspiring discourses all the nobles of the land to <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. He then converted new communities, and led back those who had fallen away. Even after his return (in the same year) he was in constant communication with the Pomeranians and sent them <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>. His wish to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a> was not fulfilled as the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> and Gnesen claimed the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. Only in 1140 was his former companion Adalbert confirmed as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Julin. In 1188 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> was removed to Hammin and made directly subject to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In Bamberg he once more gave himself up to his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and prince and performed them with great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. He kept out of all political turmoil. In the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of 1130-31 he tried to remain neutral. The active, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, clever <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was greatly esteemed by the other princes and by Emperor Lothair. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Michael in <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>. Bishop Embrice of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> delivered the funeral oration and applied to Otto the words of Jeremias: "The Lord called thy name, a plentiful olive tree, fair, fruitful, and beautiful." On his mission journey he is reported to have worked many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Many happened also at his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. In 1189 Otto was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/04018a.htm">Clement III</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 30 September, partly also on 30 June; in <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a> on 1 October.
