<h1>St. Pachomius</h1>  

<p>Died about 346. The main facts of his life will be found in <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">MONASTICISM</a> (Section II: <em>Eastern Monasticism before Chalcedon</em>). Having spent some time with Palemon, he went to a deserted village named Tabennisi, not necessarily with the intention of remaining there permanently. A <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> would often withdraw for a time to some more remote spot in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and afterwards return to his old abode. But Pachomius never returned; a vision bade him stay and erect a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>; "very many eager to embrace the monastic life will come hither to thee". Although from the first Pachomius seems to have realized his mission to substitute the cenobitical for the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">eremitical</a> life, some time elapsed before he could realize his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. First his elder brother joined him, then others, but all were bent upon pursuing the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">eremitical</a> life with some modifications proposed by Pachomius (e.g., meals in common). Soon, however, disciples came who were able to enter into his plans. In his treatment of these earliest recruits Pachomius displayed great wisdom. He realized that men, acquainted only with the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">eremitical</a> life, might speedily become disgusted, if the distracting cares of the cenobitical life were thrust too abruptly upon them. He therefore allowed them to devote their whole time to spiritual exercises, undertaking himself all the burdensome work which community life entails. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Tabennisi, though several times enlarged, soon became too small and a second was founded at Pabau (Faou). A <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Chenoboskion (Schenisit) next joined the order, and, before Pachomius died, there were nine <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of his order for men, and two for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.

<p>How did Pachomius get his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the cenobitical life? Weingarten (Der Ursprung des M&ouml;ncthums, Gotha, 1877) held that Pachomius was once a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, on the ground that Pachomius after his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> took up his abode in a building which old people said had once been a <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of Serapis. In 1898 Ladeuze (Le C&eacute;nobitisme pakhomien, 156) declared this theory rejected by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> alike. In 1903 Preuschen published a monograph (M&ouml;ncthum und Serapiskult, Giessen, 1903), which his reviewer in the "Theologische Literaturzeitung" (1904, col. 79), and Abbot Butler in the "Journal of Theological Studies" (V, 152) hoped would put an end to this theory. Preuschen showed that the supposed <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Serapis were not <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in any sense whatever. They were dwellers in the temple who practised "incubation", i.e. sleeping in the temple to obtain oracular dreams. But theories of this kind die hard. Mr. Flinders Petrie in his "Egypt in Israel" (published by the Soc. for the Prop. of Christ. Knowl., 1911) proclaims Pachomius simply a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Serapis. Another theory is that Pachomius's relations with the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> became strained, and that he recoiled from their extreme austerities. This theory also topples over when confronted with facts. Pachomius's relations were always affectionate with the old <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> Palemon, who helped him to build his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. There was never any rivalry between the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> and the cenobites. Pachomius wished his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to emulate the austerities of the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a>; he drew up a rule which made things easier for the less proficient, but did not check the most extreme asceticism in the more proficient. Common meals were provided, but those who wished to absent themselves from them were encouraged to do so, and bread, salt, and water were placed in their cells. It seems that Pachomius found the solitude of the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">eremitical</a> life a bar to vocations, and held the cenobitical life to be in itself the higher (Ladeuze, op. cit., 168). The main features of Pachomius's rule are described in the article already referred to, but a few words may be said about the rule supposed to have been dictated by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> (Palladius, "Hist. Lausiaca", ed. Butler, pp. 88 sqq.), of which use is often made in describing a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Pachomian <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. According to Ladeuze (263 sqq.), all accounts of this rule go back to <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a>; and in some most important points it can be shown that it was never followed by either Pachomius or his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. It is unnecessary to discuss the charges brought by Amelineau on the flimsiest grounds against the morality of the Pachomian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. They have been amply refuted by Ladeuze and Schiwietz (cf. also Leipoldt, "Schneute von Atripe", 147).
