<h1>St. Pantaleon</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a>, died about 305. According to legend he was the son of a <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">rich</a> <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>, Eustorgius of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, and had been instructed in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by his <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> mother, Eubula. Afterwards he became estranged from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. He studied <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a> and became physician to the <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Emperor Maximinianus</a>. He was won back to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Hermolaus. Upon the death of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> he came into possession of a large fortune. Envious colleagues denounced him to the emperor during the <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. The emperor wished to save him and sought to persuade him to apostasy. Pantaleon, however, openly confessed his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that Christ is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">true God</a>, he healed a paralytic. Notwithstanding this, he was condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> by the emperor, who regarded the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> as an exhibition of magic. According to legend, Pantaleon's flesh was first burned with torches; upon this Christ appeared to all in the form of Hermolaus to strengthen and heal Pantaleon. The torches were extinguished. After this, when a bath of liquid lead was prepared, Christ in the same form stepped into the cauldron with him, the fire went out and the lead became cold. He was now thrown into the sea, but the stone with which he was loaded floated. He was thrown to the wild beasts but these fawned upon him and could not be forced away until he had blessed them. He was bound on the wheel, but the ropes snapped, and the wheel broke. An attempt was made to behead him, but the sword bent, and the executioners were converted. Pantaleon implored <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> to forgive them, for which reason he also received the name of Panteleemon (the all-compassionate). It was not until he himself desired it that it was possible to behead him.

<p>The lives containing these legendary features are all late in date and valueless. Yet the fact of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> itself seems to be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by a veneration for which there is early testimony, among others from Theodoret (Graecarum affectionum curatio, Sermo VIII, "De martyribus", in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G., LXXXIII 1033), <a href="../cathen/12450a.htm">Procopius of Caesarea</a> (De aedificiis Justiniani I, ix; V, ix), and the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum" (Acta SS., Nov., II, 1, 97). Pantaleon is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the East as a great <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> and wonderworker. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> he came to be regarded as the <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of physicians and midwives, and became one of the fourteen guardian <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. From early times a phial containing some of his blood has been preserved at Constantinople. On the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> the blood is said to become fluid and to bubble. <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">Relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> are to be found at St. Denis at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; his head is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a> is 27 July, also 28 July, and 18 February.
