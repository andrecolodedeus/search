<div id="springfield2">
<h1>St. Patrick</h1>  

<p>Apostle of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, born at Kilpatrick, near Dumbarton, in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, in the year 387; died at Saul, Downpatrick, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 17 March, 493. <span class="stiki">Some sources say 460 or 461. --<em>Ed.</em></span>

<p>He had for his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> Calphurnius and Conchessa. The former belonged to a Roman <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of high rank and held the office of <em>decurio</em> in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> or <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">Britain</a>. Conchessa was a near relative of the great <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron</a> of <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>. Kilpatrick still retains many memorials of Saint Patrick, and frequent <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> continued far into the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> to perpetuate there the fame of his <a href="../cathen/13428b.htm">sanctity</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.

<p>In his sixteenth year, Patrick was carried off into captivity by <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> marauders and was sold as a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> to a chieftan named Milchu in Dalriada, a territory of the present county of Antrim in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, where for six years he tended his master's flocks in the valley of the Braid and on the slopes of Slemish, near the modern town of Ballymena. He relates in his "Confessio" that during his captivity while tending the flocks he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> many times in the day: "the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>", he added,

<blockquote><p>and His <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> increased in me more and more, and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> grew in me, and the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> was roused, so that, in a single day, I have said as many as a hundred <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and in the night nearly the same, so that whilst in the woods and on the mountain, even before the dawn, I was roused to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and felt no hurt from it, whether there was snow or ice or rain; nor was there any <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothfulness</a> in me, such as I see now, because the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> was then fervent within me. </p></blockquote>

<p>In the ways of a benign <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Providence</a> the six years of Patrick's captivity became a remote preparation for his future apostolate. He acquired a perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Celtic tongue in which he would one day announce the glad tidings of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a>, and, as his master Milchu was a <a href="../cathen/05162a.htm">druidical</a> high <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he became familiar with all the details of <a href="../cathen/05162a.htm">Druidism</a> from whose bondage he was destined to liberate the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> race.

<p>Admonished by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> he after six years fled from his cruel master and bent his steps towards the west. He relates in his "Confessio" that he had to travel about 200 miles; and his journey was probably towards <a href="../cathen/08640a.htm">Killala Bay</a> and onwards thence to Westport. He found a ship ready to set sail and after some rebuffs was allowed on board. In a few days he was among his friends once more in <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">Britain</a>, but now his heart was set on devoting himself to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">sacred ministry</a>. We meet with him at St. Martin's <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, and again at the island sanctuary of <a href="../cathen/09188b.htm">L&eacute;rins</a> which was just then acquiring widespread renown for learning and piety; and wherever lessons of heroic perfection in the exercise of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life could be acquired, thither the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">fervent</a> Patrick was sure to bend his steps. No sooner had <a href="../cathen/06472b.htm">St. Germain</a> entered on his great mission at Auxerre than Patrick put himself under his guidance, and it was at that great <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> hands that <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland's</a> future apostle was a few years later promoted to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. It is the tradition in the territory of the Morini that Patrick under <a href="../cathen/06472b.htm">St. Germain's</a> guidance for some years was engaged in missionary work among them. When <a href="../cathen/06472b.htm">Germain</a> commissioned by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> proceeded to <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">Britain</a> to combat the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> teachings of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>, he chose Patrick to be one of his missionary companions and thus it was his <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a> to be associated with the representative of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the triumphs that ensued over <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Paganism</a>, and in the many remarkable events of the expedition, such as the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> calming of the tempest at sea, the visit to the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> at <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban's</a> shrine, and the Alleluia victory. Amid all these scenes, however, Patrick's thoughts turned towards <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and from <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> to <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> he was favoured with <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> of the children from Focluth, by the Western sea, who cried to him: "O <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> youth, come back to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Erin</a>, and walk once more amongst us."

<p><a href="../cathen/03477c.htm">Pope St. Celestine I</a>, who rendered immortal service to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the overthrow of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, and by the imperishable wreath of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decreed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05491a.htm">General Council of Ephesus</a>, <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> his pontificate by an act of the most far-reaching consequences for the spread of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and civilization, when he entrusted St. Patrick with the mission of gathering the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> race into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">one fold</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a> had already received that commission, but terrified by the fierce opposition of a Wicklow chieftain had abandoned the sacred enterprise. It was <a href="../cathen/06472b.htm">St. Germain</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Auxerre, who commended Patrick to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The writer of <a href="../cathen/06472b.htm">St. Germain's</a> Life in the ninth century, Heric of Auxerre, thus attests this important fact: "Since the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the father shines in the training of the children, of the many sons in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> whom <a href="../cathen/06472b.htm">St. Germain</a> is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have had as <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in religion, let it suffice to make mention here, very briefly, of one most famous, Patrick, the special Apostle of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> nation, as the record of his work <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proves</a>. Subject to that most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> discipleship for 18 years, he drank in no little <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> from the stream of so great a well-spring. <a href="../cathen/06472b.htm">Germain</a> sent him, accompanied by Segetius, his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, to <a href="../cathen/03477c.htm">Celestine</a>, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, approved of by whose judgement, supported by whose authority, and strengthened by whose <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, he went on his way to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>." It was only shortly before his death that <a href="../cathen/03477c.htm">Celestine</a> gave this mission to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland's</a> apostle and on that occasion bestowed on him many <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> and other spiritual gifts, and gave him the name "Patercius" or "Patritius", not as an honorary title, but as a foreshadowing of the fruitfulness and merit of his apostolate whereby he became <em>pater civium</em> (the father of his people). Patrick on his return journey from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> received at <a href="../cathen/08258a.htm">Ivrea</a> the tidings of the death of <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a>, and turning aside to the neighboring city of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> received episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> at the hands of its great <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/10081a.htm">St. Maximus</a>, and thence hastened on to Auxerre to make under the guidance of <a href="../cathen/06472b.htm">St. Germain</a> due preparations for the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> mission.

<p>It was probably in the summer months of the year 433, that Patrick and his companions landed at the mouth of the Vantry River close by Wicklow Head. The <a href="../cathen/05162a.htm">Druids</a> were at once in arms against him. But Patrick was not disheartened. The intrepid missionary resolved to search out a more friendly territory in which to enter on his mission. First of all, however, he would proceed towards Dalriada, where he had been a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>, to pay the price of ransom to his former master, and in exchange for the servitude and cruelty endured at his hands to impart to him the blessings and freedom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> children. He rested for some days at the islands off the Skerries coast, one of which still retains the name of Inis-Patrick, and he probably visited the adjoining mainland, which in olden times was known as Holm Patrick. <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Tradition</a> fondly points out the impression of St. Patrick's foot upon the hard rock &#151; off the main shore, at the entrance to Skerries harbour. Continuing his course northwards he halted at the mouth of the River Boyne. A number of the natives there gathered around him and heard with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in their own sweet tongue the glad tidings of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a>. There too he performed his first <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> on <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> soil to confirm the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> due to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15448a.htm">Divine birth of our Saviour</a>. Leaving one of his companions to continue the work of instruction so auspiciously begun, he hastened forward to Strangford Loughand there quitting his boat continued his journey over land towards Slemish. He had not proceeded far when a chieftain, named Dichu, appeared on the scene to prevent his further advance. He drew his sword to smite the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, but his arm became rigid as a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> and continued so until he declared himself <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to Patrick. Overcome by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> meekness and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, Dichu asked for instruction and made a gift of a large <em>sabhall</em> (barn), in which the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacred mysteries</a> were offered up. This was the first <a href="../cathen/13431a.htm">sanctuary</a> <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> by St. Patrick in Erin. It became in later years a chosen <a href="../cathen/12795b.htm">retreat</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. A <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and church were erected there, and the hallowed site retains the name Sabhall (pronounced Saul) to the present day. Continuing his journey towards Slemish, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was struck with horror on seeing at a distance the fort of his old master Milchu enveloped in flames. The fame of Patrick's marvelous <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">power of miracles</a> preceeded him. Milchu, in a fit of frenzy, gathered his treasures into his mansion and setting it on fire, cast himself into the flames. An ancient record adds: "His <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> could not endure the thought of being vanquished by his former <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>".

<p>Returning to Saul, St. Patrick learned from Dichu that the chieftains of Erin had been summoned to celebrate a special <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> at Tara by Leoghaire, who was the Ard-Righ, that is, the Supreme Monarch of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. This was an opportunity which Patrick would not forego; he would present himself before the assembly, to strike a decisive blow against the <a href="../cathen/05162a.htm">Druidism</a> that held the nation captive, and to secure freedom for the glad tidings of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a> of which he was the herald. As he journeyed on he rested for some days at the house of a chieftain named Secsnen, who with his household joyfully embraced the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. The youthful Benen, or <a href="../cathen/02479b.htm">Benignus</a>, son of the chief, was in a special way captivated by the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Gospel doctrines</a> and the meekness of Patrick. Whilst the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> slumbered he would gather sweet-scented flowers and scatter them over his bosom, and when Patrick was setting out, continuing his journey towards Tara, Benen clung to his feet declaring that nothing would sever him from him. "Allow him to have his way", said St. Patrick to the chieftain, "he shall be heir to my sacred mission." Thenceforth Benen was the inseparable companion of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> was fulfilled, for Benen is named among the "comhards" or <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">sucessors</a> of St. Patrick in <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>.

<p>It was on 26 March, <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a>, in 433, that the eventful assembly was to meet at Tara, and the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> went forth that from the preceeding day the fires throughout the kingdom should be extinguished until the signal blaze was kindled at the royal mansion. The chiefs and Brehons came in full numbers and the <a href="../cathen/05162a.htm">druids</a> too would muster all their strength to bid defiance to the herald of good tidings and to secure the hold of their <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> on the Celtic race, for their <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demoniac</a> <a href="../cathen/11264c.htm">oracles</a> had announced that the messenger of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had come to Erin. St. Patrick arrived at the hill of Slane, at the opposite extremity of the valley from Tara, on <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Easter Eve</a>, in that year the <a href="../cathen/01542a.htm">feast of the Annunciation</a>, and on the summit of the hill kindled the Paschal <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">fire</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05162a.htm">druids</a> at once raised their voice. "O King", (they said) "live for ever; this <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">fire</a>, which has been lighted in defiance of the royal edict, will blaze for ever in this land unless it be this very night extinguished." By order of the king and the agency of the <a href="../cathen/05162a.htm">druids</a>, repeated attempts were made to extinguish the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">fire</a> and to punish with death the intruder who had disobeyed the royal command. But the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">fire</a> was not extinguished and Patrick shielded by the Divine power came unscathed from their snares and assaults. On <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Day</a> the missionary band having at their head the youth <a href="../cathen/02479b.htm">Benignus</a> bearing aloft a copy of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, and followed by St. Patrick who with <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> and <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crozier</a> was arrayed in full <a href="../cathen/12231b.htm">episcopal attire</a>, proceeded in processional order to Tara. The <a href="../cathen/05162a.htm">druids</a> and magicians put forth all their strength and employed all their incantations to maintain their sway over the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> race, but the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Patrick achieved a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> triumph. The <a href="../cathen/05162a.htm">druids</a> by their incantations overspread the hill and surrounding plain with a cloud of worse than <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> darkness. Patrick defied them to remove that cloud, and when all their efforts were made in vain, at his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> the sun sent forth its rays and the brightest sunshine lit up the scene. Again by <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniac</a> power the Arch-Druid Lochru, like <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> of old, was lifted up high in the air, but when Patrick <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">knelt</a> in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> the <a href="../cathen/05162a.htm">druid</a> from his flight was dashed to pieces upon a rock.


<p>Thus was the final blow given to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> in the presence of all the assembled chieftains. It was, indeed, a momentous day for the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> race. Twice Patrick pleaded for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> before Leoghaire. The king had given orders that no sign of respect was to be extended to the strangers, but at the first meeting the youthful Erc, a royal page, arose to show him reverence; and at the second, when all the chieftains were assembled, the chief-bard Dubhtach showed the same <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. Both these heroic men became fervent <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and bright ornaments of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It was on this second solemn occasion that St. Patrick is said to have plucked a shamrock from the sward, to explain by its triple leaf and single stem, in some rough way, to the assembled chieftains, the great <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a>. On that bright <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Day</a>, the triumph of religion at Tara was complete. The Ard-Righ granted permission to Patrick to preach the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> throughout the length and breadth of Erin, and the <a href="../cathen/05162a.htm">druidical</a> <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> like the words of <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a> of old would be fulfilled: the sacred fire now kindled by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> would never be extinguished.

<p>The beautiful <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of St. Patrick, popularly known as "St. Patrick's Breast-Plate", is supposed to have been composed by him in preparation for this victory over <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Paganism</a>. The following is a literal translation from the old <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> text:

<p>St. Patrick remained during <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> week at Slane and Tara, unfolding to those around him the lessons of Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Meanwhile the national games were being celebrated a few miles distant at Tailten (now Telltown) in connection with the royal feast. St. Patrick proceeding thither solemnly administered <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to Conall, brother of the Ard-Righ Leoghaire, on Wednesday, 5 April. Benen and others had already been privately gathered into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">fold of Christ</a>, but this was the first public administering of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, recognized by royal edict, and hence in the ancient <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Kalendars to the fifth of April is assigned "the beginning of the Baptism of Erin". This first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> royal chieftain made a gift to Patrick of a site for a church which to the present day retains the name of Donagh-Patrick. The <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> was with Conall's <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. <a href="../cathen/04136a.htm">St. Columba</a> is reckoned among his descendants, and many of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> until the eleventh century were of his race. St. Patrick left some of his companions to carry on the work of evangelization in <a href="../cathen/10097a.htm">Meath</a>, thus so auspiciously begun. He would himself visit the other territories. Some of the chieftains who had come to Tara were from Focluth, in the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/08640a.htm">Killala</a>, in Connaught, and as it was the children of Focluth who in vision had summoned him to return to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, he resolved to accompany those chieftains on their return, that thus the district of Focluth would be among the first to receive the glad tidings of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a>. It affords a convincing <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the difficulties that St. Patrick had to overcome, that though full liberty to preach the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> throughout Erin was granted by the monarch of Leoghaire, nevertheless, in order to procure a safe conduct through the intervening territories whilst proceeding towards Connaught he had to pay the price of fifteen <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slaves</a>. On his way thither, passing through Granard he learned that at Magh-Slecht, not far distant, a vast concourse was engaged in offering worship to the chief idol Crom-Cruach. It was a huge pillar-stone, covered with slabs of gold and silver, with a circle of twelve minor <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> around it. He proceeded thither, and with his <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a> smote the chief idol that crumbled to dust; the others fell to the ground. At <a href="../cathen/08640a.htm">Killala</a> he found the whole people of the territory assembled. At his preaching, the king and his six sons, with 12,000 of the people, became docile to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. He spent seven years visiting every district of Connaught, organizing <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, forming <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and instructing the chieftains and people.

<p>On the occasion of his first visit to Rathcrogan, the royal seat of the kings of Connaught, situated near Tulsk, in the County of <a href="../cathen/13190a.htm">Roscommon</a>, a remarkable incident occurred, recorded in many of the <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authentic</a> narratives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>. Close by the clear fountain of Clebach, not far from the royal abode, Patrick and his venerable companions had pitched their tents and at early dawn were <a href="../cathen/09304a.htm">chanting</a> the praises of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Most High</a>, when the two daughters of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> monarch &#151; Ethne, the fair, and Fedelm, the ruddy &#151; came thither, as was their wont, to bathe. Astonished at the vision that presented itself to them, the royal maidens cried out: "Who are ye, and whence do ye come? Are ye phantoms, or fairies, or friendly mortals?" St. Patrick said to them: "It were better you would <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> and worship the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">one true God</a>, whom we announce to you, than that you would satisfy your curiosity by such vain questions." And then Ethne broke forth into the questions:

<blockquote><p>"Who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?"<br>"And where is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?"<br>"Where is His dwelling?"<br>"Has He sons and daughters?"<br>"Is He rich in silver and gold?"<br>"Is He everlasting? is He beautiful?"<br>"Are His daughters dear and lovely to the men of this world?"<br>"Is He on the heavens or on earth?"<br>"In the sea, in rivers, in mountains, in valleys?"<br>"Make Him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us. How is He to be seen?"<br>"How is He to be <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a>? How is He to be found?"<br>"Is it in youth or is it in old age that He may be found?"</p></blockquote>

<p>But St. Patrick, filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, made answer:

<blockquote><p>"<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom we announce to you, is the Ruler of all things."<br>"The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of heaven and earth, of the sea and the rivers."<br>"The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the sun, and the moon, and all the stars."<br>"The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the high mountains and of the low-lying valleys."<br>"The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who is above heaven, and in heaven, and under heaven."<br>"His dwelling is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, and the sea, and all therein."<br>"He gives breath to all."<br>"He gives <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> to all."<br>"He is over all."<br>"He upholds all."<br>"He gives light to the sun."<br>"He imparts splendour to the moon."<br>"He has made wells in the dry land, and islands in the ocean."<br>"He has appointed the stars to serve the greater lights."<br>"His Son is co-eternal and co-equal with Himself."<br>"The Son is not younger than the Father."<br>"And the Father is not older than the Son."<br>"And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> proceeds from them."<br>"The Father and the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are undivided."<br>"But I desire by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> to unite you to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Heavenly King</a>, as you are daughters of an earthly king."</p></blockquote>

<p>The maidens, as if with one voice and one heart, said: "Teach us most carefully how we may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Heavenly King</a>; show us how we may behold Him <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">face to face</a>, and we will do whatsoever you shall say to us."

<p>And when he had instructed them he said to them: "Do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> you put off the <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">sin</a> inherited from the first <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>."

<p>They answered: "We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>."

<p>"Do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in penance after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>?"

<p>"We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>."

<p>"Do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">life after death</a>?" Do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection on the Day of Judgement</a>?"

<p>"We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>."

<p>"Do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a>?"

<p>"We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>."

<p>Then they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and were clothed in white garments. And they besought that they might behold the face of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> said to them: "You cannot see the face of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> unless you taste death, and unless you receive the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice</a>." They answered: "Give us the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">Sacrifice</a>, so that we may be able to behold our <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Spouse</a>." And the ancient narrative adds: "when they received the <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">Eucharist of God</a>, they slept in death, and they were placed upon a couch, arrayed in their white <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> robes."

<p>In 440 St. Patrick entered on the special work of the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of Ulster. Under the following year, the ancient <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalists</a> relate a wonderful spread of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> throughout the province. In 444 a site for a church was granted at Armagh by Daire, the chieftain of the district. It was in a valley at the foot of a hill, but the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was not content. He had special designs in his heart for that district, and at length the chieftain told him to select in his territory any site he would deem most suitable for his religious purpose. St. Patrick chose that beautiful hill on which the old <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Armagh stands. As he was marking out the church with his companions, they came upon a doe and fawn, and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> companions would kill them for food; but St. Patrick would not allow them to do so, and, taking the fawn upon his shoulders, and followed by the doe, he proceeded to a neighbouring hill, and laid down the fawn, and announced that there, in future times, great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> would be given to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Most High</a>. It was precisely upon that hill thus fixed by St. Patrick that, a few years ago, there was solemnly <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> the new and beautiful <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Armagh. A representative of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> presided on the occasion, and hundreds of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were gathered there; and, indeed, it might truly be said, the whole <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> race on that occasion offered up that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Most High</a> as tribute to their united <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and piety, and their never-failing <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>From Ulster St. Patrick probably proceeded to <a href="../cathen/10097a.htm">Meath</a> to consolidate the organization of the communities there, and thence he continued his course through Leinster. Two of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> most distinguished companions, St. Auxilius and St. Iserninus, had the rich valley of the Liffey assigned to them. The former's name is still retained in the church which he founded at Killossy, while the latter is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Kilcullen. As usual, St. Patrick's primary care was to gather the ruling chieftains into the fold. At Naas, the royal residence in those days, he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptised</a> two sons of the King of Leinster. Memorials of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> still abound in the district &#151; the ruins of the ancient church which he founded, his holy well, and the hallowed sites in which the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was shown forth in <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. At Sletty, in the immediate neighborhood of Carlow, <a href="../cathen/06066b.htm">St. Fiacc</a>, son of the chief Brehon, Dubthach, was installed as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and for a considerable <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> continued to be the chief centre of religion for all Leinster. St. Patrick proceeded through Gowran into <a href="../cathen/11342b.htm">Ossory</a>; here he erected a church under the invocation of <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin</a>, near the present city of Kilkenny, and enriched it with many precious <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> which he had brought from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It was in Leinster, on the borders of the present counties of <a href="../cathen/08636c.htm">Kildare</a> and Queen's, that Odhran, St. Patrick's charioteer, attained the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> crown. The chieftain of that district <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> the demon-idol, Crom Cruach, with special worship, and, on hearing of that idol being cast down, <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vowed</a> to avenge the insult by the death of our apostle. Passing through the territory, Odhran overheard the plot that was being organized for the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of St. Patrick, and as they were setting out in the chariot to continue their journey, asked the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, as a favour, to take thereins, and to allow himself, for the day, to hold the place of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and rest. This was granted, and scarcely had they set out when a well-directed thrust of a lance pierced the heart of the devoted charioteer, who thus, by changing places, saved St. Patrick's <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>, and won for himself the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> crown.

<p>St. Patrick next proceeded to Munster. As usual, his efforts were directed to combat <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in the chief centres of authority, knowing well that, in the paths of <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>, the kings and chieftains would soon be followed by their subjects. At "Cashel of the Kings" he was received with great enthusiasm, the chiefs and Brehons and people welcoming him with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyous</a> acclaim. While engaged in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the royal prince Aengus, son of the King of Munster, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, leaning on his <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>, pierced with its sharp point the prince's foot. Aengus bore the pain unmoved. When St. Patrick, at the close of the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, saw the blood flow, and asked him why he had been silent, he replied, with genuine heroism, that he thought it might be part of the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, a penalty for the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyous</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> that were imparted. The saint admired his heroism, and, taking the chieftain's shield, inscribed on it a cross with the same point of the <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crozier</a>, and promised that that shield would be the signal of countless spiritual and temporal triumphs.

<p>Our apostle spent a considerable <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> in the present <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">County of Limerick</a>. The fame of his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> had gone before him, and the inhabitants of Thomond and northern Munster, crossing the Shannon in their frail coracles, hastened to receive his instruction. When giving his <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> to them on the summit of the hill of Finnime, looking out on the rich plains before him, he is said to have <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesied</a> the coming of <a href="../cathen/13713a.htm">St. Senanus</a>: "To the green island in the West, at the mouth of the sea [i.e., Inis-Cathaigh, now Scattery Island, at the mouth of the Shannon, near Kilrush], the lamp of the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will come; he will be the head of counsel to all this territory." At Sangril (now Singland), in <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, and also in the district of Gerryowen, the holy wells of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> are pointed out, and the slab of rock, which served for his bed, and the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a> on which every day he offered up the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>. On the banks of the Suit, and the Blackwater, and the Lee, wherever the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> preached during the seven years he spent in Munster, a hearty welcome awaited him. The ancient Life attests: "After Patrick had founded cells and churches in Munster, and had <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of every grade, and healed the sick, and resuscitated the dead, he bade them farewell, and imparted his <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> to them." The words of this <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, which is said to have been given from the hills of Tipperary, as registered in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> Life, to which I have just referred, are particularly beautiful:

<blockquote><p>A <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> on the Munster people &#151; <br>Men, youths, and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; <br>A <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> on the land <br>That yields them fruit.<br> <br>A <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> on every treasure <br>That shall be produced on their plains, <br>Without any one being in want of help, <br><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> be on Munster.<br> <br>A <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> on their peaks, <br>On their bare flagstones, <br>A <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> on their glens, <br>A <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> on their ridges.<br> <br>Like the sand of the sea under ships, <br>Be the number in their hearths; <br>On slopes, on plains, <br>On mountains, on hills, a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>St. Patrick continued until his death to visit and watch over the churches which he had founded in all the provinces in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. He comforted the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> in their difficulties, strengthened them in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and in the practice of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and appointed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> to continue his work among them. It is recorded in his Life that he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> no fewer than 350 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. He appointed <a href="../cathen/09335a.htm">St. Loman</a> to Trim, which rivalled Armagh itself in its abundant harvest of piety. St. Guasach, son of his former master, Milchu, became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Granard, while the two daughters of the same <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> chieftan founded close by, at Clonbroney, a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of pious <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and merited the aureola of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. St. Mel, nephew of our <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, had the charge of <a href="../cathen/01699c.htm">Ardagh</a>; St. MacCarthem, who appears to have been patricularly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> by St. Patrick, was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04059c.htm">Clogher</a>. The narrative in the ancient Life of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> regarding his visit to the district of Costello, in the County of Mayo, serves to illustrate his manner of dealing with the chieftains. He found, it says, the chief, Ernasc, and his son, Loarn, sitting under a tree, "with whom he remained, together with his twelve companions, for a week, and they received from him the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> with attentive ear and <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Meanwhile he instructed Loarn in the rudiments of learning and piety." A church was erected there, and, in after years, Loarn was appointed to its charge.

<p>The manifold <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> by which the early <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were distinguished shone forth in all their <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfection</a> in the life of St. Patrick. When not engaged in the work of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">sacred ministry</a>, his whole <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> was spent in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Many times in the day he armed himself with the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the Cross</a>. He never relaxed his penitential exercises. Clothed in a rough <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">hair-shirt</a>, he made the hard rock his bed. His disinterestedness is specially commemorated. Countless <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a> of high rank would cast their precious ornaments at his feet, but all were restored to them. He had not come to Erin in search of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">material wealth</a>, but to enrich her with the priceless treasures of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>.

<p>From <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> to <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> he withdrew from the spiritual <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his apostolate to devote himself wholly to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and penance. One of his chosen places of solitude and <a href="../cathen/12795b.htm">retreat</a> was the island of Lough Derg, which, to our own day, has continued to be a favourite resort of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, and it is known as <a href="../cathen/12580a.htm">St. Patrick's Purgatory</a>. Another theatre of his <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">miraculous power</a> and piety and penitential austerities in the west of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> merits particular attention. In the far west of Connaught there is a range of tall mountains, which, arrayed in rugged majesty, bid defiance to the waves and storms of the Atlantic. At the head of this range arises a stately cone in solitary grandeur, about 4000 feet in height, facing Clew Bay, and casting its shadow over the adjoining districts of Aghagower and Westport. This mountain was known in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> times as the Eagle Mountain, but ever since <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> was enlightened with the light of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> it is known as <a href="../cathen/04509b.htm">Croagh Patrick</a>, i.e. St. Patrick's mountain, and is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as the Holy Hill, the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a>, of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>.

<p>St. Patrick, in obedience to his <a href="../cathen/07049c.htm">guardian angel</a>, made this mountain his hallowed place of <a href="../cathen/12795b.htm">retreat</a>. In imitation of the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">great Jewish legislator</a> on <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Sinai</a>, he spent forty days on its summit in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and other penitential exercises. His only shelter from the fury of the elements, the wind and rain, the hail and snow, was a cave, or recess, in the solid rock; and the flagstone on which he rested his weary limbs at night is still pointed out. The whole purpose of his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was to obtain special <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> and mercy for the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> race, whom he evangelized. The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> that made <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> their battlefield mustered all their strength to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> and disturb him in his solitude, and turn him away, if possible, from his pious purpose. They gathered around the hill in the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> of vast flocks of hideous birds of prey. So dense were their ranks that they seemed to cover the whole mountain, like a cloud, and they so filled the air that Patrick could see neither sky nor earth nor ocean. St. Patrick besought <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to scatter the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, but for a <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> it would seem as if his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and tears were in vain. At length he rang his sweet-sounding <a href="../cathen/02418b.htm">bell</a>, symbol of his preaching of the Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>. Its sound was heard all over the valleys and hills of Erin, everywhere bringing peace and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. The flocks of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> began to scatter. He flung his <a href="../cathen/02418b.htm">bell</a> among them; they took to precipitate flight, and cast themselves into the ocean. So complete was the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> victory over them that, as the ancient narrative adds, "for seven years no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing was to be found in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>."

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, however, would not, as yet, descend from the mountain. He had vanquished the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, but he would now wrestle with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, like <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> of old, to secure the spiritual interests of his people. The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> had announced to him that, to reward his fidelity in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and penance, as many of his people would be gathered into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> as would cover the land and sea as far as his vision could reach. Far more ample, however, were the aspirations of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, and he resolved to persevere in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> until the fullest measure of his petition was granted. Again and again the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> came to comfort him, announcing new concessions; but all these would not suffice. He would not relinquish his post on the mountain, or relax his penance, until all were granted. At length the message came that his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were heard:

<ul><li>many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> would be free from the pains of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> through his <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a>; <li>whoever in the spirit of penance would recite his <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> before death would attain the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly reward</a>; <li>barbarian hordes would never obtain sway in his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; <li>seven years before the Judgement Day, the sea would spread over <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> to save its people from the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> and terrors of the <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>; and <li>greatest <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of all, Patrick himself should be deputed to judge the whole <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> race on the last day.</ul>

<p>Such were the extraordinary favors which St. Patrick, with his wrestling with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Most High</a>, his unceasing <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, his unconquerable <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a> things, and his unremitting <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penitential</a> deeds, obtained for the people whom he evangelized.

<p>It is sometimes supposed that St. Patrick's apostolate in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> was an unbroken series of peaceful triumphs, and yet it was quite the reverse. No storm of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was, indeed stirred up to assail the infant <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> himself was subjected to frequent trials at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/05162a.htm">druids</a> and of other enemies of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. He tells us in his "Confessio" that no fewer than twelve times he and his companions were seized and carried off as captives, and on one occasion in particular he was loaded with chains, and his death was <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decreed</a>. But from all these trials and sufferings he was liberated by a benign <a href="../cathen/12509a.htm">Providence</a>. It is on account of the many hardships which he endured for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> that, in some of the ancient <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">Martyrologies</a>, he is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>.

<p>St. Patrick, having now completed his triumph over <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Paganism</a>, and gathered <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">fold of Christ</a>, prepared for the summons to his <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">reward</a>. <a href="../cathen/02784b.htm">St. Brigid</a> came to him with her chosen <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, bringing the shroud in which he would be enshrined. It is recorded that when St. Patrick and <a href="../cathen/02784b.htm">St. Brigid</a> were united in their last <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, a special vision was shown to him. He saw the whole of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> lit up with the brightest rays of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Divine Faith</a>. This continued for centuries, and then clouds gathered around the devoted island, and, little by little, the religious <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> faded away, until, in the course of centuries, it was only in the remotest valleys that some glimmer of its light remained. St. Patrick <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that the light would never be extinguished, and, as he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> came to him and said: "Fear not: your apostolate shall never cease." As he thus <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, the glimmering light grew in brightness, and ceased not until once more all the hills and valleys of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> were lit up in their pristine splendour, and then the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> announced to St. Patrick: "Such shall be the abiding splendour of Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>."

<p>At Saul (Sabhall), St. Patrick received the summons to his <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">reward</a> on 17 March, 493 [See note above &#151; <em>Ed.</em>]. <a href="../cathen/14663a.htm">St. Tassach</a> administered the last <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to him. His <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">remains</a> were wrapped in the shroud woven by St. Brigid's own hands. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and faithful people from all parts crowded around his remains to pay due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the Father of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Some of the ancient Lives record that for several days the light of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> shone around his bier. His remains were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> at the chieftan's Dun or Fort two miles from Saul, where in after times arose the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/05147a.htm">Down</a>.
<h2>Writings of St. Patrick</h2>

<p>The "Confessio" and the "Epistola ad Coroticum" are recognized by all modern critical writers as of unquestionable genuineness. The best edition, with text, translation, and critical notes, is by <a href="../cathen/15611a.htm">Rev. Dr. White</a> for the Royal Irish Academy, in 1905. The 34 <a href="../cathen/03287a.htm">canons</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held before the year 460 by St. Patrick, Auxilius, and Isserninus, though rejected by Todd and Haddan, have been placed by Professor Bury beyond the reach of controversy. Another series of 31 <a href="../cathen/03287a.htm">ecclesiastical canons</a> entitled "Synodus secunda Patritii", though unquestionably of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> origin and <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> before the close of the seventh century, is generally considered to be of a later <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> than St. Patrick. Two tracts (in P.L., LIII), entitled "De abusionibus saeculi", and "De Tribus habitaculis", were composed by St. Patrick in Irish and translated into Latin at a later period. Passages from them are assigned to St. Patrick in the "Collectio Hibernensis Canonum", which is of unquestionable authority and dates from the year 700 (Wasserschleben, 2nd ed., 1885). This "Collectio Hibernensis" also assigns to St. Patrick the famous synodical <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>: "Si quae quaestiones in hac insula oriantur, ad Sedem Apostolicam referantur." (If any difficulties arise in this island, let them be referred to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>). The beautiful <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, known as "Faeth Fiada", or the "Lorica of St. Patrick" (St. Patrick's Breast-Plate), first edited by Petrie in his "History of Tara", is now universally accepted as genuine. The "Dicta Sancti Patritii", or brief sayings of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, preserved in the "Book of Armagh", are accurately edited by Fr. Hogan, S.J., in "Documenta de S. Patritio" (Brussels, 1884). The old Irish text of "The Rule of Patrick" has been edited by O'Keeffe, and a translation by Archbishop Healy in the appendix to his Life of St. Patrick (Dublin, 1905). It is a tract of venerable antiquity, and embodies the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>.
