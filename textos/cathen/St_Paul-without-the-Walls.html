<h1>St. Paul-without-the-Walls</h1>  

<p>(<em>San Paolo fuori le mura</em>).

<p>An <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> nullius. As early as 200 the burial place of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">great Apostle</a> in the Via <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> was marked by a <em>cella memori&aelig;</em>, near which the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Comodilla was established. <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, transformed it into <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a>; in 386 <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a> began the erection of a much larger and more beautiful basilica, but the work including the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> was not completed till the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo the Great</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> poet, Proudentius, describes the splendours of the monument in a few, expressive lines. As it was dedicated also to Saints Taurinus and Herculanus, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> in the fifth century, it was called the <em>basilica trium Dominorum.</em> Of the ancient basilica there remain only the interior portion of the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> with the triumphal arch and the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of the latter; the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> and the tabernacle of the confession of <a href="../cathen/01750a.htm">Arnolfo del Cambio</a> belong to the thirteenth century. In the old basilica each <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had his portrait in a frieze extending above the columns separating the four <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a> and <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a>. In 1823 a fire, started through the negligence of a workman who was repairing the lead of the roof, resulted in the destruction of the basilica. Alone of all the churches of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, it had preserved its primitive character for one thousand four hundred and thirty-five years. The whole world contributed to its restoration. The Khedive of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> sent pillars of alabaster, the Emperor of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> the precious malachite and lapis lazuli of the tabernacle. The work on the principal <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>, looking toward the Tiber, was completed by the Italian Government, which declared the church a national monument. The interior of the walls of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> are adorned with scenes from the life of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> in two series of <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> (Gagliardi, Podesti, Balbi, etc). The graceful <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was erected between 1220 and 1241. The <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> contains a fine <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a>. In the time of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> there were two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> near the basilica: St. Aristus's for men and St. Stefano's for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Services were carried out by a special body of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> instituted by <a href="../cathen/14002a.htm">Pope Simplicius</a>. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the basilica declined; <a href="../cathen/06787a.htm">St. Gregory II</a> restored the former and entrusted the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> with the care of the basilica. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> continued their generosity toward the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>; the basilica was again injured during the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> invasions in the ninth century. In consequence of this <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a> fortified the basilica, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and the dwellings of the peasantry, forming the town of Joannispolis, which was still remembered in the thirteenth century. In 937, when <a href="../cathen/11209a.htm">St. Odo of Cluny</a> came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Alberico II, patrician of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, entrusted the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and basilica to his congregation and <a href="../cathen/11209a.htm">Odo</a> placed Balduino of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> in charge. <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and in his time Pantaleone of <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a> presented the bronze gates of the basilica, which were executed by Constantinopolitan artists. <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> entrusted it to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the Congregation of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>. It was then made an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> nullius. The <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> extended over the districts of Civitella San Paolo, Leprignano, and Nazzano, all of which formed <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of San Paolo in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, however, is under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03341b.htm">cardinal vicar</a>.
