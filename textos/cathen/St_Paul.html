<h2 id="section1">Preliminary questions</h2>
<h3 id="A">Apocryphal Acts of St. Paul</h3>

<p>Professor Schmidt has published a photographic copy, a transcription, a German translation, and a commentary of a <a href="../cathen/16027d.htm">Coptic</a> papyrus composed of about 2000 fragments, which he has classified, juxtaposed, and deciphered at a cost of infinite labour ("Acta Pauli aus der Heidelberger koptischen Papyrushandschrift Nr. 1", Leipzig, 1904, and "Zusatze" etc., Leipzig, 1905). Most critics, whether <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> (Duchesne, Bardenhewer, Ehrhard etc.), or <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> (Zahn, Harnack, Corssen etc.), <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that these are real "Acta Pauli", although the text edited by Schmidt, with its very numerous gaps, represents but a small portion of the original work. This discovery modified the generally accepted <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> concerning the origin, contents, and value of these <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> Acts, and warrants the conclusion that three ancient compositions which have reached us formed an integral part of the "Acta Pauli" viz. the <a href="../fathers/0816.htm">"Acta Pauli et Theclae"</a>, of which the best edition is that of <a href="../cathen/09280b.htm">Lipsius</a>, ("Acta Apostolorum apocrypha", Leipzig, 1891, 235-72), a "Martyrium Pauli" preserved in Greek and a fragment of which also exists in Latin (op. cit., 104-17), and a letter from the Corinthians to Paul with the latter's reply, the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> text of which was preserved (cf. Zahn, "Gesch. des neutest. Kanons", II, 592-611), and the Latin discovered by Berger in 1891 (d. Harnack, "Die apokryphen Briefe des Paulus an die Laodicener und Korinther", Bonn, 1905). With great sagacity Zahn anticipated this result with regard to the last two documents, and the manner in which <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> speaks of the <em>periodoi</em> Pauli et Theclae (<a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 7</a>) might have permitted the same surmise with regard to the first.

<p>Another consequence of Schmidt's discovery is no less interesting. <a href="../cathen/09280b.htm">Lipsius</a> maintained &#151; and this was hitherto the common opinion &#151; that besides the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> "Acts" there formerly existed <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> "Acts of Paul", but now everything tends to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that the latter never existed. In fact <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> quotes the "Acta Pauli" twice as an estimable writing (<a href="../fathers/101520.htm"><em>Commentary on John</em> XX.12</a>; <a href="../fathers/04122.htm"><em>De Principiis</em> II.1.3</a>); <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.3.5</a> and <a href="../fathers/250103.htm">III.25.4</a>) places them among the books in dispute, such as the <a href="../fathers/0201.htm">"Shepherd" of Hermas</a>, the <a href="../fathers/1003.htm">"Apocalypse of Peter"</a>, the <a href="../fathers/0124.htm">"Epistle of Barnabas"</a>, and the <a href="../fathers/0714.htm">"Teaching of the Apostles"</a>. The stichometry of the "Codex Claromontanus" (photograph in Vigouroux, "Dict. de la Bible", II, 147) places them after the canonical books. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, while pointing out the legendary character of this writing, do not attack its <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. The precise purpose of St. Paul's correspondence with the Corinthians which formed part of the "Acts", was to oppose the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, Simon and Cleobius. But there is no reason to admit the existence of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> "Acts" which have since been hopelessly lost, for all the details given by ancient authors are verified in the "Acts" which have been recovered or tally well with them.

<p>The following is the explanation of the confusion: The <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manicheans</a> and <a href="../cathen/12429b.htm">Priscillianists</a> had circulated a collection of five <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> "Acts", four of which were tainted with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and the fifth were the "Acts of Paul". The "Acta Pauli", owing to this unfortunate association, are suspected of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heterodoxy</a> by the more recent authors such as <a href="../cathen/11797a.htm">Philastrius</a> (De haeres., 88) and <a href="../cathen/12043b.htm">Photius</a> (Cod., 114). <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (<a href="../fathers/0321.htm"><em>On Baptism</em> 17</a>) and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (<a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 7</a>) denounce the fabulous character of the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> "Acts" of Paul, and this severe judgment is amply confirmed by the examination of the fragments published by Schmidt. It is a purely <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginative</a> work in which improbability vies with absurdity. The author, who was acquainted with the canonical <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>, locates the scene in the places really visited by St. Paul (<a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, <a href="../cathen/07619a.htm">Iconium</a>, <a href="../cathen/10661a.htm">Myra</a>, <a href="../cathen/11667a.htm">Perge</a>, <a href="../cathen/13776a.htm">Sidon</a>, <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, Ephesus, <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, <a href="../cathen/12007b.htm">Philippi</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>), but for the rest he gives his fancy free rein. His <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> is absolutely impossible. Of the sixty-five <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> he names, very few are known and the part played by these is irreconcilable with the statements of the canonical "Acts". Briefly, if the canonical "Acts" are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> "Acts" are <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. This, however, does not imply that none of the details have historical foundation, but they must be confirmed by an independent authority.
<h3 id="B">Chronology</h3>

<p>If we admit according to the almost unanimous opinion of <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetes</a> that <a href="../bible/act015.htm">Acts 15</a> and <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs1">Galatians 2:1-10</a>, relate to the same fact it will be seen that an interval of seventeen years &mdash; or at least sixteen, counting incomplete years as accomplished &mdash; elapsed between the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of Paul and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> council, for Paul visited <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> three years after his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> (<a href="../bible/gal001.htm#vrs18">Galatians 1:18</a>) and returned after fourteen years for the meeting held with regard to legal observances (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs1">Galatians 2:1</a>: "<em>Epeita dia dekatessaron eton</em>"). It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that some authors include the three years prior to the first visit in the total of fourteen, but this explanation seems forced. On the other hand, twelve or thirteen years elapsed between the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> council and the end of the captivity, for the captivity lasted nearly five years (more than two years at <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">Caesarea</a>, <a href="../bible/act024.htm#vrs27">Acts 24:27</a>, six months travelling, including the sojourn at <a href="../cathen/09574a.htm">Malta</a>, and two years at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../bible/act028.htm#vrs30">Acts 28:30</a>); the third mission lasted not less than four years and a half (three of which were spent at Ephesus, <a href="../bible/act020.htm#vrs31">Acts 20:31</a>, and one between the departure from Ephesus and the arrival at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../bible/1co016.htm#vrs8">1 Corinthians 16:8</a>; <a href="../bible/act020.htm#vrs16">Acts 20:16</a>, and six months at the very least for the journey to Galatia, <a href="../bible/act018.htm#vrs23">Acts 18:23</a>); while the second mission lasted not less than three years (eighteen months for <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, <a href="../bible/act018.htm#vrs11">Acts 18:11</a>, and the remainder for the evangelization of Galatia, <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athens</a>, <a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs36">Acts 15:36</a>-<a href="../bible/act017.htm#vrs34">17:34</a>). Thus from the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> to the end of the first captivity we have a total of about twenty-nine years.

<p>Now if we could find a fixed point that is a synchronism between a fact in the life of Paul and a certainly <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> event in profane history, it would be easy to reconstruct the Pauline <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a>. Unfortunately this much wished-for mark has not yet been indicated with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, despite the numerous attempts made by scholars, especially in recent times. It is of interest to note even the abortive attempts, because the discovery of an <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">inscription</a> or of a <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coin</a> may any day transform an approximate <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> into an absolutely fixed point. These are

<ul>
<li>the meeting of Paul with Sergius Paulus, Proconsul of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, about the year 46 (<a href="../bible/act013.htm#vrs7">Acts 13:7</a>)
<li>the meeting at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> with <a href="../cathen/01661b.htm">Aquila and Priscilla</a>, who had been expelled from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, about 51 (<a href="../bible/act018.htm#vrs2">Acts 18:2</a>)
<li>the meeting with Gallio, Proconsul of <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaia</a>, about 53 (<a href="../bible/act018.htm#vrs12">Acts 18:12</a>)
<li>the address of Paul before the Governor Felix and his wife <a href="../cathen/05165b.htm">Drusilla</a> about 58 (<a href="../bible/act024.htm#vrs24">Acts 24:24</a>).</ul>

<p>All these events, as far as they may be assigned approximate <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dates</a>, agree with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle's</a> general <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> but give no precise results. Three synchronisms, however, appear to afford a firmer basis:

<p><em>(1) The occupation of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> by the ethnarch of King Aretas and the escape of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> three years after his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> (<a href="../bible/2co011.htm#vrs32">2 Corinthians 11:32-33</a>; <a href="../bible/act009.htm#vrs23">Acts 9:23-26</a>). &#151;</em> <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascene</a> <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> bearing the effigy of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a> to the year 34 are extant, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proving</a> that at that <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the city belonged to the Romans. It is impossible to assume that Aretas had received it as a gift from <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, for the latter, especially in his last years, was hostile to the King of the Nabataeans whom <a href="../cathen/15486e.htm">Vitellius</a>, Governor of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, was ordered to attack (Joseph., "Ant.", XVIII, v, 13); neither could Aretas have possessed himself of it by force for, besides the unlikelihood of a direct aggression against the Romans, the expedition of <a href="../cathen/15486e.htm">Vitellius</a> was at first directed not against <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> but against <a href="../cathen/11777b.htm">Petra</a>. It has therefore been somewhat plausibly conjectured that Caligula, subject as he was to such whims, had ceded it to him at the time of his accession (10 March, 37). As a matter of fact nothing is known of imperial <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> dating from either Caligula or Claudius. According to this hypothesis St. Paul's <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> was not prior to 34, nor his escape from <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> and his first visit to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, to 37.


<p><em>(2) Death of Agrippa, famine in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, mission of Paul and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to bring thither the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> from the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">Church of Antioch</a> (<a href="../bible/act011.htm#vrs27">Acts 11:27</a>-<a href="../bible/act012.htm#vrs25">12:25</a>). &#151;</em> <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#IV">Agrippa</a> died shortly after the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a> (<a href="../bible/act012.htm#vrs3">Acts 12:3</a>, <a href="../bible/act012.htm#vrs19">12:19</a>), when he was celebrating in <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">Caesarea</a> solemn festivals in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Claudius's recent return from <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">Britain</a>, in the third year of his reign, which had begun in 41 (<a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, "Ant.", XIX, vii, 2). These combined facts bring us to the year 44, and it is precisely in this year that <a href="../cathen/11322a.htm">Orosius</a> (Hist., vii, 6) places the great famine which desolated <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> mentions it somewhat later, under the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> Tiberius Alexander (about 46), but it is well known that the whole of Claudius's reign was characterized by poor harvests (Suet., "Claudius", 18) and a general famine was usually preceded by a more or less prolonged period of scarcity. It is also possible that the relief sent in anticipation of the famine <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">foretold</a> by <a href="../cathen/01200a.htm">Agabus</a> (<a href="../bible/act011.htm#vrs28">Acts 11:28-29</a>) preceded the appearance of the scourge or coincided with the first symptoms of want. On the other hand, the synchronism between the death of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> and the mission of Paul can only be approximate, for although the two facts are closely connected in the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts</a>, the account of the death of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#IV">Agrippa</a> may be a mere episode intended to shed light on the situation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> about the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of the arrival of the delegates from <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. In any case, 45 seems to be the most satisfactory <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>.

<p><em>(3) Replacing of Felix by Festus two years after the arrest to Paul (<a href="../bible/act024.htm#vrs27">Acts 24:27</a>). &#151;</em> Until recently chronologists commonly fixed this important event, in the year 60-61. Harnack, O. Holtzmann, and McGiffert suggest advancing it four or five years for the following reasons:

<p>(1) In his <a href="../cathen/05616a.htm">"Chronicon"</a>, <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> places the arrival of Festus in the second year of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> (October, 55-October, 56, or if, as is asserted, <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> makes the reigns of the emperors begin with the September after their accession, September, 56-September, 57). But it must be borne in mind that the chroniclers being always <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to give definite <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dates</a>, were likely to guess at them, and it may be that <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> for lack of definite information divided into two equal parts the entire duration of the government of Felix and Festus.

<p>(2) <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> states (Ant., XX, viii, 9) that Felix having been recalled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and accused by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, owed his safety only to his brother Pallas who was then high in favour. But according to Tacitus (Annal., XIII, xiv-xv), Pallas was dismissed shortly before Britannicus celebrated his fourteenth anniversary, that is, in January, 55. These two statements are irreconcilable; for if Pallas was dismissed three months after <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero's</a> accession (13 October, 54) he could not have been at the summit of his power when his brother Felix, recalled from Palestine at the command of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> about the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="../cathen/11661a.htm">Pentecost</a>, arrived at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Possibly Pallas, who after his dismissal retained his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and a portion of his influence, since he stipulated that his administration should not be subjected to an investigation, was able to be of assistance to his brother until 62 when <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, to obtain possession of his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">goods</a>, <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> had him poisoned.

<p>The advocates of a later <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> bring forward the following reasons:

<p>(1) Two years before the recall of Felix, Paul reminded him that he had been for many years judge over the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish nation</a> (<a href="../bible/act024.htm#vrs10">Acts 24:10-27</a>). This can scarcely mean less than six or seven years, and as, according to <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> who agrees with Tacitus, Felix was named <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> in 52, the beginning of the captivity would fall in 58 or 59. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the argument loses its strength if it be admitted with several critics that Felix before being <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> had held a subordinate position in Palestine.

<p>(2) <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (Ant., XX, viii, 5-8) places under <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> everything that pertains to the government of Felix, and although this long series of events does not necessarily require many years it is evident that <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> regarded the government of Felix as coinciding for the most part with the reign of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, which began on 13 October, 54.

<p>In fixing as follows the chief <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dates</a> in the life of Paul all <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> or probable data seem to be satisfactorily taken into account: <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">Conversion</a>, 35; first visit to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, 37; sojourn at <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>, 37-43; apostolate at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, 43-44; second visit to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, 44 or 45; first mission, 45-49; third visit to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, 49 or 50; second mission, 50-53; (<a href="../bible/1th000.htm">1</a> and <a href="../bible/2th000.htm">2 Thessalonians</a>), 52; fourth visit to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, 53; third mission, 53-57; (<a href="../bible/1co000.htm">1</a> and <a href="../bible/2co000.htm">2 Corinthians</a>; <a href="../bible/gal000.htm">Galatians</a>), 56; (<a href="../bible/rom000.htm">Romans</a>), 57; fifth visit to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, arrest, 57; arrival of Festus, departure for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 59; captivity at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 60-62; (<a href="../bible/phm001.htm">Philemon</a>; <a href="../bible/col000.htm">Colossians</a>; <a href="../bible/eph000.htm">Ephesians</a>; <a href="../bible/phi000.htm">Philippians</a>), 61; second period of activity, 62-66; (<a href="../bible/1ti000.htm">1 Timothy</a>; <a href="../bible/tit000.htm">Titus</a>), second arrest, 66; (<a href="../bible/2ti000.htm">2 Timothy</a>), <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, 67.

<h2 id="section2">Life and work of Paul</h2>
<h3 id="A">Birth and education</h3>

<p>From St. Paul himself we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he was born at <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a> in Cilicia (<a href="../bible/act021.htm#vrs39">Acts 21:39</a>), of a father who was a Roman citizen (<a href="../bible/act022.htm#vrs26">Acts 22:26-28</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/act016.htm#vrs37">16:37</a>), of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in which <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> was hereditary (<a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#vrs3">2 Timothy 1:3</a>) and which was much attached to <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisaic</a> traditions and observances (<a href="../bible/phi003.htm#vrs5">Philippians 3:5-6</a>).

<p><a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> relates, on what ground is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, that his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were natives of Gischala, a small town of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> and that they brought him to <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a> when Gischala was captured by the Romans (<a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 5</a>; "In epist. ad Phil.", 23). This last detail is certainly an anachronism, but the <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilean</a> origin of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> is not at all improbable.

<p>As he belonged to the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">tribe of Benjamin</a> he was given at the time of his <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> the name of Saul, which must have been common in that <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribe</a> in memory of the <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">first king of the Jews</a> (<a href="../bible/phi003.htm#vrs5">Philippians 3:5</a>). As a Roman citizen he also bore the Latin name of Paul. It was quite usual for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of that <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> to have two names, one Hebrew, the other Latin or Greek, between which there was often a certain assonance and which were joined together exactly in the manner made use of by <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">St. Luke</a> (<a href="../bible/act013.htm#vrs9">Acts 13:9</a>: <em>Saulos ho kai Paulos</em>). See on this point Deissmann, "Bible Studies" (Edinburgh, 1903, 313-17.) It was natural that in inaugurating his apostolate among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> Paul should have adopted his Roman name, especially as the name Saul had a ludicrous meaning in Greek.

<p>As every respectable <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> had to teach his son a trade, young Saul learned how to make tents (<a href="../bible/act018.htm#vrs3">Acts 18:3</a>) or rather to make the mohair of which tents were made (cf. Lewin, "Life of St. Paul", I, London, 1874, 8-9). He was still very young when sent to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to receive his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/06374b.htm">Gamaliel</a> (<a href="../bible/act022.htm#vrs3">Acts 22:3</a>). Possibly some of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> resided in the <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">holy city</a>; later there is mention of the presence of one of his sisters whose son saved his life (<a href="../bible/act023.htm#vrs16">Acts 23:16</a>).

<p>From that <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> it is absolutely impossible to follow him until he takes an active part in the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/14286b.htm">St. Stephen</a> (<a href="../bible/act007.htm#vrs58">Acts 7:58-60</a>; <a href="../bible/act022.htm#vrs20">22:20</a>). He was then qualified as a young man (<em>neanias</em>), but this was very elastic appellation and might be applied to a man between twenty and forty.
<h3 id="B">Conversion and early labours</h3>

<p>We read in the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> three accounts of the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of St. Paul (<a href="../bible/act009.htm#vrs1">9:1-19</a>; <a href="../bible/act022.htm#vrs3">22:3-21</a>; <a href="../bible/act026.htm#vrs9">26:9-23</a>) presenting some slight differences, which it is not difficult to harmonize and which do not affect the basis of the narrative, which is perfectly identical in substance. See J. Massie, "The Conversion of St. Paul" in "The Expositor", 3rd series, X, 1889, 241-62. Sabatier, agreeing with most independent critics, has well said (L'Apotre Paul, 1896, 42):

<blockquote><p>These differences cannot in any way alter the reality of the fact; their bearing on the narrative is extremely remote; they do not deal even with the circumstances accompanying the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> but with the subjective impressions which the companions of St. Paul received of these circumstances. . . . To base a denial of the historical character of the account upon these differences would seem therefore a <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> and arbitrary proceeding.</p></blockquote>

<p>All efforts hitherto made to explain without a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">apparition</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to Paul have failed. <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">Naturalistic</a> explanations are reduced to two: either Paul <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that he really saw <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but was the victim of an hallucination, or he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that he saw Him only through a spiritual vision, which <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a>, recorded in the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>, later <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> materialized. Renan explained everything by hallucination due to disease brought on by a combination of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> causes such as <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, remorse, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and of physical causes such as ophthalmia, fatigue, fever, the sudden transition from the torrid <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> to the fresh gardens of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, perhaps a sudden storm accompanied by lightning and thunder. All this combined, according to Renan's theory, to produce a cerebral commotion, a passing delirium which Paul took in <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a> for an <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">apparition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">risen</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p>The other partisans of a natural explanation while avoiding the word <em>hallucination</em>, eventually fall back on the system of Renan which they merely endeavour to render a little less complicated. Thus <a href="../cathen/07397a.htm">Holsten</a>, for whom the vision of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is only the conclusion of a series of syllogisms by which Paul persuaded himself that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was truly <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">risen</a>. So also Pfleiderer, who however, causes the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> to play a more influential part:

<blockquote><p>An excitable, nervous temperament; a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that had been <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> agitated and torn by the most terrible <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a>; a most vivid phantasy, occupied with the awful scenes of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> on the one hand and on the other by the ideal image of the celestial <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; in addition the nearness of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> with the urgency of a decision, the lonely stillness, the scorching and blinding heat of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> &#151; in fact everything combined to produce one of those <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstatic</a> states in which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> that it sees those images and conceptions which <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> agitate it as if they were phenomena proceeding from the outward world (<em>Lectures on the influence of the Apostle Paul on the development of Christianity</em>, 1897, 43).</p></blockquote>

<p>We have quoted Pfleiderer's words at length because his "psychological" explanation is considered the best ever devised. It will readily be seen that it is insufficient and as much opposed to the account in the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts</a> as to the express testimony of St. Paul himself.

<ul>
<li>Paul is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> of having "seen" <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as did the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs1">1 Corinthians 9:1</a>); he declares that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "appeared" to him (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs8">1 Corinthians 15:8</a>) as He appeared to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, to James, to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve</a>, after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>.
<li>He knows that his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> is not the fruit of his reasoning or thoughts, but an unforeseen, sudden, startling change, due to all-powerful grace (<a href="../bible/gal001.htm#vrs12">Galatians 1:12-15</a>; <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs10">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>).
<li>He is wrongly credited with <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a>, perplexities, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a>, remorse, before his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>. He was halted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> when his fury was at its height (<a href="../bible/act009.htm#vrs1">Acts 9:1-2</a>); it was "through <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>" that he <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (<a href="../bible/phi003.htm#vrs6">Philippians 3:6</a>), and he obtained mercy because he had acted "ignorantly in unbelief" (<a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#vrs13">1 Timothy 1:13</a>).</ul>

<p>All explanations, <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> or otherwise, are worthless in face of these definite assertions, for all suppose that it was Paul's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> which engendered the vision, whereas according to the concordant testimony of the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> it was the actual vision of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> which engendered <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>After his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>, his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> cure Paul set about preaching to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (<a href="../bible/act009.htm#vrs19">Acts 9:19-20</a>). He afterwards withdrew to <a href="../cathen/01674a.htm">Arabia</a> &#151; probably to the region south of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> (<a href="../bible/gal001.htm#vrs17">Galatians 1:17</a>), doubtless less to preach than to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">meditate</a> on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. On his return to <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> the intrigues of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> forced him to flee by night (<a href="../bible/2co011.htm#vrs32">2 Corinthians 11:32-33</a>; <a href="../bible/act009.htm#vrs23">Acts 9:23-25</a>). He went to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to see <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> (<a href="../bible/gal001.htm#vrs18">Galatians 1:18</a>), but remained only fifteen days, for the snares of the Greeks threatened his life. He then left for <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a> and is lost to sight for five or six years (<a href="../bible/act009.htm#vrs29">Acts 9:29-30</a>; <a href="../bible/gal001.htm#vrs21">Galatians 1:21</a>). <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> went in search of him and brought him to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> where for a year they worked together and their apostolate was most fruitful (<a href="../bible/act011.htm#vrs25">Acts 11:25-26</a>). Together also they were sent to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to carry <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to the brethren on the occasion of the famine predicted by <a href="../cathen/01200a.htm">Agabus</a> (<a href="../bible/act011.htm#vrs27">Acts 11:27-30</a>). They do not seem to have found the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> there; these had been scattered by the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>.
<h3 id="C">Apostolic career of Paul</h3>

<p>This period of twelve years (45-57) was the most active and fruitful of his life. It comprises three great <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> expeditions of which <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> was in each instance the starting-point and which invariably ended in a visit to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.

<h4>First mission (Acts 13:1-14:27)</h4>

<p>Set apart by command of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> for the special evangelization of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> and Saul embark for <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, preach in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of Salamina, cross the island from east to west doubtless following the southern coast, and reach <a href="../cathen/11457b.htm">Paphos</a>, the residence of the proconsul Sergius Paulus, where a sudden change takes place. After the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of the Roman proconsul, Saul, suddenly become Paul, is invariably mentioned before <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> by <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">St. Luke</a> and manifestly assumes the leadership of the mission which <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> has hitherto directed.

<p>The results of this change are soon evident. Paul, doubtless concluding that <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, the natural dependency of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Cilicia, would embrace the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> when these two countries should be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, chose <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> as the field of his apostolate and sailed for <a href="../cathen/11667a.htm">Perge</a> in Pamphylia, eighty miles above the mouth of the Cestrus. It was then that <a href="../cathen/09672c.htm">John Mark</a>, cousin of <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a>, dismayed perhaps by the daring projects of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a>, abandoned the expedition and returned to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, while Paul and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> laboured alone among the rough mountains of <a href="../cathen/12116b.htm">Pisidia</a>, which were infested by brigands and crossed by frightful precipices. Their destination was the Roman colony of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm#II">Antioch</a>, situated a seven day's journey from <a href="../cathen/11667a.htm">Perge</a>. Here Paul spoke on the vocation of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> sending of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, a discourse which <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">St. Luke</a> reproduces in substance as an example of his preaching in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> (<a href="../bible/act013.htm#vrs16">Acts 13:16-41</a>). The sojourn of the two missionaries in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm#II">Antioch</a> was long enough for the word of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> to be published throughout the whole country (<a href="../bible/act013.htm#vrs49">Acts 13:49</a>).

<p>When by their intrigues the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had obtained against them a decree of banishment, they went to <a href="../cathen/07619a.htm">Iconium</a>, three or four days distant, where they met with the same <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and the same eager welcome from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. The hostility of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> forced them to take refuge in the Roman colony of <a href="../cathen/09478c.htm">Lystra</a>, eighteen miles distant. Here the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm#ii">Antioch</a> and <a href="../cathen/07619a.htm">Iconium</a> laid snares for Paul and having <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> him left him for dead, but again he succeeded in escaping and this time sought refuge in <a href="../cathen/04738c.htm">Derbe</a>, situated about forty miles away on the frontier of the Province of Galatia. Their circuit completed, the missionaries retraced their steps in order to visit their <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a>, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in each <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> founded by them at such great cost, and thus reached <a href="../cathen/11667a.htm">Perge</a> where they halted to preach the Gospel, perhaps while awaiting an opportunity to embark for <a href="../cathen/02060b.htm">Attalia</a>, a port twelve miles distant. On their return to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch in Syria</a> after an absence of at least three years, they were received with transports of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and thanksgiving, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had opened the door of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.

<p>The problem of the status of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> now made itself felt with all its acuteness. Some <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judeo-Christians</a> coming down from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> claimed that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> must be submitted to <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and treated as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> treated <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselytes</a>. Against this Paul and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> protested and it was decided that a meeting should be held at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in order to solve the question. At this assembly Paul and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> represented the community of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> pleaded the freedom of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; James upheld him, at the same time demanding that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> should abstain from certain things which especially shocked the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.

<p>It was decided, first, that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were exempt from the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic law</a>. Secondly, that those of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Cilicia must abstain from things <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, from blood, from things strangled, and from fornication. Thirdly, that this injunction was laid upon them, not in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic law</a>, but in the name of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. This meant the complete triumph of Paul's <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>.

<p>The restriction imposed on the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a> of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Cilicia did not concern his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, and Titus, his companion, was not compelled to be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, despite the loud protests of the <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaizers</a> (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs3">Galatians 2:3-4</a>). Here it is to be assumed that <a href="../bible/gal002.htm">Galatians 2</a> and <a href="../bible/act015.htm">Acts 15</a> relate to the same fact, for the actors are the same, Paul and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> on the one hand, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and James on the other; the discussion is the same, the question of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; the scenes are the same, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> is the same, about A.D. 50; and the result is the same, Paul's victory over the <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaizers</a>.

<p>However, the decision of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> did not do away with all difficulties. The question did not concern only the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and while exempting them from the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic law</a>, it was not declared that it would not have been counted <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> and more <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a> for them to observe it, as the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> seemed to liken them to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselytes</a> of the second class. Furthermore the <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judeo-Christians</a>, not having been included in the verdict, were still free to consider themselves bound to the observance of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. This was the origin of the dispute which shortly afterwards arose at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> between <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and Paul. The latter taught openly that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was abolished for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> themselves. <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> did not think otherwise, but he considered it wise to avoid giving offence to the <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaizers</a> and to refrain from eating with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> who did not observe all the prescriptions of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. As he thus morally influenced the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to live as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> did, Paul demonstrated to him that this dissimulation or opportuneness prepared the way for future misunderstandings and conflicts and even then had regrettable consequences. His manner of relating this incident leaves no room for <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> was persuaded by his arguments (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs11">Galatians 2:11-20</a>).

<h4>Second mission (Acts 15:36-18:22)</h4>

<p>The beginning of the second mission was marked by a rather sharp discussion concerning <a href="../cathen/09672c.htm">Mark</a>, whom St. Paul this time refused to accept as travelling companion. Consequently <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> set out with <a href="../cathen/09672c.htm">Mark</a> for <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> and Paul chose Silas or Silvanus, a Roman citizen like himself, and an influential member of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and sent by it to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> to deliver the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> council. The two missionaries first went from <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> to <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>, stopping on the way in order to promulgate the decisions of the Council of Jerusalem; then they went from <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a> to <a href="../cathen/04738c.htm">Derbe</a>, through the Cilician Gates, the defiles of <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>, and the plains of Lycaonia. The visitation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a> founded during his first mission passed without notable incidents except the choice of <a href="../cathen/14727b.htm">Timothy</a>, whom the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> while in <a href="../cathen/09478c.htm">Lystra</a> persuaded to accompany him, and whom he <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> to be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> in order to facilitate his access to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who were numerous in those places.

<p>It was probably at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm#II">Antioch of Pisidia</a>, although the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts</a> do not mention that city, that the itinerary of the mission was altered by the intervention of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Paul thought to enter the Province of Asia by the valley of Meander which separated it by only three day's journey, but they passed through Phrygia and the country of Galatia, having been forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to preach the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia</a> (<a href="../bible/act016.htm#vrs6">Acts 16:6</a>). These words (<em>ten phrygian kai Galatiken choran</em>) are variously interpreted, according as we take them to mean the Galatians of the north or of the south (see GALATIANS). Whatever the hypothesis, the missionaries had to travel northwards in that portion of Galatia properly so called of which Pessinonte was the capital, and the only question is as to whether or not they preached there. They did not intend to do so, but as is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the evangelization of the Galatians was due to an accident, namely the illness of Paul (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#vrs13">Galatians 4:13</a>); this fits very well for Galatians in the north. In any case the missionaries having reached the upper part of Mysia (<em>kata Mysian</em>), attempted to enter the rich Province of Bithynia, which lay before them, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> prevented them (<a href="../bible/act016.htm#vrs7">Acts 16:7</a>). Therefore, passing through Mysia without stopping to preach (<em>parelthontes</em>) they reached <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> of <a href="../cathen/15063c.htm">Troas</a>, where <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will was again made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them in the vision of a Macedonian who called them to come and help his country (<a href="../bible/act016.htm#vrs9">Acts 16:9-10</a>).

<p>Paul continued to follow on <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> soil the method of preaching he had employed from the beginning. As far as possible he concentrated his efforts in a metropolis from which the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> would spread to cities of second rank and to the country districts. Wherever there was a <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> he first took his stand there and preached to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselytes</a> who would <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> to listen to him. When the rupture with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> was irreparable, which always happened sooner or later, he founded a new <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with his <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> as a nucleus. He remained in the same city until <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, generally aroused by the intrigues of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, forced him to retire. There were, however, variations of this plan. At <a href="../cathen/12007b.htm">Philippi</a>, where there was no <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, the first preaching took place in the uncovered oratory called the <em>proseuche</em>, which the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> made a reason for stirring up the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Paul and Silas, charged with disturbing public order, were beaten with rods, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, and finally exiled. But at <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a> and Berea, whither they successively repaired after leaving <a href="../cathen/12007b.htm">Philippi</a>, things turned out almost as they had planned.

<p>The apostolate of <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athens</a> was quite exceptional. Here there was no question of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, Paul, contrary to his custom, was alone (<a href="../bible/1th003.htm#vrs1">1 Thessalonians 3:1</a>), and he delivered before the areopagus a specially framed discourse, a synopsis of which has been preserved by <a href="../bible/act017.htm#vrs23">Acts 17:23-31</a> as a specimen of its kind. He seems to have left the city of his own accord, without being forced to do so by <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. The mission to <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> on the other hand may be considered typical. Paul preached in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> every <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>, and when the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> opposition of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> denied him entrance there he withdrew to an adjoining house which was the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of a <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselyte</a> named Titus Justus. He carried on his apostolate in this manner for eighteen months, while the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> vainly stormed against him; he was able to withstand them owing to the impartial, if not actually favourable, attitude of the proconsul, Gallio. Finally he decided to go to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in fulfillment of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> made perhaps in a moment of danger. From <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, according to his custom, he returned to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. The two <a href="../cathen/14629d.htm">Epistles to the Thessalonians</a> were written during the early months of his sojourn at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>. For occasion, circumstances, and <a href="../cathen/01450a.htm">analysis</a> of these letters see <a href="../cathen/14629d.htm">THESSALONIANS</a>.

<h4>Third mission (Acts 18:23-21:26)</h4>

<p>Paul's destination in his third journey was obviously Ephesus. There <a href="../cathen/01661b.htm">Aquila and Priscilla</a> were awaiting him, he had promised the Ephesians to return and evangelize them if it were the will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/act018.htm#vrs19">Acts 18:19-21</a>), and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> no longer opposed his entry into <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. Therefore, after a brief rest at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> he went through the countries of Galatia and Phrygia (<a href="../bible/act018.htm#vrs23">Acts 18:23</a>) and passing through "the upper regions" of Central Asia he reached Ephesus (<a href="../bible/act019.htm#vrs1">19:1</a>). His method remained the same. In order to earn his living and not be a burden to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> he toiled every day for many hours at making tents, but this did not prevent him from preaching the Gospel. As usual he began with the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> where he succeeded in remaining for three months. At the end of this <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> he taught every day in a classroom placed at his disposal by a certain Tyrannus "from the fifth hour to the tenth" (from eleven in the morning till four in the afternoon), according to the interesting addition of the <a href="../cathen/04083a.htm">"Codex Bezae"</a> (<a href="../bible/act019.htm#vrs9">Acts 19:9</a>). This lasted two years, so that all the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Greeks, heard the word of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/act019.htm#vrs20">Acts 19:20</a>).

<p>Naturally there were trials to be endured and obstacles to be overcome. Some of these obstacles arose from the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">jealousy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who vainly endeavoured to imitate Paul's <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcisms</a>, others from the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, which was especially rife at Ephesus. So effectually did he triumph over it, however, that books of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> were burned to the value of 50,000 pieces of silver (each piece about a day's wage). This time the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was due to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and inspired by a motive of self-interest. The progress of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> having ruined the sale of the little facsimiles of the temple of Diana and statuettes of the goddess, which devout <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> had been wont to purchase, a certain <a href="../cathen/04707a.htm#III">Demetrius</a>, at the head of the <a href="../cathen/07066c.htm">guild</a> of silversmiths, stirred up the crowd against Paul. The scene which then transpired in the <a href="../cathen/14559a.htm">theatre</a> is described by <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">St. Luke</a> with memorable vividness and pathos (<a href="../bible/act019.htm#vrs23">Acts 19:23-40</a>). The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> had to yield to the storm. After a stay at Ephesus of two years and a half, perhaps more (<a href="../bible/act020.htm#vrs31">Acts 20:31</a>: <em>trietian</em>), he departed for <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a> and thence for <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, where he spent the winter. It was his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> in the following spring to go by sea to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, doubtless for the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a>; but learning that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had planned his destruction, he did not wish, by going to sea, to afford them an opportunity to attempt his life. Therefore he returned by way of <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>. Numerous <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> divided into two groups, accompanied him or awaited him at <a href="../cathen/15063c.htm">Troas</a>. These were Sopater of Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, Gaius of <a href="../cathen/04738c.htm">Derbe</a>, <a href="../cathen/14727b.htm">Timothy</a>, <a href="../cathen/15106c.htm">Tychicus</a> and Trophimus of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, and finally <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">Luke</a>, the historian of the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts</a>, who gives us minutely all the stages of the voyage: <a href="../cathen/12007b.htm">Philippi</a>, <a href="../cathen/15063c.htm">Troas</a>, Assos, <a href="../cathen/10407a.htm">Mitylene</a>, <a href="../cathen/03689b.htm">Chios</a>, <a href="../cathen/13421c.htm">Samos</a>, <a href="../cathen/10303c.htm">Miletus</a>, Cos, <a href="../cathen/13024b.htm">Rhodes</a>, <a href="../cathen/11541a.htm">Patara</a>, <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, <a href="../cathen/12553b.htm">Ptolemais</a>, <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">Caesarea</a>, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.

<p>Three more remarkable facts should be noted in passing. At <a href="../cathen/15063c.htm">Troas</a> Paul resuscitated the young Eutychus, who had fallen from a third-story window while Paul was preaching late into the night. At <a href="../cathen/10303c.htm">Miletus</a> he pronounced before the ancients of Ephesus the touching farewell discourse which drew many tears (<a href="../bible/act020.htm#vrs18">Acts 20:18-38</a>). At <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">Caesarea</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> by the mouth of <a href="../cathen/01200a.htm">Agabus</a>, predicted his coming arrest, but did not dissuade him from going to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.

<p>St. Paul's four great <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> were written during this third mission: the <a href="../bible/1co000.htm">first to the Corinthians</a> from Ephesus, about the time of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a> prior to his departure from that city; the <a href="../bible/2co000.htm">second to the Corinthians</a> from <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>, during the summer or autumn of the same year; that to the <a href="../bible/rom000.htm">Romans</a> from <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, in the following spring; the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the <a href="../bible/gal000.htm">Epistle to the Galatians</a> is disputed. On the many questions occasioned by the despatch and the language of these letters, or the situation assumed either on the side of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> or his correspondents, see <a href="../cathen/04364a.htm">EPISTLES TO THE CORINTHIANS</a>; <a href="../cathen/06336a.htm">EPISTLE TO THE GALATIANS</a>; <a href="../cathen/13156a.htm">EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS</a>.
<h3 id="D">Captivity (Acts 21:27-28:31)</h3>

<p>Falsely accused by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of having brought <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple</a>, Paul was ill-treated by the populace and led in chains to the fortress Antonia by the tribune Lysias. The latter having learned that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had conspired treacherously to slay the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> sent him under strong escort to <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">Caesarea</a>, which was the residence of the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> Felix. Paul had little difficulty in confounding his accusers, but as he refused to purchase his liberty. Felix kept him in chains for two years and even left him in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> in order to please the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, until the arrival of his successor, Festus. The new governor wished to send the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> there to be tried in the presence of his accusers; but Paul, who was acquainted with the snares of his enemies, appealed to Caesar. Thenceforth his cause could be tried only at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This first period of captivity is characterized by five discourses of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a>: The first was delivered in <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> on the steps of the Antonia before the threatening crowd; herein Paul relates his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> and <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">vocation</a> to the Apostolate, but he was interrupted by the hostile shouts of the multitude (<a href="../bible/act022.htm#vrs1">Acts 22:1-22</a>). In the second, delivered the next day, before the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a> assembled at the command of Lysias, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> skillfully embroiled the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> with the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> and no accusation could be brought. In the third, Paul, answering his accuser Tertullus in the presence of the Governor Felix, makes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the facts which had been distorted and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proves</a> his innocence (<a href="../bible/act024.htm#vrs10">Acts 24:10-21</a>). The fourth discourse is merely an explanatory summary of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> delivered before Felix and his wife <a href="../cathen/05165b.htm">Drusilla</a> (<a href="../bible/act024.htm#vrs24">Acts 24:24-25</a>). The fifth, pronounced before the Governor Festus, <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#IV">King Agrippa</a>, and his wife Berenice, again relates the history of Paul's <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>, and is left unfinished owing to the sarcastic interruptions of the governor and the embarrassed attitude of the king (<a href="../bible/act026.htm">Acts 26</a>).

<p>The journey of the captive Paul from <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">Caesarea</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is described by <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">St. Luke</a> with an exactness and vividness of colours which leave nothing to be desired. For commentaries see Smith, "Voyage and Shipwreck of St. Paul" (1866); Ramsay, "St. Paul the Traveller and Roman Citizen" (London, 1908). The <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a> Julius had shipped Paul and his fellow-prisoners on a merchant vessel on board which <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">Luke</a> and Aristarchus were able to take passage. As the season was advanced the voyage was slow and difficult. They skirted the coasts of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Cilicia, and Pamphylia. At <a href="../cathen/10661a.htm">Myra in Lycia</a> the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> were transferred to an Alexandrian vessel bound for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, but the winds being persistently contrary a place in Crete called Goodhavens was reached with great difficulty and Paul advised that they should spend the winter there, but his advice was not followed, and the vessel driven by the tempest drifted aimlessly for fourteen whole days, being finally wrecked on the coast of <a href="../cathen/09574a.htm">Malta</a>. The three months during which navigation was considered most dangerous were spent there, but with the first days of spring all haste was made to resume the voyage. Paul must have reached <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> some time in March. "He remained two whole years in his own hired lodging . . . preaching the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> and teaching the things which concern the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, with all confidence, without prohibition" (<a href="../bible/act028.htm#vrs30">Acts 28:30-31</a>). With these words the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> conclude.

<p>There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that Paul's trial terminated in a sentence of acquittal, for

<ul>
<li>the report of the Governor Festus was certainly favourable as well as that of the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a>.
<li>The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> seem to have abandoned their charge since their co-religionists in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were not informed of it (<a href="../bible/act028.htm#vrs21">Acts 28:21</a>).
<li>The course of the proceedings led Paul to hope for a release, of which he sometimes speaks as of a <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> (<a href="../bible/phi001.htm#vrs25">Philippians 1:25</a>; <a href="../bible/phi002.htm#vrs24">2:24</a>; <a href="../bible/phm001.htm#vrs22">Philemon 22</a>).
<li>The pastorals, if they are <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authentic</a>, assume a period of activity for Paul subsequent to his captivity. The same conclusion is drawn from the hypothesis that they are not <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authentic</a>, for all agree that the author was well acquainted with the life of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a>. It is the almost unanimous opinion that the so-called <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of the captivity were sent from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Some authors have attempted to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that St. Paul wrote them during his detention at <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">Caesarea</a>, but they have found few to agree with them. The <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> to the <a href="../bible/col000.htm">Colossians</a>, the <a href="../bible/eph000.htm">Ephesians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11797b.htm">Philemon</a> were despatched together and by the same messenger, <a href="../cathen/15106c.htm">Tychicus</a>. It is a matter of controversy whether the <a href="../cathen/12008a.htm">Epistle to the Philippians</a> was prior or subsequent to these, and the question has not been answered by decisive arguments (see <a href="../cathen/12008a.htm">EPISTLE TO THE PHILIPPIANS</a>; <a href="../cathen/05485a.htm">EPISTLE TO THE EPHESIANS</a>; <a href="../cathen/04131b.htm">EPISTLE TO THE COLOSSIANS</a>; <a href="../cathen/11797b.htm">EPISTLE TO PHILEMON</a>).
</ul>

<h3 id="E">Last years</h3>

<p>This period is wrapped in deep obscurity for, lacking the account of the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts</a>, we have no guide save an often uncertain tradition and the brief references of the Pastoral epistles. Paul had long cherished the desire to go to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (<a href="../bible/rom015.htm#vrs24">Romans 15:24, 28</a>) and there is no evidence that he was led to change his plan. When towards the end of his captivity he announces his coming to <a href="../cathen/11797b.htm">Philemon</a> (<a href="../bible/phm001.htm#vrs22">22</a>) and to the <a href="../bible/phi000.htm">Philippians</a> (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#vrs23">2:23-24</a>), he does not seem to regard this visit as immediate since he promises the <a href="../cathen/12008a.htm">Philippians</a> to send them a messenger as soon as he learns the issue of his trial; he therefore plans another journey before his return to the East. Finally, not to mention the later testimony of <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14574b.htm">Theodoret</a>, the well-known text of <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">St. Clement of Rome</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the "Muratorian Canon", and of the "Acta Pauli" render probable Paul's journey to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In any case he can not have remained there long, for he was in haste to revisit his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a> in the East. He may have returned from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> through southern Gaul if it was thither, as some <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> have thought, and not to Galatia, that <a href="../cathen/04484b.htm">Crescens</a> was sent later (<a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#vrs10">2 Timothy 4:10</a>). We may readily <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he afterwards kept the promise made to his friend <a href="../cathen/11797b.htm">Philemon</a> and that on this occasion he visited the churches of the valley of Lycus, <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a>, Colossus, and Hierapolis.

<p>The itinerary now becomes very uncertain, but the following facts seem indicated by the Pastorals: Paul remained in Crete exactly long enough to found there new <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, the care and organization of which he confided to his fellow-worker Titus (<a href="../bible/tit001.htm#vrs5">Titus 1:5</a>). He then went to Ephesus, and besought <a href="../cathen/14727b.htm">Timothy</a>, who was already there, to remain until his return while he proceeded to <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a> (<a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#vrs3">1 Timothy 1:3</a>). On this occasion he paid his promised visit to the <a href="../cathen/12008a.htm">Philippians</a> (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#vrs24">Philippians 2:24</a>), and naturally also saw the <a href="../cathen/14629d.htm">Thessalonians</a>. The <a href="../bible/tit000.htm">letter to Titus</a> and the <a href="../bible/1ti000.htm">First Epistle to Timothy</a> must <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> from this period; they seem to have been written about the same <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> and shortly after the departure from Ephesus. The question is whether they were sent from <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a> or, which seems more probable, from <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> instructs Titus to join him at <a href="../cathen/11071a.htm">Nicopolis of Epirus</a> where he intends to spend the winter (<a href="../bible/tit003.htm#vrs12">Titus 3:12</a>). In the following spring he must have carried out his plan to return to <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> (<a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#vrs14">1 Timothy 3:14-15</a>). Here occurred the obscure episode of his arrest, which probably took place at <a href="../cathen/15063c.htm">Troas</a>; this would explain his having left with Carpus a cloak and books which he needed (<a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#vrs13">2 Timothy 4:13</a>). He was taken from there to Ephesus, capital of the Province of Asia, where he was deserted by all those on whom he thought he could rely (<a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#vrs15">2 Timothy 1:15</a>). Being sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for trial he left Trophimus sick at <a href="../cathen/10303c.htm">Miletus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05514a.htm">Erastus</a>, another of his companions, remained at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, for what reason is not clear (<a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#vrs20">2 Timothy 4:20</a>). When Paul wrote his <a href="../bible/2ti000.htm">Second Epistle to Timothy</a> from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he felt that all human hope was lost (<a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#vrs6">4:6</a>); he begs his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> to rejoin him as quickly as possible, for he is alone with Luke. We do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> if <a href="../cathen/14727b.htm">Timothy</a> was able to reach <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> before the death of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a>.

<p>Ancient <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> makes it possible to establish the following points:

<ul>
<li>Paul suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> near <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at a place called Aquae Salviae (now Tre Fontane), somewhat east of the Ostian Way, about two miles from the splendid <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">Basilica of San Paolo fuori le mura</a> which marks his <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">burial</a> place.
<li>The <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> took place towards the end of the reign of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, in the twelfth year (<a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>), the thirteenth (<a href="../cathen/05629b.htm">Euthalius</a>), or the fourteenth (<a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>).
<li>According to the most common opinion, Paul suffered in the same year and on the same day as <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>; several <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> contend that it was on the same day but not in the same year; the oldest <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, <a href="../cathen/05010a.htm">St. Dionysius the Corinthian</a>, says only <em>kata ton auton kairon</em>, which may be translated "at the same <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>" or "about the same time".
<li>From <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> immemorial the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> Peter and Paul has been celebrated on 29 June, which is the anniversary either of their death or of the translation of their <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>.</ul>

<p>Formerly the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, after having pontificated in the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Basilica of St. Peter</a>, went with his attendants to that of St. Paul, but the distance between the two <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> (about five miles) rendered the double <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> too exhausting, especially at that season of the year. Thus arose the prevailing <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> of transferring to the next day (30 June) the Commemoration of St. Paul. The <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the Conversion of St. Paul (25 January) is of comparatively recent origin. There is reason for <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that the day was first observed to mark the translation of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Paul at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, for so it appears in the Hieronymian <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">Martyrology</a>. It is unknown to the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> (Dowden, "The Church Year and Kalendar", Cambridge, 1910, 69; cf. Duchesne, "Origines du culte chr&eacute;tien", Paris, 1898, 265-72; McClure, "Christian Worship", London, 1903, 277-81).
<h3 id="F">Physical and moral portrait of St. Paul</h3>

<p>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.18</a>) that even in his <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> there existed <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> representing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and Paul. Paul's features have been preserved in three ancient monuments:

<ul>
<li>A <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptych</a> which dates from not later than the fourth century (Lewin, "The Life and Epistles of St. Paul", 1874, frontispiece of Vol. I and Vol. II, 210).
<li>A large medallion found in the <a href="../cathen/03504a.htm">cemetery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06098b.htm">Domitilla</a>, representing the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and Paul (Op. cit., II, 411).
<li>A glass dish in the British Museum, depicting the same <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> (Farrara, "Life and Work of St. Paul", 1891, 896).</ul>

<p>We have also the concordant descriptions of the <a href="../fathers/0816.htm">"Acta Pauli et Theclae"</a>, of Pseudo-Lucian in Philopatris, of <a href="../cathen/08466c.htm">Malalas</a> (Chronogr., x), and of <a href="../cathen/11050a.htm">Nicephorus</a> (Hist. eccl., III, 37).

<p>Paul was short of stature; the Pseudo-Chrysostom calls him "the man of three cubits" (<em>anthropos tripechys</em>); he was broad-shouldered, somewhat bald, with slightly aquiline nose, closely-knit eyebrows, thick, greyish <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a>, fair complexion, and a pleasing and affable manner. He was afflicted with a malady which is difficult to diagnose (cf. Menzies, "St. Paul's Infirmity" in the "Expository Times", July and Sept., 1904), but despite this painful and humiliating infirmity (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#vrs7">2 Corinthians 12:7-9</a>; <a href="../bible/gal004.htm#vrs13">Galatians 4:13-14</a>) and although his bearing was not impressive (<a href="../bible/2co010.htm#vrs10">2 Corinthians 10:10</a>), Paul must undoubtedly have been possessed of great physical strength to have sustained so long such superhuman labours (<a href="../bible/2co011.htm#vrs23">2 Corinthians 11:23-29</a>). Pseudo-Chrysostom, "In princip. apostol. Petrum et Paulum" (in P.G., LIX, 494-95), considers that he died at the age of sixty-eight after having served the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> for thirty-five years.

<p>The moral portrait is more difficult to draw because it is full of contrasts. Its elements will be found: in Lewin, op. cit., II, xi, 410-35 (Paul's Person and Character); in Farrar, op. cit., Appendix, Excursus I; and especially in <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, "Sermons preached on Various Occasions", vii, viii.
<h2 id="section3">Theology of St. Paul</h2>
<h3 id="A">Paul and Christ</h3>

<p>This question has passed through two distinct phases. According to the principal followers of the T&uuml;bingen School, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> had but a vague <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the life and teaching of the historical <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and even disdained such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as inferior and useless. Their only support is the misinterpreted text: "Et si cognovimus secundum carnem Christum, sed nunc jam novimus" (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#vrs16">2 Corinthians 5:16</a>). The opposition noted in this text is not between the historical and the glorified <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but between the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> such as the unbelieving <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> represented Him, such perhaps as he was preached by certain <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaizers</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> as He manifested Himself in His death and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, as He had been confessed by the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> Paul. It is neither admissible nor probable that Paul would be uninterested in the life and preaching of Him, Whom he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> passionately, Whom he constantly held up for the imitation of his <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a>, and Whose <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> he boasted of having. It is incredible that he would not question on this subject eyewitnesses, such as <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a>, Silas, or the future historians of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Sts. Mark and <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">Luke</a>, with whom he was so long associated. Careful examination of this subject has brought out the three following conclusions concerning which there is now general agreement:

<ul>
<li>There are in St. Paul more allusions to the life and teachings of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> than would be suspected at first sight, and the casual way in which they are made shows that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> more on the subject than he had the occasion, or the wish to tell.
<li>These allusions are more frequent in St. Paul than the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>.
<li>From <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> times there existed a <em><a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechesis</a></em>, treating among other things the life and teachings of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and as all <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> were supposed to possess a copy it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to refer thereto save occasionally and in passing.</ul>

<p>The second phase of the question is closely connected with the first. The same <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, who maintain that Paul was indifferent to the earthly life and teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, deliberately exaggerate his originality and influence. According to them Paul was the creator of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, the founder of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the preacher of <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">asceticism</a>, the defender of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> system, the opponent of the religion of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and liberty which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came to announce to the world. If, to do him <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, he is called the second founder of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, this must be a degenerate and altered <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> since it was at least partially opposed to the primitive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Paul is thus made responsible for every antipathy to modern thought in traditional <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.

<p>This is to a great extent the origin of the "Back to Christ" movement, the strange wanderings of which we are now witnessing. The chief reason for returning to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is to escape Paul, the originator of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The cry "Zuruck zu Jesu" which has resounded in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> for thirty years, is inspired by the ulterior motive, "Los von Paulus". The problem is: Was Paul's relation to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> that of a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> to his master? or was he absolutely autodidactic, independent alike of the Gospel of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve</a>? It must be admitted that most of the papers published shed little light on the subject. However, the discussions have not been useless, for they have shown that the most characteristic Pauline doctrines, such as <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justifying</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the redeeming death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the universality of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, are in accord with the writings of the first <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, from which they were derived. Julicher in particular has pointed out that Paul's <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christology</a>, which is more exalted than that of his companions in the apostolate, was never the object of controversy, and that Paul was not <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">conscious</a> of being singular in this respect from the other heralds of the Gospel. Cf. Morgan, "Back to Christ" in "Dict. of Christ and the Gospels", I, 61-67; Sanday, "Paul", loc. cit., II, 886-92; Feine, "Jesus Christus und Paulus" (1902); Goguel, "L'ap&ocirc;tre Paul et J&eacute;sus-Christ" (Paris, 1904); Julicher, "Paulus und Jesus" (1907).
<h3 id="B">The root idea of St. Paul's theology</h3>

<p>Several modern authors consider that <a href="../cathen/14569a.htm">theodicy</a> is at the base, centre, and summit of Pauline <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. "The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is <em>theocentric</em>, not in reality anthropocentric. What is styled his <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">'metaphysics'</a> holds for Paul the immediate and sovereign fact of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as he conceives Him, is all in all to his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and heart alike" (Findlay in Hastings, "Dict. of the Bible", III, 718). Stevens begins the exposition of his "Pauline Theology" with a chapter entitled "The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". Sabatier (L'apotre Paul, 1896, 297) also considers that "the last word of Pauline <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> is: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> all in all", and he makes the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the crown of Paul's <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> edifice. But these authors have not reflected that though the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> occupies so large a place in the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a>, whose thought is deeply religious like that of all his compatriots, it is not characteristic of him, nor does it distinguish him from his companions in the apostolate nor even from contemporary <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.

<p>Many modern <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, especially among the more or less faithful followers of the T&uuml;bingen School, maintain that Paul's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is "anthropocentric", that it starts from his conception of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> inability to fulfill the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law of God</a> without the help of grace to such an extent that he is a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and must wage <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the flesh. But if this be the genesis of Paul's <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> it is astonishing that he enunciates it only in one chapter (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm">Romans 7</a>), the sense of which is controverted, so that if this chapter had not been written, or it had been lost, we would have no means of recovering the key to his teaching. However, most modern <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> now agree that St. Paul's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is Christocentric, that it is at base a soteriology, not from a subjective standpoint, according to the ancient prejudice of the founders of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> who made <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the quintessence of Paulinism, but from the objective standpoint, embracing in a wide synthesis the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and work of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Redeemer</a>. This may be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> empirically by the statement that everything in St. Paul converges towards <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, so much so, that abstracting from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> it becomes, whether taken collectively or in detail, absolutely incomprehensible. This is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> also by demonstrating that what Paul calls his Gospel is the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. This is the standpoint of the following rapid <a href="../cathen/01450a.htm">analysis</a>:
<h3 id="C">Humanity without Christ</h3>

<p>The first three chapters of the <a href="../bible/rom000.htm">Epistle to the Romans</a> shows us <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> wholly under the dominion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Neither <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> nor <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had withstood the torrent of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a> was a futile barrier because it prescribed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> without importing the strength to do it. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> arrives at this mournful conclusion: "There is no distinction [between <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a>]; for all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and do need the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#vrs22">Romans 3:22-23</a>). He subsequently leads us back to the historical <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this disorder: "By one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into this world, and by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> death; and so death passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in whom all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs12">Romans 5:12</a>). This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is obviously <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which he brought into the world is not only his personal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but a predominating <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which entered into all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and left in them the seed of death: "All <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> when <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>; all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in and with his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" (Stevens, "Pauline Theology", 129).

<p>It remains to be seen how <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, which is our lot by natural generation, manifests itself outwardly and becomes the source of actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. This Paul teaches us in <a href="../bible/rom007.htm">chapter 7</a>, where describing the contest between the Law assisted by <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> weakened by the flesh and the tendency to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, he represents <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as inevitably vanquished: "For I am delighted with the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law of God</a>, according to the inward man: But I see another <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in my members fighting against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and captivating me in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#vrs22">Romans 7:22-23</a>). This does not mean that the organism, the material substratus, is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself, as some <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the T&uuml;bingen School have claimed, for the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which was like unto ours, was exempt from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> wishes that our bodies, which are destined to <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">rise again</a>, be preserved free from stain. The relation between <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the flesh is neither inherent nor <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>; it is accidental, determined by an historical fact, and capable of disappearing through the intervention of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but it is none the less <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that it is not in our power to overcome it unaided and that fallen <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had need of a <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>.

<p>Yet <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did not abandon <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. He continued to manifest Himself through this visible world (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#vrs19">Romans 1:19-20</a>), through the light of a <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> (<a href="../bible/rom002.htm#vrs14">Romans 2:14-15</a>), and finally through His ever active and paternally benevolent Providence (<a href="../bible/act014.htm#vrs16">Acts 14:16</a>; <a href="../bible/act017.htm#vrs26">17:26</a>). Furthermore, in His untiring mercy, He "will have all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a>, and to come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>" (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#vrs4">1 Timothy 2:4</a>). This will is necessarily subsequent to <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> since it concerns <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as he is at present. According to His merciful designs <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> leads <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> step by step to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. To the <a href="../cathen/11548a.htm">Patriarchs</a>, and especially to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, He gave his free and generous promise, confirmed by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#vrs13">Romans 4:13-20</a>; <a href="../bible/gal003.htm#vrs15">Galatians 3:15-18</a>), which anticipated the Gospel. To <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> He gave His Law, the observation of which should be a means of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#vrs10">Romans 7:10</a>; <a href="../bible/rom010.htm#vrs5">10:5</a>), and which, even when violated, as it was in reality, was no less a guide leading to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#vrs24">Galatians 3:24</a>) and an instrument of mercy in the hands of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The Law was a mere interlude until such <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">humanity</a> should be ripe for a complete <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#vrs19">Galatians 3:19</a>; <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs20">Romans 5:20</a>), and thus provoked the Divine wrath (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#vrs15">Romans 4:15</a>). But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will arise from the excess of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and "the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> hath concluded all under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that the promise, by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, might be given to them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>" (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#vrs22">Galatians 3:22</a>). This would be fulfilled in the "fullness of the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>" (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#vrs4">Galatians 4:4</a>; <a href="../bible/eph001.htm#vrs10">Ephesians 1:10</a>), that is, at the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> set by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the execution of His merciful designs, when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> helplessness should have been well manifested. Then "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent his Son, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, made under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: that he might <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redeem</a> them who were under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: that we might receive the adoption of sons" (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#vrs4">Galatians 4:4</a>).
<h3 id="D">The person of the Redeemer</h3>

<p>Nearly all statements relating to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> bear either directly or indirectly on His role as a <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>. With St. Paul <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christology</a> is a function of soteriology. However broad these outlines, they show us the faithful image of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in His pre-existence, in His historical existence and in His glorified life (see F. Prat, "Th&eacute;ologie de Saint Paul").

<p><em>(1) Christ in His pre-existence</em>

<p>(a) <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is of an order superior to all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> beings (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#vrs21">Ephesians 1:21</a>); He is the Creator and Preserver of the World (<a href="../bible/col001.htm#vrs16">Colossians 1:16-17</a>); all is by Him, in Him, and for Him (<a href="../bible/col001.htm#vrs16">Colossians 1:16</a>).

<p>(b) <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the image of the invisible Father (<a href="../bible/2co004.htm#vrs4">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>; <a href="../bible/col001.htm#vrs15">Colossians 1:15</a>); He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, but unlike other sons is so in an incommunicable manner; He is the Son, the own Son, the well-Beloved, and this He has always been (<a href="../bible/2co001.htm#vrs19">2 Corinthians 1:19</a>; <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs3">Romans 8:3</a>, <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs32">8:32</a>; <a href="../bible/col001.htm#vrs13">Colossians 1:13</a>; <a href="../bible/eph001.htm#vrs6">Ephesians 1:6</a>; etc.).

<p>(c) <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the object of the <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm">doxologies</a> reserved for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#vrs18">2 Timothy 4:18</a>; <a href="../bible/rom016.htm#vrs27">Romans 16:27</a>); He is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to as the equal of the Father (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#vrs8">2 Corinthians 12:8-9</a>; <a href="../bible/rom010.htm#vrs12">Romans 10:12</a>; <a href="../bible/1co001.htm#vrs2">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>); <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are asked of Him which it is in the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone to grant, namely grace, mercy, <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#vrs7">Romans 1:7</a>; <a href="../bible/rom016.htm#vrs20">16:20</a>; <a href="../bible/1co001.htm#vrs3">1 Corinthians 1:3</a>; <a href="../bible/rom016.htm#vrs23">16:23</a>; etc. before Him every knee shall bow in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, on earth, and under the earth (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#vrs10">Philippians 2:10</a>), as every head inclines in <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoration</a> of the majesty of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Most High</a>.

<p>(d) <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> possesses all the <a href="../cathen/02062e.htm">Divine attributes</a>; He is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, since He is the "first born of every creature" and exists before all ages (<a href="../bible/col001.htm#vrs15">Colossians 1:15-17</a>); He is immutable, since He exists "in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#vrs6">Philippians 2:6</a>); He is <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, since He has the power to bring forth being from nothingness (<a href="../bible/col001.htm#vrs16">Colossians 1:16</a>); He is immense, since He fills all things with His plenitude (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#vrs10">Ephesians 4:10</a>; <a href="../bible/col002.htm#vrs10">Colossians 2:10</a>); He is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> since "the fullness of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> dwells in Him" (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#vrs9">Colossians 2:9</a>). All that is the special property of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> belongs of <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to Him; the judgment seat of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the judgment seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/rom014.htm#vrs10">Romans 14:10</a>; <a href="../bible/2co005.htm#vrs10">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>); the Gospel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the Gospel of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#vrs1">Romans 1:1</a>, <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#vrs9">1:9</a>, <a href="../bible/rom015.htm#vrs16">15:16</a>, <a href="../bible/rom015.htm#vrs19">15:19</a>, etc.); the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#vrs2">1 Corinthians 1:2</a> and <a href="../bible/rom016.htm#vrs16">Romans 16:16 sqq.</a>); the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#vrs5">Ephesians 5:5</a>), the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs9">Romans 8:9 sqq.</a>).

<p>(e) <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the one Lord (<a href="../bible/1co008.htm#vrs6">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>); He is identified with <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Jehovah</a> of the Old Covenant (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#vrs4">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>, <a href="../bible/1co010.htm#vrs9">10:9</a>; <a href="../bible/rom010.htm#vrs13">Romans 10:13</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/1co002.htm#vrs16">1 Corinthians 2:16</a>; <a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs21">9:21</a>); He is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who has purchased the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with his own blood" (<a href="../bible/act020.htm#vrs28">Acts 20:28</a>); He is our "great <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>" (<a href="../bible/tit002.htm#vrs13">Titus 2:13</a>); He is the "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> over all things" (<a href="../bible/rom009.htm#vrs5">Romans 9:5</a>), effacing by His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> transcendency the sum and substance of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things.

<p><em>(2) Jesus Christ as Man</em>

<p>The other aspect of the figure of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is drawn with no less firm a hand. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is the second <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs14">Romans 5:14</a>; <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs45">1 Corinthians 15:45-49</a>); "the mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>" (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#vrs5">1 Timothy 2:5</a>), and as such He must necessarily be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> (<em>anthropos Christos Iesous</em>). So He is the descendant of the <a href="../cathen/11548a.htm">Patriarchs</a> (<a href="../bible/rom009.htm#vrs5">Romans 9:5</a>; <a href="../bible/gal003.htm#vrs16">Galatians 3:16</a>), He is "of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, according to the flesh)" (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#vrs3">Romans 1:3</a>), "born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>" (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#vrs4">Galatians 4:4</a>), like all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; finally, He is known as a man by His appearance, which is exactly similar to that of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#vrs7">Philippians 2:7</a>), save for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which He did not and could not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#vrs21">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). When St. Paul says that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent His Son in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> flesh" (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs3">Romans 8:3</a>), he does not mean to deny the reality of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh, but excludes only <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> flesh.

<p>Nowhere does the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> explain how the union of the Divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> is accomplished in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, being content to affirm that He who was "in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" took "the form of a servant" (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#vrs6">Philippians 2:6-7</a>), or he states the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> in this laconic formula: "For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> corporeally" (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#vrs9">Colossians 2:9</a>). What we see clearly is that there is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> a single <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a> to whom are attributed, often in the same sentence, qualities proper to the Divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, to the pre-existence, the historical <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and the glorified life (<a href="../bible/col001.htm#vrs15">Colossians 1:15-19</a>; <a href="../bible/phi002.htm#vrs5">Philippians 2:5-11</a>; etc.). The <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> explanation of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> has given rise to numerous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. Denial was made of one of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, either the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> (<a href="../cathen/05070c.htm">Docetism</a>), or the Divine (<a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>), or the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> were considered to be united in a purely <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> manner so as to produce two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> (<a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>), or the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> were merged into one (<a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a>), or on pretext of uniting them in one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> mutilated either the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (<a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarianism</a>), or the Divine, according to the strange modern <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> known as <a href="../cathen/08617a.htm">Kenosis</a>.

<p>The last-mentioned requires a brief treatment, as it is based on a saying of St. Paul "Being in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . emptied himself (<em>ekenosen eauton</em>, hence <em><a href="../cathen/08617a.htm">kenosis</a></em>) taking the form of a servant" (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#vrs6">Philippians 2:6-7</a>). Contrary to the common opinion, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> applied these words not to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnate</a> <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a>. Moreover he understood the <em>communicatio idiomatus</em> as a real possession by each of the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> of the attributes of the other. According to this the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would possess the <a href="../cathen/02062e.htm">Divine attributes</a> of ubiquity, omniscience, and <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a>. There are two systems among <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, one asserting that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> stripped of these attributes (<em><a href="../cathen/08617a.htm">kenosis</a></em>), the other that they were hidden during His mortal <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> (<em>krypsis</em>).

<p>In modern times the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/08617a.htm">Kenosis</a>, while still restricted to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, has completely changed its opinions. Starting with the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that "personality" is identified with "consciousness", it is maintained that where there is only one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> there can be only one <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">consciousness</a>; but since the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">consciousness of Christ</a> was truly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">consciousness</a>, the Divine <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">consciousness</a> must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> have ceased to exist or act in Him. According to Thomasius, the theorist of the system, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was stripped, not after the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> asserted, but by the very fact of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, and what rendered possible the union of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">humanity</a> was the faculty possessed by the Divinity to limit itself both as to being and activity. The other partisans of the system express themselves in a similar manner. Gess, for instance, says that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the Divine <em>ego</em> is changed into the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <em>ego</em>. When it is objected that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is immutable, that He can neither cease to be, nor limit Himself, nor transform Himself, they reply that this reasoning is on <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysical</a> hypotheses and concepts without reality. (For the various forms of <a href="../cathen/08617a.htm">Kenosis</a> see Bruce, "The Humiliation of Christ", p. 136.)

<p>All these systems are merely variations of <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a>. Unconsciously they assume that there is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> but a single <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as there is but a single <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. According to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>, on the contrary, the union of the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> in a single <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> involves no change in the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and need involve no physical change of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the Son and is morally entitled even as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to the goods of His Father, viz. the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">immediate vision of God</a>, eternal beatitude, the state of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. He is temporarily deprived of a portion of these goods in order that he may fulfill His mission as Redeemer. This is the abasement, the annihilation, of which St. Paul speaks, but it is a totally different thing from the <a href="../cathen/08617a.htm">Kenosis</a> as described above.
<h3 id="E">The objective redemption as the work of Christ</h3>

<p>We have seen that fallen <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> being unable to arise again unaided, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His mercy sent His Son to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">save</a> him. It is an elementary and often repeated <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of St. Paul that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saves</a> us through the Cross, that we are "<a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justified</a> by His blood", that "we were reconciled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the death of his Son" (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs9">Romans 5:9-10</a>). What endowed the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, His death, His Cross, with this redeeming <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>? Paul never answers this question directly, but he shows us the drama of <a href="../cathen/03191a.htm">Calvary</a> under three aspects, which there is danger in separating and which are better understood when compared:

<p>(a) at one time the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is a sacrifice intended, like the sacrifice of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, to expiate <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and propitiate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Cf. Sanday and Headlam, "Romans", 91-94, "The death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> considered as a sacrifice". "It is impossible from this passage (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#vrs25">Romans 3:25</a>) to get rid of the double <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>: (1) of a sacrifice; (2) of a sacrifice which is propitiatory . . . Quite apart from this passage it is not difficult to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that these two <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of sacrifice and propitiation lie at the root of the teaching not only of St. Paul but of the New Testament generally." The double danger of this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is, first to wish to apply to the sacrifice of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> all the mode of action, real or supposed, of the imperfect <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>; and second, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is appeased by a sort of magical effect, in virtue of this sacrifice, whereas on the contrary it was He Who took the initiative of mercy, instituted the sacrifice of <a href="../cathen/03191a.htm">Calvary</a>, and endowed it with its expiatory value.

<p>(b) At another time the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is represented as a <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>, the payment of a ransom, as the result of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was delivered from all his past servitude (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#vrs20">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>; <a href="../bible/1co007.htm#vrs23">7:23</a> [<em>times egorasthete</em>]; <a href="../bible/gal003.htm#vrs13">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="../bible/gal004.htm#vrs5">4:5</a> [<em>ina tous hypo nomon exagorase</em>]; <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#vrs24">Romans 3:24</a>; <a href="../bible/1co001.htm#vrs30">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>; <a href="../bible/eph001.htm#vrs7">Ephesians 1:7, 14</a>; <a href="../bible/col001.htm#vrs14">Colossians 1:14</a> [<em>apolytrosis</em>]; <a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#vrs6">1 Timothy 2:6</a> [<em>antilytron</em>]; etc.) This <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, correct as it is, may have inconveniences if isolated or exaggerated. By carrying it beyond what was written, some of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> put forth the strange suggestion of a ransom paid by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> who held us in bondage. Another mistake is to regard the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as having a value in itself, independent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who offered it and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who accepted it for the remission of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p>(c) Often, too, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> seems to substitute Himself for us in order to undergo in our stead the chastisement for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. He suffers physical death to save us from the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> death of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and preserve us from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death. This <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of substitution <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appealed</a> so strongly to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> that they admitted quantitative equality between the sufferings really endured by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the penalties deserved by our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. They even maintained that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> underwent the penalty of loss (of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>) and the <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">malediction</a> of the Father.

<p>These are the extravagances which have cast so much discredit on the theory of subsitution. It has been rightly said that the transfer of a chastisement from one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to another is an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> and a contradiction, for the chastisement is inseparable from the fault and an undeserved chastisement is no longer a chastisement. Besides, St. Paul never said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died in our stead (<em>anti</em>), but only that he died for us (<em>hyper</em>) because of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p>In reality the three standpoints considered above are but three aspects of the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a> which, far from excluding one another, should harmonize and combine, modifying if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> all the other aspects of the problem. In the following text St. Paul assembles these various aspects with several others. We are "<a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justified</a> freely by his grace, through the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a>, that is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath proposed to be a propitiation, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in his blood, to the shewing of his [hidden] <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, for the remission of former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, through the forbearance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the shewing of his <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in this <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>; that of himself may be [known as] just, and the justifier of him, who is in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#vrs24">Romans 3:24-26</a>). Herein are designated the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>:

<ul>
<li><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> takes the initiative; it is He who offers His Son; He intends to manifest His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but is moved thereto by mercy. It is therefore incorrect or more or less inadequate to say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> and that He was only appeased by the death of His Son.
<li><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is our <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a> (<em>apolytrosis</em>), He is the instrument of expiation or propitiation (<em>ilasterion</em>), and is such by His <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">Sacrifice</a> (<em>en to autou aimati</em>), which does not resemble those of irrational animals; it derives its value from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who offers it for us to His Father through obedience and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#vrs8">Philippians 2:8</a>; <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs20">Galatians 2:20</a>).
<li><a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is not merely passive in the <a href="../cathen/14559a.htm">drama</a> of his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; he must understand the lesson which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> teaches, and appropriate by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the fruit of the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a>.</ul>
<h3 id="F">The subjective redemption</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> having once died and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">risen</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a> is completed in <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and in principle for the whole <a href="../cathen/12620b.htm">human race</a>. Each man makes it his own in fact and in act by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which, by uniting him with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, causes him to participate in His Divine life. <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, according to St. Paul, is composed of several elements; it is the submission of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of God</a>, the trusting <a href="../cathen/01006a.htm">abandonment</a> of the believer to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> Who promises him assistance; it is also an act of obedience by which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> accepts the Divine will. Such an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> has a <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> value, for it "gives <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#vrs20">Romans 4:20</a>) in the measure in which it recognizes its own helplessness. That is why "Abraham <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it was reputed to him unto <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#vrs3">Romans 4:3</a>; <a href="../bible/gal003.htm#vrs6">Galatians 3:6</a>). The spiritual children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> are likewise "<a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justified</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, without the works of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#vrs28">Romans 3:28</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs16">Galatians 2:16</a>). Hence it follows:

<ul>
<li>That <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is granted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in consideration of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.
<li>That, nevertheless, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not equivalent to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justified</a> "by grace" (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#vrs6">Romans 4:6</a>).
<li>That the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> freely granted to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> becomes his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and is inherent in him.</ul>

<p><a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> formerly asserted that the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is imputed to us, but now they are generally agreed that this argument is unscriptural and lacks the guaranty of Paul; but some, loth to base <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> on a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work (<em>ergon</em>), deny a <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> value to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and claim that <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> is but a forensic judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which alters absolutely nothing in the <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justified</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinner</a>. But this theory is untenable, for:

<ul>
<li>even admitting that "to <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justify</a>" signifies "to pronounce just", it is absurd to suppose that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> really pronounces just anyone who is not already so or who is not rendered so by the declaration itself.
<li><a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">Justification</a> is inseparable from sanctification, for the latter is "a <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> of life" (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs18">Romans 5:18</a>) and every "just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> liveth by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#vrs17">Romans 1:17</a>; <a href="../bible/gal003.htm#vrs11">Galatians 3:11</a>).
<li>By <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> we die to the "old man", our former selves; now this is impossible without beginning to live as the new man, who "according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#vrs3">Romans 6:3-5</a>; <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#vrs24">Ephesians 4:24</a>; <a href="../bible/1co001.htm#vrs30">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>; <a href="../bible/1co006.htm#vrs11">6:11</a>). We may, therefore, establish a distinction in definition and concept between <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> and sanctification, but we can neither separate them nor regard them as separate.</ul>

<h3 id="G">Moral doctrine</h3>

<p>A remarkable characteristic of Paulinism is that it connects <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a> with the subjective <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> or <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>. This is especially striking in <a href="../bible/rom006.htm">chapter 6 of the Epistle to the Romans</a>. In <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> "our old man is crucified with [<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>] that, the body of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be destroyed, to the end that we may serve <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no longer" (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#vrs6">Romans 6:6</a>). Our incorporation with the <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystical Christ</a> is not only a transformation and a metamorphosis, but a real reaction, the production of a new being, subject to new <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and consequently to new <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. To understand the extent of our <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> it is enough for us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ourselves as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and to reflect on the various relations which result from our <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> birth: that of <a href="../cathen/01148a.htm">sonship</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a>, of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, of <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystical</a> identity with our Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, of brotherly union with the other members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But this is not all. Paul says to the <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a>:

<blockquote><p>"Thanks be to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you were the servants of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but have <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> from the heart unto that form of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, into which you have been delivered. . . . But now being made free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and become servants to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end life everlasting (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#vrs17">Romans 6:17, 22</a>).</p></blockquote>

<p>By the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, its seal, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> freely makes himself the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the soldier of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will, which he accepts in advance in the measure in which it shall be manifested, becomes thenceforth his rule of conduct. Thus Paul's <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> code rests on the one hand on the positive will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, promulgated by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, and virtually accepted by the <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophyte</a> in his first <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and on the other, in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> <a href="../cathen/12714a.htm">regeneration</a> and the new relations which it produces. All Paul's commands and recommendations are merely applications of these principles.
<h3 id="H">Eschatology</h3>

<p>(1) The graphic description of the Pauline parousia (<a href="../bible/1th004.htm#vrs16">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>; <a href="../bible/2th001.htm#vrs7">2 Thessalonians 1:7-10</a>) has nearly all its main points in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> great <a href="../cathen/05528b.htm">eschatological</a> discourse (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm">Matthew 24</a>, <a href="../bible/mar013.htm">Mark 13</a>, <a href="../bible/luk021.htm">Luke 21</a>). A common characteristic of all these passages is the apparent nearness of the parousia. Paul does not assert that the coming of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> is at hand. In each of the five <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistles</a>, wherein he expresses the desire and the <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in person the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">return of Christ</a>, he at the same time considers the probability of the contrary hypothesis, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proving</a> that he had neither <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> nor <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> on the point. He knows only that the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of the lord</a> will come unexpectedly, like a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> (<a href="../bible/1th005.htm#vrs2">1 Thessalonians 5:2-3</a>), and he counsels the <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> to make themselves ready without neglecting the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of their state of life (<a href="../bible/2th003.htm#vrs6">2 Thessalonians 3:6-12</a>). Although the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will be sudden, it will be heralded by three signs:
<ul>
<li>general <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> (<a href="../bible/2th002.htm#vrs3">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>),
<li>the appearance of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> (<a href="../bible/2th002.htm#vrs3">2:3-12</a>), and
<li>the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (<a href="../bible/rom011.htm#vrs26">Romans 11:26</a>).</ul>

<p>A particular circumstance of St. Paul's preaching is that the just who shall be living at <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">Christ's second advent</a> will pass to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> without dying [<a href="../bible/1th004.htm#vrs17">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>; <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs51">1 Corinthians 15:51</a> (Greek text); <a href="../bible/2co005.htm#vrs2">2 Corinthians 5:2-5</a>].

<p>(2) Owing to the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> of the Corinthians Paul treats the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of the just at some length. He does not ignore the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinners</a>, which he affirmed before the Governor Felix (<a href="../bible/act024.htm#vrs15">Acts 24:15</a>), but he does not concern himself with it in his <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a>. When he says that "the dead who are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> shall rise first" (<em>proton</em>, <a href="../bible/1th004.htm#vrs16">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>, Greek) this "first" offsets, not another <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> transformation of the living. In like manner "the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>" of which he speaks (<em>tou telos</em>, <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs24">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>) is not the end of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, but of the present world and the beginning of a new order of things. All the arguments which he advances in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> may be reduced to three: the <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystical</a> union of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the presence within us of the Spirit of Holiness, the interior and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> conviction of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. It is evident that these arguments deal only with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of the just. In short, the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of the wicked does not come within his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> horizon. What is the condition of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the just between death and <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>? These <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> enjoy the presence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#vrs8">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>); their lot is enviable (<a href="../bible/phi001.htm#vrs23">Philippians 1:23</a>); hence it is impossible that they should be without life, activity, or <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">consciousness</a>.

<p>(3) The judgment according to St. Paul as according to the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptics</a>, is closely connected with the <em>parousia</em> and the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. They are the three acts of the same drama which constitute the Day of the Lord (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#vrs8">1 Corinthians 1:8</a>; <a href="../bible/2co001.htm#vrs14">2 Corinthians 1:14</a>; <a href="../bible/phi001.htm#vrs6">Philippians 1:6, 10</a>; <a href="../bible/phi002.htm#vrs16">2:16</a>). "For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath done, whether it be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>" (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#vrs10">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>).

<p>Two conclusions are derived from this text:

<p>(1) The judgment shall be universal, neither the good nor the wicked shall escape (<a href="../bible/rom014.htm#vrs10">Romans 14:10-12</a>), nor even the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#vrs3">1 Corinthians 6:3</a>); all who are brought to trial must account for the use of their liberty.

<p>(2) The judgment shall be according to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>: this is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> frequently reiterated by St. Paul, concerning <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinners</a> (<a href="../bible/2co011.htm#vrs15">2 Corinthians 11:15</a>), the just (<a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#vrs14">2 Timothy 4:14</a>), and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in general (<a href="../bible/rom002.htm#vrs6">Romans 2:6-9</a>). Many <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> marvel at this and claim that in St. Paul this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is a survival of his <a href="../cathen/12617b.htm">rabbinical</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> (Pfleiderer), or that he could not make it harmonize with his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of gratuitous <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> (Reuss), or that the reward will be in proportion to the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a>, as the harvest is in proportion to the sowing, but that it will not be because of or with a view to the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> (Weiss). These authors lose sight of the fact that St. Paul distinguishes between two <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justifications</a>, the first necessarily gratuitous since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was then incapable of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meriting</a> it (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#vrs28">Romans 3:28</a>; <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs16">Galatians 2:16</a>), the second in conformity to his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> (<a href="../bible/rom002.htm#vrs6">Romans 2:6</a>: <em>kata ta erga</em>), since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, when adorned with <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, is capable of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> as the sinner is of demerit. Hence the celestial recompense is "a crown of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> the just judge will render" (<a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#vrs8">2 Timothy 4:8</a>) to whomsoever has legitimately gained it.

<p>Briefly, St. Paul's <a href="../cathen/05528b.htm">eschatology</a> is not so distinctive as it has been made to appear. Perhaps its most original characteristic is the continuity between the present and the future of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, between grace and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, between <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> begun and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> consummated. A large number of terms, <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>, <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>, <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and especially <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>, are common to the two states, or rather to the two phases of the same <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> linked by charity which "never falleth away".
