<h1>St. Paul of the Cross</h1>  

<p>Paul Francis Daneii, born at Ovada, <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa, Italy</a>, 3 January, 1694; died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 18 October, 1775.

<p>His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, Luke Danei and Anna Maria Massari, were exemplary <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. From his earliest years the <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">crucifix</a> was his book, and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Crucified</a> his model. Paul received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> from a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who kept a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys, in Cremolino, <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. He made great progress in study and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; spent much time in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, heard daily <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>, frequently received the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacraments</a>, faithfully attended to his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, and gave his spare time to reading good books and visiting the churches, where he spent much time before the <a href="../cathen/15483b.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, to which he had an <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">ardent</a> <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a>. At the age of fifteen he left <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and returned to his home at Castellazzo, and from this time his life was full of trials. In early manhood he renounced the offer of an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriage</a>; also a good inheritance left him by an uncle who was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He kept for himself only the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>.

<p>Inflamed with a desire for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> he formed the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of instituting a religious order in honour of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">Vested</a> in a black <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01283d.htm">Alessandria</a>, his director, bearing the emblem of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">our Lord's Passion</a>, barefooted, and bareheaded, he retired to a narrow cell where he drew up the Rules of the new congregation according to the plan made known to him in a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a>, which he relates in the introduction to the original copy of the Rules. For the account of his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, of the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Congregation of the Passion</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the Rules, see <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">PASSIONISTS</a>. After the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the Rules and the institute the first general chapter was held at the Retreat of the Presentation on Mount Argentaro on 10 April, 1747. At this chapter, St. Paul, against his wishes, was unanimously elected first superior general, which office he held until the day of his death. In all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and in the observance of regular <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a>, he became a model to his companions. "Although continually occupied with the cares of governing his religious society, and of founding everywhere new houses for it, yet he never left off preaching the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, burning as he did with a wondrous desire for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>" (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> for St. Paul's <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">Beatification</a>, 1 Oct., 1852). Sacred missions were instituted and numerous <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversions</a> were made. He was untiring in his Apostolic labours and never, even to his last hour, remitted anything of his austere manner of life, finally succumbing to a severe illness, worn out as much by his <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">austerities</a> as by old age.

<p>Among the distinguished associates of St. Paul in the formation and extension of the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">congregation</a> were: John Baptist, his younger brother and constant companion from childhood, who shared all his labours and sufferings and equaled him in the practice of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; Father Mark Aurelius (Pastorelli), Father Thomas Struzzieri (subsequently <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01406c.htm">Amelia</a> and afterwards of <a href="../cathen/14754a.htm">Todi</a>), and Father Fulgentius of Jesus, all remarkable for learning, piety, and missionary <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>; Venerable Strambi, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09492a.htm">Macerata and Tolentino</a>, his biographer. Constant personal union with the <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">Cross</a> and <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> was the prominent feature of St. Paul's <a href="../cathen/13428b.htm">sanctity</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> did not stand alone, for he carried to a <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">heroic degree</a> all the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life. Numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, besides those special ones brought forward at his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification and canonization</a>, attested the favour he enjoyed with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">Miracles</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> abounded, as witnessed in the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of sinners seemingly hardened and hopeless. For fifty years he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and left the <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a> as a legacy to his sons. The body of St. Paul lies in the Basilica of SS. John and Paul, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> on 1 October, 1852, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> on 29 June, 1867. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> occurs on 28 April. [Editor's note: It was later transferred to 19 October.] The fame of his <a href="../cathen/13428b.htm">sanctity</a>, which had spread far and wide in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> during his life, increased after his death and spread into all countries. Great <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a> to him is practiced by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> wherever <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a> are established.
