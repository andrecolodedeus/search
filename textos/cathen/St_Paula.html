<h1>St. Paula</h1>  

<p>Born in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 347; died at <a href="../cathen/02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a>, 404. She belonged to one of the first <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Left a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> in 379 at the age of 32 she became, through the influence of St. Marcella and her group, the model of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>. In 382 took place her decisive meeting with <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, who had come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> and Paulinus of Antioch. These two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> inspired her with an invincible desire to follow the monastic life in the East. After their departure from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and at the request of Marcella, Jerome gave readings from <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> before the group of patrician <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> among whom St. Paula held a position of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. Paula was an ardent student. She and her daughter, Eustochium, studied and mastered Hebrew perfectly. By their studies they aimed not so much to acquire <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as a fuller acquaintance with <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a>.

<p>She did not, however, neglect her domestic <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. A devoted mother, she married her daughter, Paulina (d. 395), to the senator Pammachius; Blesilla soon became a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> and died in 384. Of her two other daughters, Rufina died in 386, and Eustochium accompanied her mother to the Orient where she died in 419. Her son Toxotius, at first a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>, but <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in 385, married in 389 Laeta, daughter of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Albinus. Of this marriage was born Paula the Younger, who in 404 rejoined Eustochium in the East and in 420 closed the eyes of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>. These are the names which recur frequently in the letters of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, where they are inseparable from that of Paula.

<p>The death of Blesilla and that of Pope Damasus in 384 completely changed the manner of life of Paula and Jerome. In September, 385, Paula and Eustochium left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to follow the monastic life in the East. Jerome, who had preceded them thither by a month, joined them at Antioch. Paula first made in great detail the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of all the famous places of the Holy Land, afterward going to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to be edified by the virtues of the <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a> and cenobites, and finally took up her residence at <a href="../cathen/02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a>, as did <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>. Then began for Paula, Eustochium, and Jerome their definitive manner of life. The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and spiritual intercourse among these <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, begun at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, continued and developed. Two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were founded, one for men, the other for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Paula and Eustochium took a larger share in the <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> labours of Jerome, and conformed themselves more and more to his direction. An example of their manner of thinking and writing may be seen in the letter they wrote from Bethlehem about 386 to Marcella to persuade her to leave <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and join them; it is Letter XLVI of the correspondence of Jerome. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was not sparing of trials to His servants. Their peace was disturbed by constant annoyances, first the controversy concerning <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenism</a> which disturbed their relations with John, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and later Paula's need of money, she having been ruined by her generosity. She died in the midst of these trials and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>. The chief and almost the only source of Paula's life is the correspondence of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (P.L., XXII). The Life of St. Paula is in Letter CVIII, which, though somewhat rhetorical, is a wonderful production. The other letters which specially concern St. Paula and her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> are XXII, XXX, XXXI, XXXIII, XXXVIII, XXXIX, LXVI, CVII.
