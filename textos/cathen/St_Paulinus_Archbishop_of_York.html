<h1>St. Paulinus, Archbishop of York</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, died at Rochester, 10 October, 644. He was a Roman <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in St. Andrew's <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was sent by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> in 601, with <a href="../cathen/10168b.htm">St. Mellitus</a> and others, to help <a href="../cathen/02081a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and to carry the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> to him. He laboured in Kent &#151; with the possible exception of a mission to East Anglia before 616 &#151; till 625, when he accompanied Ethelburga (Aethelburh), the sister of King Eadbald of Kent, when she went to the Northumbrian Court to marry King Edwin, then a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> (see <a href="../cathen/05323b.htm">SAINT EDWIN</a>). Before leaving Kent, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by <a href="../cathen/08586a.htm">St. Justus</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. He was successful in converting Edwin and large numbers of his people, the king's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> taking place on 12 April, 627. With the assistance of <a href="../cathen/05323b.htm">St. Edwin</a>, he established his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> at York and began to build a stone church there. His apostolic labours in instructing and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> the people of the north country were unceasing, and tradition perpetuates his ministry at Yeavering, Catterick Bridge, Dewsbury, Easingwold, Southwell, and elsewhere, while his own name is preserved in the village of Pallingsburn in Northumbria. On the defeat of <a href="../cathen/05323b.htm">St. Edwin</a> in 633, Paulinus carried the queen and her children safely to Kent; and, as the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> reaction under Penda made missionary work impossible in Northumbria, he devoted himself to the <a href="../cathen/13102a.htm">Diocese of Rochester</a>, then vacant. It was after his flight that he received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (634), sent to him as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>. Though <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> writers have disagreed among themselves as to whether he was justified in leaving his <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers, following <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede</a>, have held that he had no choice and was the best judge of what was advisable under the circumstances. <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede</a> describes him as tall and thin, with a slightly stooping figure; he had black hair and an aquiline nose and was of venerable and awe-inspiring aspect. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in his church at Rochester, and, on the rebuilding of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were translated by <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Archbishop Lanfranc</a> to a silver shrine where they lay till the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. His festival is observed in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> on 10 Oct., the <a href="../cathen/10709a.htm">anniversary of his death</a>.
