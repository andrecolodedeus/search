<h1>St. Paulinus, Bishop of Nola</h1>  

<p>(Pontius Meropius Anicius Paulinus).

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> about 354; died 22 June, 431. He sprang from a distinguished <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Aquitania and his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was entrusted to the poet Ausonius. He became governor of the Province of Campania, but he soon realized that he could not find in public life the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> he sought. From 380 to 390 he lived almost entirely in his native land. He married a Spanish lady, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> named Therasia. To her, to Bishop Delphinus of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> and his successor the Presbyter Amandus, and to <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>, who had cured him of some disease of the eye, he owed his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>. He and his brother were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at the same time by Delphinus. When Paulinus lost his only child eight days after birth, and when he was threatened with the charge of having <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> his brother, he and his wife decided to withdraw from the world, and to enter the monastic life. They went to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> about 390.

<p>At <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, 394, or 395, the inhabitants of Barcelona <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> him to be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, which was not canonical as he had not previously received the other orders. Having had a special devotion to St. Felix, who was buried at <a href="../cathen/11089b.htm">Nola</a> in Campania, he laid out a fine avenue leading to the church containing Felix's <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, and beside it he erected a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. He decided to settle down there with Therasia; and he distributed the largest part of his possessions among the poor. In 395 he removed to <a href="../cathen/11089b.htm">Nola</a>, where he led a rigorous, ascetic, and monastic life, at the same time contributing generously to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the aqueduct at <a href="../cathen/11089b.htm">Nola</a>, and the construction of <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> in <a href="../cathen/11089b.htm">Nola</a>, Fondi, etc. The basilica at <a href="../cathen/11089b.htm">Nola</a> counted five <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a> and had on each side four additions or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> (<em>cubicula</em>), and an apsis arranged in a clover shape. This was connected with the old mortuary <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Felix by a gallery. The side was richly decorated with marble, silver lamps and lustres, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, statuary, and inscriptions. In the apsis was a <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> which represented the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a>, and of which in 1512 some remnants were still found.

<p>About 409 Paulinus was chosen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11089b.htm">Nola</a>. For twenty years he discharged his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> in a most praiseworthy manner. His letters contain numerous biblical quotations and allusions; everything he performed in the Spirit of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and expressed in Biblical language. <a href="../cathen/06417a.htm">Gennadius</a> mentions the writings of Paulinus in his continuation of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> "De Viris Illustribus" (xlix). The panegyric on the <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a> is unfortunately lost, as are also the Opus sacramentorum et hymnorum", the "Epistolae ad Sororem", the "Liber de Paenitentia", the "Liber de Laude Generali Omnium Martyrum", and a poetical treatment of the "De Regibus" of Suetonius which Ausonius mentions. Forty-nine letters to friends have been preserved, as those to Sulpicius Severus, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, Delphinus, Bishop Victricius of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, Desiderius, Amandus, Pammachius, etc. Thirty-three poems are also extant. After 395 he composed annually a <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> for the feast of St. Felix, in which he principally glorified the life, works, and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of his holy patron. Then going further back he brought in various religious and poetic motives. The epic parts are very vivid, the lyrics full of real, unaffected enthusiasm and an ardent appreciation of nature. Thirteen of these poems and fragments of the fourteenth have preserved.

<p>Conspicuous among his other works are the poetic epistles to Ausonius, the nuptial <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> to Julianus, which extols the dignity and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Christian marriage</a>, and the poem of comfort to the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of Celsus on the death of their child. Although Paulinus has great versatility and nicety, still he is not entirely free from the mannerisms and ornate culture of his period. All his writings breathe a charming, ideal <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, freed from all terrestrial attachments, ever striving upward. According to Augustine, he also had an exaggerated <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> concerning the veneration of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. His letter xxxii, written to Sulpicius Severus, has received special attention because in it he describes the basilica of <a href="../cathen/11089b.htm">Nola</a>, which he built, and gives copious accounts of the existence, construction, and purpose of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> monuments. From Paulinus too we have information concerning St. Peter's in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. During his lifetime Paulinus was looked upon as saint. His body was first <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/11089b.htm">Nola</a>; later, in <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>; then it was conveyed by <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> to S. Bartolomeo all'Isola, in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and finally in compliance with the regulation of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> of 18 Sept., 1908 (Acta Apostolicae Sedis, I, 245 sq.) was restored to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/11089b.htm">Nola</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a>, 22 June, was raised to the rank of a double.
