<h1>St. Paulinus II, Patriarch of Aquileia</h1>  

<p>Born at Premariacco, near Cividale, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, about 730-40; died 802. Born probably of a Roman <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> during Longobardic rule in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, he was brought up in the patriarchal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at Cividale. After <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> he became master of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. He acquired a thorough Latin culture, <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. He had also a deep <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>, and extensive Scriptural, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, and patristic training. This learning won him the favour of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. After the destruction of the Kingdom of the Longobards in 774, Charles invited Paulinus to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 776, to be royal master of grammar". He assisted in restoring civilization in the West. In 777 Paulinus made his first acquaintance with Petrus of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, Arno, Albrico, <a href="../cathen/02645b.htm">Bona</a>, Riculph, Raefgot, Rado, Lullus, Bassinus, Fuldrad, <a href="../cathen/05366b.htm">Eginard</a>, Adalard, and Adelbert, the leading men of that age. His devotion to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> was rewarded by many favours, among them the gift of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of Waldand, son of Mimo of Lavariano, with a diploma dated from <a href="../cathen/08258a.htm">Ivrea</a>, and his appointment by Charles as <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> in 787. Paulinus took a prominent part in the important matters of his day. In his relations with the churches of Istria, or with the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Grado, the representative of Byzantine interests, he showed the greatest <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and pastoral <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. Paulinus obtained diplomas for the free election of the future <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, and other privileges for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, viz. the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Mary in Organo, the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Laurence of Buia, the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> of St. John at Cividale and St. Mary at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>. He helped in preparing the new Christian legislation, and we find some canons of his <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. In 792 he was present at the Council of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, which condemned the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/01150a.htm">Adoptionism</a> taught by Eliphand and Felix, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15223b.htm">Urgel</a>. In 794 he took a leading part in the <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national Synod</a> of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort-on-the-Main</a>, where <a href="../cathen/01150a.htm">Adoptionism</a> was again condemned, and wrote a book against it which was sent to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in the name of the council. Leaving Frankfort Paulinus paid a visit to Cividale and accompanied Pepin against the Avars. At Salzburg he presided over a synod of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, in which were discussed the evangelization of the barbarians, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, as we learn from letters of Charles, <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, Arno, and Paulinus. Returning from the expedition the patriarch once more opposed the Adoptionists at the Synod of Cividale in 796. Paulinus expounded the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> about the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a>, especially about the procession of the Holy Ghost from the Father and the Son. At this synod fourteen "canons" on <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>, and on the sacrament of marriage, were framed and a copy of the Acts was sent to the emperor. Paulinus is said to have assisted at the Council of Altinum, but Hefele has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that a council was never held there. In 798 he was "Missus Dominicus" of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> at Pistoia, with Arno and ten other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; and afterwards he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as imperial <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>. The activity of Paulinus as <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> is clear from the "Sponsio Episcoporum ad S. Aquileiensem Sedem . Among his works are: Libellus Sacrosyllabus contra Elipandum ; Libri III contra Felicem ; the protocol of the conference with Pepin and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> on the Danube, a work very important for the history of that expedition. Paulinus was also a poet, and we till possess some of his poetical productions: "Carmen de regula fidei ; the rhythmus or elegy for the death of his friend, Duke Heric, killed in battle, 799; another rhythm on the destruction of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>; eight rhythms or <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> to be sung in his own church for <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, the Purification, <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, St. Mark, Sts. Peter and Paul, the dedication, and "Versus de Lazaro". He died revered as a saint. In <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> prior to the Martyrology of Usuard his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is recorded on 11 Jan. In the <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">calendars</a> of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, used in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> and Cividale, his feast has a special <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a>. The first appearance of the name St. Paulinus in the Liturgy occurs in the "Litaniae" of Charles the Bald of the ninth century. It appears also in the "Litaniae Carolinae", in the "Litaniae a S. Patribus constitutae", and finally in the Litaniae" of the Gertrudian <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the tenth century. Down to the sixteenth century the feast was celebrated on 11 Jan., during the privileged octave of the Epiphany. The patriarch Francesco Barbaro at the beginning of the seventeenth century translated the feast to 9 Feb. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Cividale keeps his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> on 2 March. After several translations the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the saintly patriarch were laid to rest under the altar of the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of the basilica of Cividale del Friuli.
