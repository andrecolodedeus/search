<h1>St. Peter-Louis-Marie Chanel</h1>  

<p><em>The print version of the</em> C<font size=-2>ATHOLIC</font> E<font size=-2>NCYCLOPEDIA</font> <em>contains two articles on this saint. We reproduce both articles here.</em>

<h2>Article by Joseph Freri (from Volume 11)</h2>

<p>Born at Cuet, <a href="../cathen/02415a.htm">Diocese of Belley</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 1802; died at Futuna, 28 April, 1841. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1827, and engaged in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> ministry for a few years; but the reading of letters of missionaries in far-away lands inflamed his heart with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and he resolved to devoted his life to the Apostolate. In 1831 he joined the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Society of Mary</a>, and in 1836 he embarked for Oceania. He was assigned by his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to the Island of Futuna, and landed in Nov., 1837. No <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missionary had ever set foot there, and the difficulties Peter encountered amidst those savage tribes were almost incredible. Nevertheless, he was beginning to see the results of his efforts, when Niuluki, king and also pontiff of the island, already jealous of the progress of the new religion, was exasperated by the conversion of his son and daughter. At his instigation, one of the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> gathered some of the enemies of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and Peter was cruelly assassinated without uttering a word of complaint. Through his death, the venerable <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> obtained what he had so ardently desired and earnestly worked for, the conversion of Futuna. In 1842, two Marist missionaries resumed his work, and nowhere has the preaching of the Gospel produced more wonderful results. Peter was declared Venerable by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1857, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> on 17 November, 1889.

<h2>Article by J.P. Sollier (from Volume 3)</h2>

<p>Proto-martyr of Oceanica, born at Cuet, dep. of Ain, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 1803, died at Futuna, Friendly Islands, Oceanica, 28 April, 1841. Being of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> parentage, a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, M. Trompier, assisted his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1827, he went as <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> to Amb&eacute;rieux and later as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> to Crozet. His desire to serve in the foreign missions drew him, in 1831, into the newly-founded <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Society of Mary</a> which, having been formally approved, 29 April, 1836, was entrusted with the evangelization of Occidental Oceanica. Chanel, after taking the three religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> at the hands of <a href="../cathen/04101a.htm">Father Colin</a>, founder and first superior of the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a>, embarked that same year for his distant mission under the leadership of Bishop Bataillon, and was sent to the island called Horn, or Allofatu, by geographers, and Futuna by the natives. War between rival tribes and the practice of cannibalism had reduced its population to a few thousands when Chanel landed on its shores. The religion he found there was a worship of terror offered to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a>. Chanel laboured faithfully amid the greatest hardships, learning the native language, attending the sick, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> the dying, and winning from all the name of "the man with the kind heart". Niuliki, the then ruler, showed first an amicable disposition towards the missionary and even declared him "taboo", or sacred and inviolable; but when he saw that his subjects were being drawn away from the idols into the white man's religion, he issued an edict against him to avert the movement towards <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. At that very time his son Meitala joined the missionary.

<p>Musumusu, Niuliki's prime minister and an implacable enemy of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, then concocted a plot with the petty chiefs against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, which was carried out with great cruelty. At day-break, on 28 April, 1841, the conspirators assembled together and, after wounding many <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> whom they had surprised sleeping, proceeded to Chanel's hut. One shattered his arm and wounded his left temple with a war-club. Another struck him to the ground with a bayonet. A third beat him severely with a club. The missionary was uttering the while words of gentle resignation: "Malie fuai" (it is: well for me). Musumusu himself, enraged at the tardiness of death, split open the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> skull with an adze. The remains of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> missionary, hurriedly buried, were later claimed by M. Lavaux, commander of the French naval station of Tahiti, and taken to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> on a government transport, 1842. The cause of the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> of Father Chanel, introduced 1857, terminated by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Quemadmodum" of 16 Nov., 1889. The solemnities took place the following day in the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">basilica of St. Peter</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. "Oceanic&aelig; protomartyr" is the official title given Blessed Chanel by the Congregation of Rites in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> declaring: "tuto procedi posse ad solemnem Ven. servi Dei P. M. Chanel beatificationem".

<p>[<em>Note:</em> Peter Chanel, the proto-martyr of the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Society of Mary</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/11200b.htm">Oceania</a>, was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1954 by Pope Pius XII.]
