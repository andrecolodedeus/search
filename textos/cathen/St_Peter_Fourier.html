<h1>St. Peter Fourier</h1>  

<p>Known as LE BON P&Egrave;RE DE MATTAINCOURT, born at Mirecourt, <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, 30 Nov., 1565 died at Gray, Haute-Sa&ocirc;ne, 9 Dec., 1640. At fifteen he was sent to the University of Pont-&agrave;-Mousson. His <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and learning led many noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> to ask him to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educate</a> their sons. He became a <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canon Regular</a> in the Abbey of Chaumousey and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1589. By order of his <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> he returned to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and became proficient in patristic <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>; he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../summa/index.html">"Summa"</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> by heart. In 1597 he was made <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Mattaincourt, a corrupt district threatened with the new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. By his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, instructions, and good example, religion was soon restored. Fourier did not neglect the temporal interests of his parishioners; to help those who through ill-fortune had fallen into poverty, he established a kind of mutual help bank. He instituted three sodalities, of St. Sebastian for men, of the <a href="../cathen/13188b.htm">Holy Rosary</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and of the Immaculate Conception for girls, or "Children of Mary". He composed some dialogues which treated of the virtues opposed to the vices most common among his people. These dialogues the children delivered every <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> in public. To perpetuate his work, Peter founded in 1598 an order of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, the Congregation of Notre-Dame, who teach poor girls gratuitously. The institute spread and with some modifications was introduced into America by the Ven. Marguerite Bourgeoys (died 1700).

<p>In 1621, by order of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Toul, Fourier undertook the reform of the canons regular in Lorraine who in 1629 formed the Congregation of Our Saviour. Of this congregation he was made superior general in 1632. He wished his brother canons to do for boys what his <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> were doing for girls. In 1625 Peter was entrusted with the conversion of the Principality of Salm, near <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a>, which had gone over to <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>. In six months all the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, whom he called "poor strangers", had returned to the Faith, On account of his attachment to the House of Lorraine he was driven into exile at Gray, where he died. In 1730 <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> published the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of his Beatification, and <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> him in 1897.
