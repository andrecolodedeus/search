<h2 id="i">Until the Ascension of Christ</h2>
<h3>Bethsaida</h3>

<p>St. Peter's <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and original name was Simon, sometimes occurring in the form <em>Symeon</em>. (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs14">Acts 15:14</a>; <a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#vrs1">2 Peter 1:1</a>). He was the son of Jona (Johannes) and was born in <a href="../cathen/02536a.htm">Bethsaida</a> (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs42">John 1:42, 44</a>), a town on <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">Lake Genesareth</a>, the position of which cannot be established with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, although it is usually sought at the northern end of the lake. The <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Apostle Andrew</a> was his brother, and the <a href="../cathen/11799a.htm">Apostle Philip</a> came from the same town.
<h3>Capharnaum</h3>

<p>Simon settled in <a href="../cathen/03309a.htm">Capharnaum</a>, where he was living with his mother-in-law in his own house (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm#vrs14">Matthew 8:14</a>; <a href="../bible/luk004.htm#vrs38">Luke 4:38</a>) at the beginning of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> public ministry (about A.D. 26-28). Simon was thus married, and, according to <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (Stromata, III, vi, ed. Dindorf, II, 276), had children. The same writer relates the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> that Peter's wife suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> (ibid., VII, xi ed. cit., III, 306). Concerning these facts, adopted by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.31</a>) from <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement</a>, the ancient <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature which has come down to us is silent. Simon pursued in <a href="../cathen/03309a.htm">Capharnaum</a> the profitable occupation of fisherman in <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">Lake Genesareth</a>, possessing his own boat (<a href="../bible/luk005.htm#vrs3">Luke 5:3</a>).
<h3>Peter meets Our Lord</h3>

<p>Like so many of his <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> contemporaries, he was attracted by the <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">Baptist's</a> preaching of <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> and was, with his brother <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Andrew</a>, among <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John's</a> associates in <a href="../cathen/02532a.htm">Bethania</a> on the eastern bank of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>. When, after the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">High Council</a> had sent envoys for the second time to the <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">Baptist</a>, the latter pointed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> who was passing, saying, "Behold the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">Lamb of God</a>", <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Andrew</a> and another <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> followed the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> to his residence and remained with Him one day.

<p>Later, meeting his brother Simon, <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Andrew</a> said "We have found the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>", and brought him to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, who, looking upon him, said: "Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is interpreted Peter". Already, at this first meeting, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> foretold the change of Simon's name to Cephas (<em>Kephas</em>; Aramaic <em>Kipha</em>, rock), which is translated <em>Petros</em> (Latin, <em>Petrus</em>) a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had already special views with regard to Simon. Later, probably at the time of his definitive call to the Apostolate with the eleven other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> actually gave Simon the name of Cephas (<em>Petrus</em>), after which he was usually called Peter, especially by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> on the solemn occasion after Peter's profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs18">Matthew 16:18</a>; cf. below). The <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> often combine the two names, while <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> uses the name Cephas.
<h3>Peter becomes a disciple</h3>

<p>After the first meeting Peter with the other early <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> remained with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> for some time, accompanying Him to <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> (Marriage at <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a>), <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judaea</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and through <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> back to <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> (<a href="../bible/joh002.htm">John 2-4</a>). Here Peter resumed his occupation of fisherman for a short <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, but soon received the definitive call of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> to become one of His permanent <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. Peter and <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Andrew</a> were engaged at their calling when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> met and addressed them: "Come ye after me, and I will make you to be fishers of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>". On the same occasion the sons of Zebedee were called (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#vrs18">Matthew 4:18-22</a>; <a href="../bible/mar001.htm#vrs16">Mark 1:16-20</a>; <a href="../bible/luk005.htm#vrs1">Luke 5:1-11</a>; it is here assumed that <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">Luke</a> refers to the same occasion as the other <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>). Thenceforth Peter remained always in the immediate neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>. After preaching the Sermon on the Mount and curing the son of the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a> in <a href="../cathen/03309a.htm">Capharnaum</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> came to Peter's house and cured his wife's mother, who was sick of a fever (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm#vrs14">Matthew 8:14-15</a>; <a href="../bible/mar001.htm#vrs29">Mark 1:29-31</a>). A little later <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> chose His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve Apostles</a> as His constant associates in preaching the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.
<h3>Growing prominence among the Twelve</h3>

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve</a> Peter soon became conspicuous. Though of irresolute <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>, he clings with the greatest fidelity, firmness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and inward <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>; rash alike in word and act, he is full of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and enthusiasm, though momentarily easily accessible to external influences and intimidated by difficulties. The more prominent the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> become in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Evangelical narrative</a>, the more conspicuous does Peter appear as the first among them. In the list of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve</a> on the occasion of their solemn call to the Apostolate, not only does Peter stand always at their head, but the surname <em>Petrus</em> given him by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is especially emphasized (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs2">Matthew 10:2</a>): "Duodecim autem Apostolorum nomina haec: Primus Simon qui dicitur Petrus. . ."; <a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs14">Mark 3:14-16</a>: "Et fecit ut essent duodecim cum illo, et ut mitteret eos praedicare . . . et imposuit Simoni nomen Petrus"; <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#vrs13">Luke 6:13-14</a>: "Et cum dies factus esset, vocavit discipulos suos, et elegit duodecim ex ipsis (quos et Apostolos nominavit): Simonem, quem cognominavit Petrum . . ." On various occasions Peter speaks in the name of the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm#vrs15">Matthew 15:15</a>; <a href="../bible/mat019.htm#vrs27">19:27</a>; <a href="../bible/luk012.htm#vrs41">Luke 12:41</a>, etc.). When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words are addressed to all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, Peter answers in their name (e.g., <a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs16">Matthew 16:16</a>). Frequently the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> turns specially to Peter (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs40">Matthew 26:40</a>; <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#vrs31">Luke 22:31</a>, etc.).

<p>Very characteristic is the expression of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> fidelity to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, which Peter addressed to Him in the name of the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, after He had spoken of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the reception of His Body and Blood (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#vrs22">John 6:22 sqq.</a>) and many of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> had left Him, asked the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve</a> if they too should leave Him; Peter's answer comes immediately: "Lord to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>. And we have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, that thou art the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Holy One of God</a>" (<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> "thou art the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>"). <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself unmistakably accords Peter a special precedence and the first place among the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, and designates him for such on various occasions. Peter was one of the three <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> (with James and John) who were with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> on certain special occasions the raising of the daughter of Jairus from the dead (<a href="../bible/mar005.htm#vrs37">Mark 5:37</a>; <a href="../bible/luk008.htm#vrs51">Luke 8:51</a>); the <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">Transfiguration</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/mat017.htm#vrs1">Matthew 17:1</a>; <a href="../bible/mar009.htm#vrs1">Mark 9:1</a>; <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#vrs28">Luke 9:28</a>), the <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">Agony</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06540a.htm">Garden of Gethsemani</a> (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs37">Matthew 26:37</a>; <a href="../bible/mar014.htm#vrs33">Mark 14:33</a>). On several occasions also <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> favoured him above all the others; He enters Peter's boat on <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">Lake Genesareth</a> to preach to the multitude on the shore (<a href="../bible/luk005.htm#vrs3">Luke 5:3</a>); when He was <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> walking upon the waters, He called Peter to come to Him across the lake (<a href="../bible/mat014.htm#vrs28">Matthew 14:28 sqq.</a>); He sent him to the lake to catch the fish in whose mouth Peter found the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">stater</a> to pay as tribute (<a href="../bible/mat017.htm#vrs24">Matthew 17:24 sqq.</a>).

<h3>Peter becomes head of the apostles</h3>

<p>In especially solemn fashion <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> accentuated Peter's precedence among the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, when, after Peter had recognized Him as the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, He promised that he would be head of His flock. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was then dwelling with His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> in the vicinity of <a href="../cathen/03135a.htm">Caesarea Philippi</a>, engaged on His work of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. As <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming agreed so little in power and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> with the expectations of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, many different views concerning Him were current. While journeying along with His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> asks them: "Whom do men say that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> is?" The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> answered: "Some <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>, and other some <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>, and others <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a>, or one of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>". <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: "But whom do you say that I am?" Simon said: "Thou art <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of the living God</a>". And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering said to him: "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona: because flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. And I say to thee: That thou art Peter [Kipha, a rock], and upon this rock [Kipha] I will build my <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> [ekklesian], and the gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> shall not prevail against it. And I will give to thee the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">keys of the kingdom of heaven</a>. And whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall be bound also in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, it shall be loosed also in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>". Then he commanded his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, that they should tell no one that he was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs13">Matthew 16:13-20</a>; <a href="../bible/mar008.htm#vrs27">Mark 8:27-30</a>; <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#vrs18">Luke 9:18-21</a>).

<p>By the word "rock" the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> cannot have meant Himself, but only Peter, as is so much more apparent in Aramaic in which the same word (Kipha) is used for "Peter" and "rock". His statement then admits of but one explanation, namely, that He wishes to make Peter the head of the whole community of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>; that through this foundation (Peter) the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of Christ</a> would be unconquerable; that the spiritual guidance of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> was placed in the hands of Peter, as the <a href="../cathen/15403b.htm">special representative</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. This meaning becomes so much the clearer when we <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">remember</a> that the words "bind" and "loose" are not metaphorical, but <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> juridical terms. It is also clear that the position of Peter among the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community was the basis for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a> on earth, that is, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of Christ</a>. Peter was personally installed as Head of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself. This foundation created for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by its <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Founder</a> could not disappear with the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Peter, but was intended to continue and did continue (as actual history shows) in the <a href="../cathen/12423a.htm">primacy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> and its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<p>Entirely inconsistent and in itself untenable is the position of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> who (like Schnitzer in recent times) assert that the <a href="../cathen/12423a.htm">primacy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman bishops</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a> from the precedence which Peter held among the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Just as the essential activity of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve Apostles</a> in building up and extending the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> did not entirely disappear with their deaths, so surely did the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> <a href="../cathen/12423a.htm">Primacy</a> of Peter not completely vanish. As intended by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it must have continued its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and development in a <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> appropriate to the <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">ecclesiastical organism</a>, just as the office of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> continued in an appropriate <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p>Objections have been raised against the <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">genuineness</a> of the wording of the passage, but the unanimous testimony of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, the parallel passages in the other <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, and the fixed <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of pre-Constantine literature furnish the surest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">genuineness</a> and untampered state of the text of <a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs18">Matthew</a> (cf. "Stimmen aus MariaLaach", I, 1896,129 sqq.; "Theologie und Glaube", II, 1910, 842 sqq.).
<h3>His difficulty with Christ's Passion</h3>

<p>In spite of his firm <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, Peter had so far no clear <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the mission and work of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">sufferings of Christ</a> especially, as contradictory to his worldly conception of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, were inconceivable to him, and his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> conception occasionally elicited a sharp reproof from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs21">Matthew 16:21-23</a>, <a href="../bible/mar008.htm#vrs31">Mark 8:31-33</a>). Peter's irresolute <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>, which continued notwithstanding his enthusiastic fidelity to his <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Master</a>, was clearly revealed in connection with the <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">Passion of Christ</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> had already told him that <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> had desired him that he might sift him as wheat. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for him that his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> fail not, and, being once <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, he confirms his brethren (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#vrs31">Luke 22:31-32</a>). Peter's assurance that he was ready to accompany his <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Master</a> to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and to death, elicited <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prediction</a> that Peter should deny Him (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs30">Matthew 26:30-35</a>; <a href="../bible/mar014.htm#vrs26">Mark 14:26-31</a>; <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#vrs31">Luke 22:31-34</a>; <a href="../bible/joh013.htm#vrs33">John 13:33-38</a>).

<p>When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> proceeded to <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">wash the feet</a> of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> before the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a>, and came first to Peter, the latter at first protested, but, on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> declaring that otherwise he should have no part with Him, immediately said: "Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head" (<a href="../bible/joh013.htm#vrs1">John 13:1-10</a>). In the <a href="../cathen/06540a.htm">Garden of Gethsemani</a> Peter had to submit to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour's</a> reproach that he had slept like the others, while his <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Master</a> suffered deadly <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">anguish</a> (<a href="../bible/mar014.htm#vrs37">Mark 14:37</a>). At the seizing of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, Peter in an outburst of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> wished to defend his <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Master</a> by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">force</a>, but was forbidden to do so. He at first took to flight with the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> (<a href="../bible/joh018.htm#vrs10">John 18:10-11</a>; <a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs56">Matthew 26:56</a>); then turning he followed his captured Lord to the courtyard of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">High Priest</a>, and there denied <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, asserting explicitly and swearing that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs58">Matthew 26:58-75</a>; <a href="../bible/mar014.htm#vrs54">Mark 14:54-72</a>; <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#vrs54">Luke 22:54-62</a>; <a href="../bible/joh018.htm#vrs15">John 18:15-27</a>). This denial was of course due, not to a lapse of interior <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but to exterior <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and cowardice. His sorrow was thus so much the greater, when, after his <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Master</a> had turned His gaze towards him, he clearly recognized what he had done.
<h3>The Risen Lord confirms Peter's precedence</h3>

<p>In spite of this weakness, his position as head of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> was later confirmed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and his precedence was not less conspicuous after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> than before. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who were the first to find <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">Christ's tomb</a> empty, received from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> a special message for Peter (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs7">Mark 16:7</a>). To him alone of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> appear on the first day after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#vrs34">Luke 24:34</a>; <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs5">1 Corinthians 15:5</a>). But, most important of all, when He appeared at the <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">Lake of Genesareth</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> renewed to Peter His special commission to feed and defend His flock, after Peter had thrice affirmed his special <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for his <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Master</a> (<a href="../bible/joh021.htm#vrs15">John 21:15-17</a>). In conclusion <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> foretold the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> death Peter would have to suffer, and thus invited him to follow Him in a special manner (<a href="../bible/joh021.htm#vrs20">John 21:20-23</a>). Thus was Peter <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">called</a> and trained for the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostleship</a> and clothed with the <a href="../cathen/12423a.htm">primacy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, which he exercised in a most unequivocal manner after <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Christ's Ascension</a> into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.

<h2 id="ii">St. Peter in Jerusalem and Palestine after the Ascension</h2>

<p>Our information concerning the earliest <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> activity of St. Peter in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judaea</a>, and the districts stretching northwards as far as <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> is derived mainly from the first portion of the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>, and is confirmed by parallel statements incidentally in the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>.

<p>Among the crowd of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who, after <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Christ's Ascension</a> into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> from <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">Mount Olivet</a>, returned to Jerusalem to await the fulfilment of His promise to send the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Peter is immediately conspicuous as the leader of all, and is henceforth constantly recognized as the head of the original <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian community</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. He takes the initiative in the appointment to the <a href="../cathen/04112a.htm">Apostolic College</a> of another <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life</a>, <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">death</a> and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to replace <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs15">Acts 1:15-26</a>). After the descent of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> on the <a href="../cathen/11661a.htm">feast of Pentecost</a>, Peter standing at the head of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> delivers the first public <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermon</a> to proclaim the <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life</a>, <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">death</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and wins a large number of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian community</a> (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#vrs14">Acts 2:14-41</a>). First of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, he worked a public <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, when with John he went up into the temple and cured the lame man at the Beautiful Gate. To the people crowding in amazement about the two <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, he preaches a long <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermon</a> in the Porch of Solomon, and brings new increase to the flock of believers (<a href="../bible/act003.htm#vrs1">Acts 3:1-4:4</a>).

<p>In the subsequent examinations of the two <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> before the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Jewish High Council</a>, Peter defends in undismayed and impressive fashion the cause of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> and liberty of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> to preach the Gospel (<a href="../bible/act004.htm#vrs5">Acts 4:5-21</a>). When Ananias and Sapphira attempt to deceive the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and the people Peter appears as judge of their action, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> executes the <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentence</a> of punishment passed by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> by causing the sudden death of the two guilty parties (<a href="../bible/act005.htm#vrs1">Acts 5:1-11</a>). By numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> confirms the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> activity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/04215a.htm">confessors</a>, and here also there is special mention of Peter, since it is recorded that the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and neighbouring towns carried their sick in their beds into the streets so that the shadow of Peter might fall on them and they might be thereby healed (<a href="../bible/act005.htm#vrs12">Acts 5:12-16</a>). The ever-increasing number of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Jewish supreme council</a> to adopt new measures against the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, but "Peter and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>" answer that they "ought to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rather than men" (<a href="../bible/act005.htm#vrs29">Acts 5:29 sqq.</a>). Not only in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> itself did Peter labour in fulfilling the mission entrusted to him by his <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Master</a>. He also retained connection with the other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities in Palestine, and preached the Gospel both there and in the lands situated farther north. When Philip the Deacon had won a large number of believers in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, Peter and John were deputed to proceed thither from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to organize the community and to invoke the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to descend upon the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Peter appears a second time as judge, in the case of the <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">magician Simon</a>, who had wished to purchase from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> the power that he also could invoke the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> (<a href="../bible/act008.htm#vrs14">Acts 8:14-25</a>). On their way back to Jerusalem, the two <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> preached the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyous</a> tidings of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>. Subsequently, after <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> departure from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> before <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities in Palestine were left at peace by the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Jewish council</a>.

<p>Peter now undertook an extensive missionary tour, which brought him to the maritime cities, <a href="../cathen/09468b.htm">Lydda</a>, <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a>, and Caesarea. In <a href="../cathen/09468b.htm">Lydda</a> he cured the palsied Eneas, in <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a> he raised Tabitha (Dorcas) from the dead; and at <a href="../cathen/03133b.htm">Caesarea</a>, instructed by a vision which he had in <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a>, he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the first <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">non-Jewish</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a> <a href="../cathen/04375b.htm">Cornelius</a> and his kinsmen (<a href="../bible/act009.htm#vrs31">Acts 9:31-10:48</a>). On Peter's return to Jerusalem a little later, the strict <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Jewish Christians</a>, who regarded the complete observance of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Jewish law</a> as binding on all, asked him why he had entered and eaten in the house of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">uncircumcised</a>. Peter tells of his vision and defends his action, which was ratified by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../bible/act011.htm#vrs1">Acts 11:1-18</a>).

<p>A confirmation of the position accorded to Peter by <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">Luke</a>, in the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts</a>, is afforded by the testimony of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/gal001.htm#vrs18">Galatians 1:18-20</a>). After his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> and three years' residence in <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> came to Jerusalem "to see Peter". Here the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle of the Gentiles</a> clearly designates Peter as the authorized head of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and of the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>. Peter's long residence in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and Palestine soon came to an end. <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#IV">Herod Agrippa I</a> began (A.D. 42-44) a new <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; after the execution of James, the son of Zebedee, this ruler had Peter cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, intending to have him also executed after the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a> was over. Peter, however, was freed in a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> manner, and, proceeding to the house of the <a href="../cathen/09749a.htm">mother of John Mark</a>, where many of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> were assembled for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, informed them of his liberation from the hands of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, commissioned them to communicate the fact to James and the brethren, and then left <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to go to "another place" (<a href="../bible/act012.htm#vrs1">Acts 12:1-18</a>). Concerning St. Peter's subsequent activity we receive no further connected information from the extant sources, although we possess short notices of certain individual episodes of his later life.

<h2 id="iii">Missionary journeys in the East; Council of the Apostles</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">St. Luke</a> does not tell us whither Peter went after his liberation from the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. From incidental statements we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he subsequently made extensive missionary tours in the East, although we are given no clue to the <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> of his journeys. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that he remained for a time at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>; he may even have returned thither several times. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> was founded by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianized</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who had been driven from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> (<a href="../bible/act011.htm#vrs19">Acts 11:19 sqq.</a>). Peter's residence among them is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the episode concerning the observance of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Jewish ceremonial law</a> even by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianized</a> <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, related by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs11">Galatians 2:11-21</a>). The chief <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> &mdash; the "pillars", Peter, James, and John &mdash; had unreservedly approved <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> Apostolate to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, while they themselves intended to labour principally among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. While <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was dwelling in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> (the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> cannot be accurately determined), St. Peter came thither and mingled freely with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">non-Jewish</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the community, frequenting their houses and sharing their meals. But when the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianized</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> arrived in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, Peter, fearing lest these rigid observers of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Jewish ceremonial law</a> should be <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a> thereat, and his influence with the <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Jewish Christians</a> be imperiled, avoided thenceforth eating with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">uncircumcised</a>.

<p>His conduct made a great impression on the other <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, so that even Barnabas, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> companion, now avoided eating with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianized</a> <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>. As this action was entirely opposed to the principles and practice of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and might lead to confusion among the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, this <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> addressed a public reproach to St. Peter, because his conduct seemed to indicate a wish to compel the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a> to become <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and accept <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Jewish law</a>. The whole incident is another <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the authoritative position of St. Peter in the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, since his example and conduct was regarded as decisive. But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who rightly saw the inconsistency in the conduct of Peter and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, did not hesitate to defend the immunity of <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> from the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Jewish Law</a>. Concerning Peter's subsequent attitude on this question <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> gives us no explicit information. But it is highly probable that Peter ratified the contention of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle of the Gentiles</a>, and thenceforth conducted himself towards the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianized</a> <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> as at first. As the principal opponents of his views in this connexion, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> names and combats in all his writings only the <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">extreme Jewish Christians</a> coming "from James" (i.e., from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>). While the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of this occurrence, whether before or after the Council of the Apostles, cannot be determined, it probably took place after the council (see below). The later <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a>, which existed as early as the end of the second century (<a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, "Hom. vi in Lucam"; Eusebius, <a href="../fathers/250103.htm#chapter36"><em>Church History</em> III.36</a>), that Peter founded the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">Church of Antioch</a>, indicates the fact that he laboured a long period there, and also perhaps that he dwelt there towards the end of his life and then appointed <a href="../cathen/05653a.htm">Evodrius</a>, the first of the line of <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">Antiochian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, head of the community. This latter view would best explain the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> referring the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">Church of Antioch</a> to St. Peter.

<p>It is also probable that Peter pursued his <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> labours in various districts of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> for it can scarcely be supposed that the entire period between his liberation from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and the Council of the Apostles was spent uninterruptedly in one city, whether Antioch, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, or elsewhere. And, since he subsequently addressed the <a href="../bible/1pe000.htm">first of his Epistles</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> in the Provinces of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, Galatia, Cappadocia, and <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, one may reasonably assume that he had laboured personally at least in certain cities of these provinces, devoting himself chiefly to the <a href="../cathen/04775c.htm">Diaspora</a>. The Epistle, however, is of a general character, and gives little indication of personal relations with the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to whom it is addressed. The <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> related by Bishop Dionysius of Corinth (in Eusebius, <a href="../fathers/250102.htm#chapter28"><em>Church History</em> II.25</a>) in his letter to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> under <a href="../cathen/03144c.htm">Pope Soter</a> (165-74), that Peter had (like <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>) dwelt in <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> and planted the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there, cannot be entirely rejected. Even though the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> should receive no support from the existence of the "party of Cephas", which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> mentions among the other divisions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#vrs12">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="../bible/1co003.htm#vrs22">3:22</a>), still Peter's sojourn in <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> (even in connection with the planting and government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>) is not impossible. That St. Peter undertook various <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> journeys (doubtless about this time, especially when he was no longer permanently residing in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>) is clearly established by the general remark of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> in <a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs5">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>, concerning the "rest of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brethren [cousins] of the Lord</a>, and Cephas", who were travelling around in the exercise of their <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostleship</a>.

<p>Peter returned occasionally to the original <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, the guidance of which was entrusted to <a href="../cathen/08275b.htm">St. James</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">relative of Jesus</a>, after the departure of the Prince of the Apostles (A.D. 42-44). The last mention of St. Peter in the Acts (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs1">15:1-29</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs1">Galatians 2:1-10</a>) occurs in the report of the Council of the Apostles on the occasion of such a passing visit. In consequence of the trouble <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">extreme Jewish Christians</a> to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Barnabas at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">Church of this city</a> sent these two <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> with other envoys to Jerusalem to secure a definitive decision concerning the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> (see <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">JUDAIZERS</a>). In addition to James, Peter and John were then (about A.D. 50-51) in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. In the discussion and decision of this important question, Peter naturally exercised a decisive influence. When a great divergence of views had manifested itself in the assembly, Peter spoke the deciding word. Long before, in accordance with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> testimony, he had announced the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> (<a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of <a href="../cathen/04375b.htm">Cornelius</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">household</a>); why, therefore, attempt to place the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> yoke on the necks of <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>? After <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Barnabas had related how <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had wrought among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> by them, James, the chief representative of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, adopted Peter's view and in agreement therewith made proposals which were expressed in an <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">encyclical</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>.

<p>The occurrences in <a href="../cathen/03133b.htm">Caesarea</a> and Antioch and the debate at the Council of Jerusalem show clearly Peter's attitude towards the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a> from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>. Like the other eleven original <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, he regarded himself as called to preach the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> first among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#vrs42">Acts 10:42</a>), so that the chosen people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> might share in the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, promised to them primarily and issuing from their midst. The vision at <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a> and the effusion of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> over the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/04375b.htm">Cornelius</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kinsmen</a> determined Peter to admit these forthwith into the community of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, without imposing on them the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Jewish Law</a>. During his <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> journeys outside Palestine, he recognized in practice the equality of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a>, as his original conduct at Antioch <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proves</a>. His aloofness from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a>, out of consideration for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, was by no means an official recognition of the views of the extreme <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaizers</a>, who were so opposed to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. This is established clearly and incontestably by his attitude at the Council of Jerusalem. Between Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> there was no <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> difference in their conception of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. The recognition of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> as the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs1">Galatians 2:1-9</a>) was entirely sincere, and excludes all question of a fundamental divergence of views. St. Peter and the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> recognized the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a> from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> brothers on an equal footing; <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> formed a single <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of Christ</a>. If therefore Peter devoted the preponderating portion of his <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> activity to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, this arose chiefly from practical considerations, and from the position of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> as the Chosen People. Baur's hypothesis of opposing currents of "Petrinism" and "Paulinism" in the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is absolutely untenable, and is today entirely rejected by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>.

<h2 id="iv">Activity and death in Rome; burial place</h2>

<p>It is an indisputably established historical fact that St. Peter laboured in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> during the last portion of his life, and there ended his earthly course by <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. As to the duration of his <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> activity in the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman capital</a>, the continuity or otherwise of his residence there, the details and success of his labours, and the <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> of his arrival and death, all these questions are uncertain, and can be solved only on hypotheses more or less well-founded. The essential fact is that Peter died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>: this constitutes the historical foundation of the claim of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishops of Rome</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> <a href="../cathen/12423a.htm">Primacy</a> of Peter.

<p>St. Peter's residence and death in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> are established beyond contention as historical facts by a series of distinct testimonies extending from the end of the first to the end of the second centuries, and issuing from several lands. <ul><li>That the manner, and therefore the place of his death, must have been <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in widely extended <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> circles at the end of the first century is clear from the remark introduced into the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Gospel of St. John</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> that Peter was bound to Him and would be led whither he would not &mdash; "And this he said, signifying by what death he should glorify <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh021.htm#vrs18">John 21:18-19</a>, see above). Such a remark presupposes in the readers of the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a> a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the death of Peter. <li><a href="../bible/1pe000.htm">St. Peter's First Epistle</a> was written almost undoubtedly from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, since the salutation at the end reads: "The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> that is in Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you: and so doth my son <a href="../cathen/09672c.htm">Mark</a>" (<a href="../bible/mar005.htm#vrs13">5:13</a>). Babylon must here be identified with the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman capital</a>; since <a href="../cathen/02179a.htm">Babylon on the Euphrates</a>, which lay in ruins, or New Babylon (Seleucia) on the Tigris, or the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Babylon near <a href="../cathen/10176a.htm">Memphis</a>, or <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> cannot be meant, the reference must be to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the only city which is called Babylon elsewhere in ancient <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature (<a href="../bible/rev017.htm#vrs5">Revelation 17:5</a>; <a href="../bible/rev018.htm#vrs10">18:10</a>; "Oracula Sibyl.", V, verses 143 and 159, ed. Geffcken, <a href="../cathen/09138b.htm">Leipzig</a>, 1902, 111). <li>From <a href="../cathen/11457c.htm">Bishop Papias of Hierapolis</a> and <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, who both appeal to the testimony of the old <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> (i.e., the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>), we learn that <a href="../cathen/09672c.htm">Mark</a> wrote his <a href="../bible/mar000.htm">Gospel</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at the request of the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who desired a written memorial of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> preached to them by St. Peter and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250102.htm#chapter15"><em>Church History</em> II.15</a>, <a href="../fathers/250103.htm#chapter40">3.40</a>, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm#chapter14">6.14</a>); this is confirmed by <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103301.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> 3.1</a>). In connection with this information concerning the <a href="../bible/mar000.htm">Gospel of St. Mark</a>, <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, relying perhaps on an earlier source, says that Peter described <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> figuratively as Babylon in his <a href="../bible/1pe000.htm">First Epistle</a>. <li>Another testimony concerning the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is supplied by <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">Clement of Rome</a> in his <a href="../fathers/1010.htm">Epistle to the Corinthians</a> (written about A.D. 95-97), wherein he says (<a href="../fathers/1010.htm#chapter5">chapter 5</a>): "Through <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and cunning the greatest and most righteous supports [of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>] have suffered <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and been warred to death. Let us place before our eyes the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> &mdash; St. Peter, who in consequence of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, suffered not one or two, but numerous miseries, and, having thus given testimony (<em>martyresas</em>), has entered the merited <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">place of glory</a>". He then mentions <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and a number of <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, who were assembled with the others and suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> "among us" (<em>en hemin</em>, i.e., among the Romans, the meaning that the expression also bears in <a href="../fathers/1010.htm#chapter4">chapter 4</a>). He is speaking undoubtedly, as the whole passage <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proves</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Neronian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and thus refers the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to that epoch. <li>In his letter written at the beginning of the second century (before 117), while being brought to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, the venerable <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Bishop Ignatius of Antioch</a> endeavours by every means to restrain the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> from striving for his pardon, remarking: "I issue you no commands, like Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>: they were <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, while I am but a captive" (<a href="../fathers/0107.htm#chapter4"><em>Epistle to the Romans</em> 4</a>). The meaning of this remark must be that the two <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> laboured personally in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and with <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> authority preached the Gospel there. <li>Bishop Dionysius of Corinth, in his letter to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="../cathen/03144c.htm">Pope Soter</a> (165-74), says: "You have therefore by your urgent exhortation bound close together the sowing of Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>.

In <a href="../fathers/0311.htm#chapter36"><em>De Pr&aelig;scriptione</em> 36</a>, he says: "If thou art near <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, thou hast <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where authority is ever within reach. How fortunate is this <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for which the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> have poured out their whole teaching with their blood, where Peter has emulated the Passion of the Lord, where <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with the death of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a>". In <a href="../fathers/0318.htm"><em>Scorpiace</em> 15</a>, he also speaks of Peter's crucifixion. "The budding <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> first made bloody in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. There Peter was girded by another, since he was bound to the cross". As an illustration that it was immaterial with what water <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is administered, he states in his book (<a href="../fathers/0321.htm#chapter5"><em>On Baptism</em> 5</a>) that there is "no difference between that with which <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> and that with which Peter <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the Tiber"; and against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> he appeals to the testimony of the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, "to whom Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> have bequeathed the Gospel sealed with their blood" (<a href="../fathers/03124.htm#chapter5"><em>Against Marcion</em> 4.5</a>). <li>The Roman, <a href="../cathen/03144a.htm">Caius</a>, who lived in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="../cathen/15756c.htm">Pope Zephyrinus</a> (198-217), wrote in his "Dialogue with Proclus" (in Eusebius, <a href="../fathers/250102.htm#chapter25"><em>Church History</em> II.25</a>) directed against the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a>: "But I can show the trophies of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. If you care to go to the <a href="../cathen/15276b.htm">Vatican</a> or to the road to <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, thou shalt find the trophies of those who have founded this <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>". By the trophies (<em>tropaia</em>) <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> understands the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">graves</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, but his view is opposed by modern investigators who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the place of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">execution</a> is meant. For our purpose it is immaterial which opinion is correct, as the testimony retains its full value in either case. At any rate the place of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">execution</a> and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">burial</a> of both were close together; St. Peter, who was executed on the <a href="../cathen/15276b.htm">Vatican</a>, received also his <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">burial</a> there. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> also refers to "the <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">inscription</a> of the names of Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, which have been preserved to the present day on the burial-places there" (i.e. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>). <li>There thus existed in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> an ancient epigraphic memorial commemorating the death of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. The obscure notice in the <a href="../cathen/10642a.htm">Muratorian Fragment</a> ("Lucas optime theofile conprindit quia sub praesentia eius singula gerebantur sicuti et semote passionem petri evidenter declarat", ed. Preuschen, T&uuml;bingen, 1910, p. 29) also presupposes an ancient definite <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> concerning Peter's death in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <li>The <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> Acts of St. Peter and the <a href="../fathers/0815.htm">Acts of Sts. Peter and Paul</a> likewise belong to the series of testimonies of the death of the two <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. </ul>

<p>In opposition to this distinct and unanimous testimony of early <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, some few <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> historians have attempted in recent times to set aside the residence and death of Peter at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as legendary. These attempts have resulted in complete failure. It was asserted that the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> concerning Peter's residence in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> first originated in <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionite</a> circles, and formed part of the Legend of <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon the Magician</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is opposed by Peter as a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> under <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon</a>; just as this fight was transplanted to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, so also sprang up at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the legend of Peter's activity in that capital (thus in Baur, "Paulus", 2nd ed., 245 sqq., followed by Hase and especially <a href="../cathen/09280b.htm">Lipsius</a>, "Die quellen der r&ouml;mischen Petrussage", Kiel, 1872). But this hypothesis is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> fundamentally untenable by the whole character and purely local importance of <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionitism</a>, and is directly refuted by the above genuine and entirely independent testimonies, which are at least as ancient. It has moreover been now entirely abandoned by serious <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> historians (cf., e.g., Harnack's remarks in "Gesch. der altchristl. Literatur", II, i, 244, n. 2). A more recent attempt was made by Erbes (Zeitschr. fur Kirchengesch., 1901, pp. 1 sqq., 161 sqq.) to demonstrate that St. Peter was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. He appeals to the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> Acts of St. Peter, in which two Romans, Albinus and Agrippa, are mentioned as persecutors of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. These he identifies with the Albinus, <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">Procurator</a> of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judaea</a>, and successor of Festus and <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#V">Agrippa II</a>, Prince of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, and thence conciudes that Peter was condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> by this <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The untenableness of this hypothesis becomes immediately apparent from the mere fact that our earliest definite testimony concerning Peter's death in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> far antedates the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> Acts; besides, never throughout the whole range of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity has any city other than <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> been designated the place of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of Sts. Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.

<p>Although the fact of St. Peter's activity and death in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is so clearly established, we possess no precise information regarding the details of his <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> sojourn. The narratives contained in the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal literature</a> of the second century concerning the supposed strife between Peter and <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> belong to the domain of <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">legend</a>. From the already mentioned statements regarding the origin of the <a href="../bible/mar000.htm">Gospel of St. Mark</a> we may conclude that Peter laboured for a long period in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This conclusion is confirmed by the unanimous voice of <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> which, as early as the second half of the second century, designates the Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> the founder of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. It is widely held that Peter paid a first visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> after he had been <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> liberated from the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; that, by "another place", <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">Luke</a> meant <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but omitted the name for special reasons. It is not impossible that Peter made a missionary journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> about this time (after 42 A.D.), but such a journey cannot be established with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>. At any rate, we cannot appeal in support of this theory to the chronological notices in <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, since, although these notices extend back to the chronicles of the third century, they are not old <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">traditions</a>, but the result of calculations on the basis of episcopal lists. Into the <a href="../cathen/12272a.htm">Roman list of bishops</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the second century, there was introduced in the third century (as we learn from <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> and the "Chronograph of 354") the notice of a twenty-five years' pontificate for St. Peter, but we are unable to trace its origin. This entry consequently affords no ground for the hypothesis of a first visit by St. Peter to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> after his liberation from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> (about 42). We can therefore admit only the possibility of such an early visit to the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">capital</a>.

<p>The task of determining the year of St. Peter's death is attended with similar difficulties. In the fourth century, and even in the chronicles of the third, we find two different entries. In the "Chronicle" of <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> the thirteenth or fourteenth year of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> is given as that of the death of Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> (67-68); this <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, accepted by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, is that generally held. The year 67 is also supported by the statement, also accepted by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, that Peter came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under the Emperor Claudius (according to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, in 42), and by the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> of the twenty-five years' episcopate of Peter (cf. Bartolini, "Sopra l'anno 67 se fosse quello del martirio dei gloriosi Apostoli", Rome, 1868) . A different statement is furnished by the "Chronograph of 354" (ed. Duchesne, <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, I, 1 sqq.). This refers St. Peter's arrival in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to the year 30, and his death and that of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> to 55.

<p>Duchesne has shown that the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dates</a> in the "Chronograph" were inserted in a <a href="../cathen/12272a.htm">list of the popes</a> which contains only their names and the duration of their pontificates, and then, on the chronological supposition that the year of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's death</a> was 29, the year 30 was inserted as the beginning of Peter's pontificate, and his death referred to 55, on the basis of the twenty-five years' pontificate (op. cit., introd., vi sqq.). This <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> has however been recently defended by Kellner ("Jesus von Nazareth u. seine Apostel im Rahmen der Zeitgeschichte", Ratisbon, 1908; "Tradition geschichtl. Bearbeitung u. Legende in der Chronologie des apostol. Zeitalters", Bonn, 1909). Other historians have accepted the year 65 (e.g., <a href="../cathen/02541a.htm">Bianchini</a>, in his edition of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> in P.L. CXXVII. 435 sqq.) or 66 (e.g. Foggini, "De romani b. Petri itinere et episcopatu", Florence, 1741; also <a href="../cathen/14724b.htm">Tillemont</a>). Harnack endeavoured to establish the year 64 (i.e. the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Neronian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>) as that of Peter's death ("Gesch. der altchristl. Lit. bis Eusebius", pt. II, "Die Chronologie", I, 240 sqq.). This <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, which had been already supported by Cave, du Pin, and Wieseler, has been accepted by Duchesne (Hist. ancienne de l'&eacute;glise, I, 64). Erbes refers St. Peter's death to 22 Feb., 63, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> to 64 ("Texte u. Untersuchungen", new series, IV, i, <a href="../cathen/09138b.htm">Leipzig</a>, 1900, "Die Todestage der Apostel Petrus u. Paulus u. ihre rom. Denkmaeler"). The <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of Peter's death is thus not yet decided; the period between July, 64 (outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Neronian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>), and the beginning of 68 (on 9 July <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> fled from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and committed <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a>) must be left open for the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death. The day of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is also unknown; 29 June, the accepted day of his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> since the fourth century, cannot be proved to be the day of his death (see below).

<p>Concerning the manner of Peter's death, we possess a <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> &mdash; attested to by <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> at the end of the second century (see above) and by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (in Eusebius, <a href="../fathers/250102.htm#chapter1"><em>Church History</em> II.1</a>)&mdash;that he suffered crucifixion. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says: "Peter was crucified at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with his head downwards, as he himself had desired to suffer". As the place of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">execution</a> may be accepted with great probability the Neronian Gardens on the <a href="../cathen/15276b.htm">Vatican</a>, since there, according to Tacitus, were enacted in general the gruesome scenes of the <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Neronian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>; and in this district, in the vicinity of the Via Cornelia and at the foot of the Vatican Hills, the Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> found his <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">burial place</a>. Of this grave (since the word <em>tropaion</em> was, as already remarked, rightly understood of the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>) <a href="../cathen/03144a.htm">Caius</a> already speaks in the third century. For a <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">remains</a> of Peter lay with those of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in a vault on the Appian Way at the place <em>ad Catacumbas</em>, where the Church of St. Sebastian (which on its erection in the fourth century was <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to the two <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>) now stands. The <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">remains</a> had probably been brought thither at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/15256b.htm">Valerian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> in 258, to protect them from the threatened <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecration</a> when the Christian burial-places were confiscated. They were later restored to their former resting-place, and <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a> had a magnificent <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> erected over the grave of St. Peter at the foot of the <a href="../cathen/15276b.htm">Vatican Hill</a>. This <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> was replaced by the present St. Peter's in the sixteenth century. The vault with the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a> built above it (<a href="../cathen/04214a.htm">confessio</a>) has been since the fourth century the most highly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> shrine in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a>. In the substructure of the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>, over the vault which contained the sarcophagus with the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">remains</a> of St. Peter, a <a href="../cathen/04214a.htm">cavity</a> was made. This was closed by a small door in front of the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>. By opening this door the pilgrim could enjoy the great <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a> of <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">kneeling</a> directly over the sarcophagus of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a>. Keys of this door were given as previous souvenirs (cf. <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a>, "De gloria martyrum", I, xxviii).

<p>The memory of St. Peter is also closely associated with the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of St. Priscilla on the Via Salaria. According to a <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a>, current in later <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity, St. Peter here instructed the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> and administered <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. This <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> seems to have been based on still earlier monumental testimonies. The <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> is situated under the garden of a villa of the ancient <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and senatorial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, the Acilii Glabriones, and its foundation extends back to the end of the first century; and since <a href="../cathen/06575a.htm">Acilius Glabrio</a>, consul in 91, was condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> under <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, it is quite possible that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> extended back to <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> times, and that the Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> had been given hospitable reception in their house during his residence at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The relations between Peter and Pudens whose house stood on the site of the present titular church of Pudens (now Santa Pudentiana) seem to rest rather on a legend.

<p>Concerning the Epistles of St. Peter, see <a href="../cathen/11752a.htm">EPISTLES OF SAINT PETER</a>; concerning the various <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocrypha</a> bearing the name of Peter, especially the Apocalypse and the Gospel of St. Peter, see <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">APOCRYPHA</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> sermon of Peter (<em>kerygma</em>), <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the second half of the second century, was probably a collection of supposed <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a>; several fragments are preserved by <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (cf. Dobschuts, "Das Kerygma Petri kritisch untersucht" in "Texte u. Untersuchungen", XI, i, Leipzig, 1893).

<h2 id="v">Feasts of St. Peter</h2>

<p>As early as the fourth century a <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> was celebrated in <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> of Sts. Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> on the same day, although the day was not the same in the East as in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">Martyrology</a> of the end of the fourth century, which is an excerpt from a Greek catalogue of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> from <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, gives the following <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feasts</a> in connexion with <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> (25 Dec.): 26 Dec., <a href="../cathen/14287a.htm">St. Stephen</a>; 27 Dec., Sts. James and John; 28 Dec., Sts. Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. In <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa's</a> panegyric on <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> we are also informed that these <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feasts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/14287a.htm">St. Stephen</a> follow immediately after <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> celebrated the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> also on 27 Dec.; the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> on the second Friday after the <a href="../cathen/05504c.htm">Epiphany</a>. It is evident that 28 (27) Dec. was (like 26 Dec. for <a href="../cathen/14287a.htm">St. Stephen</a>) arbitrarily selected, no <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints'</a> death being forthcoming. The chief <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of Sts. Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was kept in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 29 June as early as the third or fourth century. The list of <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feasts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in the Chronograph of Philocalus appends this notice to the date &mdash; "III. Kal. Jul. Petri in Catacumbas et Pauli Ostiense Tusco et Basso Cose." (=the year 258) . The "Martyrologium Hieronyminanum" has, in the <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, the following notice for 29 June: "Romae via Aurelia natale sanctorum Apostolorum Petri et Pauli, Petri in Vaticano, Pauli in via Ostiensi, utrumque in catacumbas, passi sub Nerone, Basso et Tusco consulibus" (ed. de Rossi-Duchesne, 84).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> 258 in the notices shows that from this year the memory of the two <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> was celebrated on 29 June in the Via Appia <em>ad Catacumbas</em> (near San Sebastiano fuori le mura), because on this <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the remains of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> were translated thither (<em>see above</em>). Later, perhaps on the building of the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> over the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">graves</a> on the <a href="../cathen/15276b.htm">Vatican</a> and in the Via Ostiensis, the remains were restored to their former resting-place: Peter's to the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Vatican Basilica</a> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">church on the Via Ostiensis</a>. In the place <em>Ad Catacumbas</em> a <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> was also built as early as the fourth century in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the two <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. From 258 their principal <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> was kept on 29 June, on which <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> Divine Service was held in the above-mentioned three <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> from ancient times (Duchesne, "Origines du culte chretien", 5th ed., Paris, 1909, 271 sqq., 283 sqq.; Urbain, "Ein Martyrologium der christl. Gemeinde zu Rom an Anfang des 5. Jahrh.", Leipzig, 1901, 169 sqq.; Kellner, "Heortologie", 3rd ed., Freiburg, 1911, 210 sqq.). Legend sought to explain the temporary occupation by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> of the grave <em>Ad Catacumbas</em> by supposing that, shortly after their death, the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Christians</a> wished to steal their bodies and bring them to the East. This whole story is evidently a product of popular legend. (Concerning the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">Feast</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03551e.htm">Chair of Peter</a>, see <a href="../cathen/03551e.htm">C<font size=-2>HAIR OF</font> P<font size=-2>ETER</font></a>.)

<p>A third <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> takes place on 1 August: the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of St. Peter's Chains. This <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> was originally the <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedication</a> <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a>, erected on the Esquiline Hill in the fourth century. A titular <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a>, Philippus, was <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> at the <a href="../cathen/05491a.htm">Council of Ephesus</a> in 431. The <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> was rebuilt by <a href="../cathen/14032a.htm">Sixtus III</a> (432-40) at the expense of the Byzantine imperial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Either the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> took place on 1 August, or this was the day of <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedication</a> of the earlier <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a>. Perhaps this day was selected to replace the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> festivities which took place on 1 August. In this <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a>, which is still standing (S. Pietro in Vincoli), were probably preserved from the fourth century St. Peter's chains, which were greatly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>, small filings from the chains being regarded as precious <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> thus early received the name <em>in Vinculis</em>, and the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of 1 August became the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of St. Peter's Chains (Duchesne, op. cit., 286 sqq.; Kellner, loc. cit., 216 sqq.). The memory of both Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was later associated also with two places of ancient <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>: the Via Sacra, outside the Forum, where the <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">magician Simon</a> was said to have been hurled down at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of Peter and the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> <em>Tullianum</em>, or <em>Carcer Mamertinus</em>, where the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> were supposed to have been kept until their <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">execution</a>. At both these places, also, shrines of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> were erected, and that of the <a href="../cathen/09579a.htm">Mamertine Prison</a> still remains in almost its original form from the early Roman <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. These local commemorations of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> are based on legends, and no special celebrations are held in the two <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>. It is, however, not impossible that Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> were actually confined in the chief <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at the fort of the Capitol, of which the present <em>Carcer Mamertinus</em> is a remnant.

<h2 id="vi">Representations of St. Peter</h2>

<p>The oldest extant is the bronze medallion with the heads of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>; this <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dates</a> from the end of the second or the beginning of the third century, and is preserved in the <a href="../cathen/10647a.htm">Christian Museum</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15276b.htm">Vatican</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">Library</a>. Peter has a strong, roundish head, prominent jaw-bones, a receding forehead, thick, curly hair and <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a>. (<em>See illustration in</em> <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">C<font size=-2>ATACOMBS</font></a>.) The features are so <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> that it partakes of the nature of a portrait. This type is also found in two representations of St. Peter in a chamber of the Catacomb of Peter and Marcellinus, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the second half of the third century (Wilpert, "Die Malerein der Katakomben Rom", plates 94 and 96). In the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> Sts. Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> frequently appear as <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">interceders and advocates for the dead</a> in the representations of the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">Last Judgment</a> (Wilpert, 390 sqq.), and as introducing an <a href="../cathen/11269a.htm">Orante</a> (a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> figure representing the dead) into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Paradise</a>.

<p>In the numerous representations of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the midst of His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, which occur in the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> and carved on sarcophagi, Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> always occupy the places of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> on the right and left of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the fourth to the ninth centuries, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> appears as the central figure, with Sts. Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> on His right and left, and besides these the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> especially <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the particular church. On sarcophagi and other memorials appear scenes from the life of St. Peter: his walking on <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">Lake Genesareth</a>, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> summoned him from the boat; the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of his denial; the <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">washing of his feet</a>; the raising of Tabitha from the dead; the capture of Peter and the conducting of him to the place of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">execution</a>. On two gilt glasses he is represented as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> drawing water from the rock with his staff; the name Peter under the scene shows that he is regarded as the guide of the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>.

<p>Particularly frequent in the period between the fourth and sixth centuries is the scene of the delivery of the Law to Peter, which occurs on various kinds of monuments. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> hands St. Peter a folded or open scroll, on which is often the inscription <em>Lex Domini</em> (Law of the Lord) or <em>Dominus legem dat</em> (The Lord gives the law). In the mausoleum of Constantina at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (S. Costanza, in the Via Nomentana) this scene is given as a pendant to the delivery of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. In representations on fifth-century sarcophagi the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> presents to Peter (instead of the scroll) the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">keys</a>. In carvings of the fourth century Peter often bears a staff in his hand (after the fifth century, a cross with a long shaft, carried by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> on his shoulder), as a kind of sceptre indicative of Peter's office. From the end of the sixth century this is replaced by the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">keys</a> (usually two, but sometimes three), which henceforth became the attribute of Peter. Even the renowned and greatly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> bronze <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> in St. Peter's possesses them; this, the best-known representation of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a>, dates from the last period of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity (Grisar, "Analecta romana", I, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1899, 627 sqq.).
