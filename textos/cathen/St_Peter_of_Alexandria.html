<h1>St. Peter of Alexandria</h1>  

<p>Became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> in 300; <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> Nov., 311. According to Philip of Sidetes he was at one time head of the famous <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. His <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> importance lies in the fact that he marked, very probably initiated, the reaction at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> against extreme <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenism</a>.

<p>When during the <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> Peter left Alexandria for concealment, the Meletian <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> broke out. There are three different accounts of this <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>: (1) According to three Latin documents (translation from lost Greek originals) published by <a href="../cathen/16058b.htm">Maffei</a>, Meletius (or Melitius), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09468a.htm">Lycopolis</a>, took advantage of St. Peter's absence to usurp his patriarchal functions, and contravened the canons by consecrating <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to sees not vacant, their occupants being in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> for the Faith. Four of them remonstrated, but Meletius took no heed of them and actually went to <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, where, at the instigation of one Isidore, and Arius the future heresiarch, he set aside those left in charge by Peter and appointed others. Upon this Peter <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him. (2) <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> accuses Meletius not only of turbulent and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> conduct, but of sacrificing, and denouncing Peter to the emperor. There is no incompatibility between the Latin documents and St. Athanasius, but the statement that Meletius sacrificed must be received with caution; it was probably based upon rumour arising out of the immunity which he appeared to enjoy. At all events nothing was heard about the charge at the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a>. (3) According to <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> (Haer., 68), Meletius and St. Peter quarrelled over the reconciliation of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm"><em>lapsi</em></a>, the former inclining to sterner views. Epiphanius probably derived his information from a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Meletian source, and his story is full of historical blunders. Thus, to take one example, Peter is made a fellow-prisoner of Meletius and is <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. According to <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> was unexpected, and therefore not preceded by a term of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>.

<p>There are extant a collection of fourteen canons issued by Peter in the third year of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> dealing chiefly with the <em><a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsi</a>,</em> excerpted probably from an <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Festal Epistle. The fact that they were ratified by the Council of Trullo, and thus became part of the canon law of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, probably accounts for their preservation. Many <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> contain a fifteenth canon taken from writing on the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>. The cases of different kinds of <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsi</a> were decided upon in these canons.

<p>The Acts of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of St. Peter are too late to have any historical value. In them is the story of Christ appearing to St. Peter with His garment rent, foretelling the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. Three passages from "On the Godhead", apparently written against <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> subordinationist views, were quoted by St. Cyril at the Council of Ephesus. Two further passages (in Syriac) claiming to be from the same book, were printed by Pitra in "Analecta Sacra", IV, 188; their genuineness is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. <a href="../cathen/09179b.htm">Leontius of Byzantium</a> quotes a passage affirming the two Natures of Christ from a work on "The Coming of Christ", and two passages from the first book of a treatise against the view that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had existed and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> before it was united to the body. This treatise must have been written against <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>. Very important are seven fragments preserved in Syriac (Pitra, op. cit., IV, 189-93) from another work on the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">Resurrection</a>, in which the identity of the risen with the earthly body is maintained against <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>.

<p>Five <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> fragments were also published by Pitra (op. cit., IV, 430 sq.). Two of these correspond with one of the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> Syriac fragments. The remaining three are probably <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> forgeries (Harnack, "Altchrist. Lit.", 447). A fragment quoted by the Emperor Justinian in his Letter to the Patriarch <a href="../cathen/10190a.htm">Mennas</a>, purporting to be taken from a Mystagogia of St. Peter's, is probably spurious (see Routh, "Reliq. Sac.", III, 372; Harnack, op. cit., 448). The "Chronicon Paschale" gives a long extract from a supposed writing of Peter on the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>. This is condemned as spurious by a reference to St. Athanasius (which editors often suppress) unless, indeed, the reference is an interpolation. A fragment first printed by Routh from a Treatise "On Blasphemy" is generally regarded as spurious. A Coptic fragment on the keeping of Sunday, published by Schmidt (Texte und Untersuchung., IV) has been ruled spurious by Delehaye, in whose verdict critics seem to acquiesce. Other Coptic fragments have been edited with a translation by Crum in the "Journal of Theological Studies" (IV, 287 sqq.). Most of these come from the same <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> as the fragment edited by Schmidt. Their editor says: "It would be difficult to maintain the genuineness of these texts after Delehaye's criticisms (Anal. Bolland., XX, 101), though certain of the passages, which I have published may indicate interpolated, rather than wholly <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> compositions."

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">ROUTH, <em>Reliq. Sac.,</em> III, 319-72, gives most of the passages attributed to St. Peter. A translation of many of these, as well as of the martyrdom, will be found in CLARKE, <em>Ante-Nicene Christ. Library,</em> in vol. containing works of METHODIUS. For the Meletian schism: HEFELE, <em>Hist. of Councils,</em> tr. I, 341 sq. The best editions of the Canons is LAGARDE, <em>Reliq. Juris Eccles.,</em> 63-73. The latest edition of the martyrdom is VITEAU, <em>Passions des saints Ecaterine et Pierre d'Alexandrie, Barbara et Amysia</em> (Paris, 1897). See HARNACK, <em>Altchrist. Lit.,</em> 443-49; and <em>Chronologie,</em> 71-75. BARDENHEWER, <em>Gesch. d. altkirch. Lit.,</em> II, 203 sq.
