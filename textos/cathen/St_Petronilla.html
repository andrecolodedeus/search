<h1>St. Petronilla</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">Virgin</a>, probably <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at the end of the first century.

<p>Almost all the sixth- and seventh-century lists of the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the most highly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> mention St. Petronilla's grave as situated in the Via Ardeatina near Sts. Nereus and Achilleus (<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, "Roma sotterranea", I, 180-1). These notices have been completely confirmed by the excavations in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/06098b.htm">Domitilla</a>. One topography of the graves of the Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, "Epitome libri de locis sanctorum martyrum", locates on the Via Ardeatina a church of St. Petronilla, in which Sts. Nereus and Achilleus, as well as Petronilla, were buried (<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, loc. cit., 180). This church, built into the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a>, has been discovered, and the memorials found in it removed all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the three <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were once <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> there (De Rossi in "Bullettino di archeol. crist.", 1874 sq., 5 sqq.). A <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, in which Petronilla is represented as receiving a deceased <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> (named Veneranda) into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, was discovered on the closing stone of a <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> in an underground <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> behind the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> of the basilica (Wilpert, "Die Malereien der Katakomben Roms", Freiburg, 1903, plate 213; <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, ibid., 1875, 5 sqq.). Beside the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> picture is her name: <em>Petronilla Mart.</em> (yr). That the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> was done shortly after 356, is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by an inscription found in the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. It is thus clearly established that Petronilla was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> in the fourth century, and the testimony must be accepted as certainly historical, notwithstanding the later legend which recognizes her only as a virgin (see below). Another known, but unfortunately no longer extant, memorial was the marble sacrophagus which contained her remains, under <a href="../cathen/11577a.htm">Paul I</a> translated to St. Peter's. In the account of this in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> (ed. Duchesne, I, 466) the inscription carved on the sacrophagus is given thus: Aureae Petronillae Filiae Dulcissimae (of the golden Petronilla, the sweetest daughter). We learn, however, from extant sixteenth-century notices concerning this sacrophagus that the first word was Aur. (Aureliae), so that the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> name was Aurelia Petronilla. The second name comes from Petro or Petronius, and, as the name of the great-grandfather of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> consul, Flavius Clemens, was Titus Flavius Petronius, it is very possible that Petronilla was a relative of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Flavii, who were descended from the senatorial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Aurelii. This theory would also explain why Petronilla was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06098b.htm">Flavian Domitilla</a>. Like the latter, Petronilla may have suffered during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, perhaps not till later.

<p>In the fourth-century Roman catalogue of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs'</a> feasts, which is used in the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum", her name seems not to have been inserted. It occurs in the latter <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> (De Rossi-Duschesne, "Martyrol. Hieronym.", 69), but only as a later addition. Her name is given under 31 May and the Martyrologies of <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> and his imitators adopt the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> (Quentin, "Les martyrologes historiques", Paris, 1908, 51, 363, etc.). The absence of her name from the fourth-century Roman calendar of feasts suggests that Petronilla died at the end of the first or during the second century, since no special feasts for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were celebrated during this period. After the erection of the basilica over her remains and those of Sts. Nereus and Achilleus in the fourth century, her cult extended widely and her name was therefore admitted later into the <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a>. A legend, the existence of which in the sixth century is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by its presence in the list of the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> prepared by Abbot John at the end of this century (<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, "Roma sotterranea", I, 180), regards Petronilla as a real daughter of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> Acts of St. Peter, dating from the second century, a daughter of St. Peter is mentioned, although her name is not given (Schmid, "Ein voriren&ouml;ische gnostisches Originalwerk in koptischer Sprache" in "Sitzungsber. der Berliner Akademie", 1896, 839 sqq.; Lipsius, "Die apokryphen Apostelgeschichten u. Apostellegenden", II, i, <a href="../cathen/03019a.htm">Brunswick</a>, 1887, 203 sqq.). The legend being widely propagated by these <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> Acts, Petronilla was identified at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with this supposed daughter of St. Peter, probably because of her name and the great antiquity of her <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. As such, but now as a virgin, not as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, she appears in the legendary <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts of the martyrs</a> St. Nereus and Achilleus and in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> (loc. cit.). From this legend of Sts. Nereus and Achilleus a similar notice was admitted into the historical <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> and thence into the modern Roman Martyrology. In 757 the coffin containing the mortal remains of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was transferred to an old circular building (an imperial mausoleum <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the end of the fourth century) near St. Peter's. This building was altered and became the Chapel of St. Petronilla (<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, "Inscriptiones christianae urbis Romae", II, 225). The saint subsequently appears as the special patroness of the treaties concluded between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> emperors. At the rebuilding of St. Peter's in the sixteenth century, St. Petronilla's remains were translated to an altar (still dedicated to her) in the upper end of the right side-aisle (near the <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a>). Her feast falls on 31 May.
