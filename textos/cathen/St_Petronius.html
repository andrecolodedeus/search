<h1>St. Petronius</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bologna, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; died before 450. The only certain historical information we possess concerning him is derived from a letter written by Bishop Eucherius of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> (died 450-5) to Valerianus (in P.L., L, 711 sqq.) and from <a href="../cathen/06417a.htm">Gennadius'</a> "De viris illustribus", XLI (ed. Czapla, M&uuml;nster, 1898, p. 94). Eucherius writes that the holy Bishop Petronius was then renowned in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> for his virtues. From <a href="../cathen/06417a.htm">Gennadius</a> we receive more detailed information: Petronius belonged to a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> whose members occupied high positions at the imperial Court at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and in the provincial administrations at the end of the fourth and the beginning of the fifth centuries. His father (also named Petronius) was probably <em>pr&oelig;fectus pr&oelig;torio</em>, since a Petronius filled this office in Gaul in 402-8. Eucherius seems to suggest (P.L., L, 719) that the future <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> also held an important secular position. Even in his youth Petronius devoted himself to the practices of asceticism, and seems to have visited the Holy Places in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, perhaps on a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>. About 432 he was elected and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bologna, where he erected a church to St. Stephen, the building scheme of which was in imitation of the shrines on Golgotha and over the Holy Sepulchre in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The buildings belong approximately to the period when <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a> had <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> erected in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Galla Placidia in <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. Petronius is believed to have written a work on the life of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> (Vit&aelig; patrum &AElig;gypti monachorum); the author of this work, however, is Rufinus of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>. The treatise "De ordinatione episcopi", bearing the name of Petronius as author, is by the elder Petronius, who was a man of eloquence and wide acquaintance with the secular <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. Morin has published a sermon entitled "In die ordinationis vel Natale episcopi" (Revue b&eacute;n&eacute;dictine, 1897, 3 sq.), which <a href="../cathen/06417a.htm">Gennadius</a> ascribes to Bishop Petronius of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, whom Czalpa holds is Petronius of Bologna, but this assignment is not certain. According to <a href="../cathen/06417a.htm">Gennadius</a>, Petronius died during the reign of <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a> and Valentinian, i.e., before 450. In the twelfth century appeared a legendary life of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were discovered in 1141. Shortly afterwards a church was erected in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> at Bologna; a second, planned on a large seal, was begun in 1390, and built as far as the cross-aisle. In 1659 the building was resumed and the glorious Italian-Gothic church completed as it stands today. The feast of St. Petronius is celebrated on 4 October.
