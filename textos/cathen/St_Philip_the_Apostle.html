<h1>St. Philip the Apostle</h1>  

<p>Like the brothers, Peter and Andrew, Philip was a native of <a href="../cathen/02536a.htm">Bethsaida</a> on <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">Lake Genesareth</a> (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs44">John 1:44</a>). He also was among those surrounding the <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">Baptist</a> when the latter first pointed out <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> as the Lamb of God. On the day after Peter's call, when about to set out for <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> met Philip and called him to the Apostolate with the words, "Follow me". Philip obeyed the call, and a little later brought <a href="../cathen/10711b.htm">Nathaniel</a> as a new disciple (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs43">John 1:43-45</a>). On the occasion of the selection and sending out of the twelve, Philip is included among the Apostles proper. His name stands in the fifth place in the three lists (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs2">Matthew 10:2-4</a>; <a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs14">Mark 3:14-19</a>; <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#vrs13">Luke 6:13-16</a>) after the two pairs of brothers, Peter and Andrew, James and John. The <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a> records three episodes concerning Philip which occurred during the epoch of the public teaching of the Saviour: <ul> <li>Before the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> feeding of the multitude, Christ turns towards Philip with the question: "Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?" to which the Apostle answers: "Two hundred penny-worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one may take a little" (vi, 5-7). <li>When some <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> came to Philip and expressed their desire to see <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, Philip reported the fact to Andrew and then both brought the news to the Saviour (xii, 21-23). <li>When Philip, after Christ had spoken to His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> of knowing and seeing the Father, said to Him: "Lord, shew us the Father, and it is enough for us", he received the answer: "He that seeth me, seeth the Father also" (xiv, 8-9). </ul> These three episodes furnish a consistent character-sketch of Philip as a na&iuml;ve, somewhat shy, sober-minded man. No additional characteristics are given in the Gospels or the Acts although he is mentioned in the latter work (<a href="../bible/act001.htm">1:13</a>) as belonging to the Apostolic College.

<p>The second-century tradition concerning him is uncertain, inasmuch as a similar tradition is recorded concerning Philip the Deacon and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> &#151; a phenomenon which must be the result of confusion caused by the existence of the two Philips. In his letter to St. Victor, written about 189-98, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Polycrates of Ephesus mentions among the "great lights", whom the Lord will seek on the "last day", "Philip, one of the Twelve Apostles, who is buried in Hieropolis with his two daughters, who grew old as virgins", and a third daughter, who "led a life in the Holy Ghost and rests in Ephesus." On the other hand, according to the Dialogue of Caius, directed against a <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanist</a> named Proclus, the latter declared that "there were four prophetesses, the daughters of Philip, at Hieropolis in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> where their and their father's grave is still situated." The Acts (<a href="../bible/act021.htm">21:8-9</a>) does indeed mention four prophetesses, the daughters of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and "Evangelist" Philip, as then living in Caesarea with their father, and <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> who gives the above-mentioned excerpts (<a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.32</a>), refers Proclus' statement to these latter. The statement of Bishop Polycrates carries in itself more authority, but it is extraordinary that three virgin daughters of the Apostle Philip (two buried in Hieropolis) should be mentioned, and that the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Philip should also have four daughters, said to have been buried in Hieropolis. Here also perhaps we must suppose a confusion of the two Philips to have taken place, although it is difficult to decide which of the two, the Apostle or the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, was buried in Hieropolis. Many modern historians believe that it was the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>; it is, however, possible that the Apostle was buried there and that the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> also lived and worked there and was there buried with three of his daughters and that the latter were afterwards <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> regarded as the children of the Apostle. The <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> "Acts of Philip," which are, however purely legendary and a tissue of fables, also refer Philip's death to Hieropolis. The remains of the Philip who was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in Hieropolis were later translated (as those of the Apostle) to Constantinople and thence to the church of the Dodici Apostoli in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the Apostle is celebrated in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> on 1 May (together with that of James the Younger), and in the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> on 14 November. [<em>Editor's Note:</em> The feast is now celebrated on 3 May in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>.]
