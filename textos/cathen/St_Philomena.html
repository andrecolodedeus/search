<h1>St. Philomena</h1>  

<p>On 25 May, 1802, during the quest for the graves of Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Priscilla, a <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> was discovered and opened; as it contained a glass vessel it was assumed to be the grave of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. The view, then <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> entertained in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, that the presence of such vessels (supposed to have contained the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> blood) in a grave was a symbol of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, has been rejected in practice since the investigations of <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> (cf. Leclercq in "Dict. d.arch&eacute;ol. chr&eacute;t. et de liturg.", s.v. Ampoules de sang). The remains found in the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> were shown to be those of a young maiden, and, as the name Filumena was discovered on the earthenware slabs closing the grave, it was assumed that they were those of a virgin <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> named Philumena. On 8 June, 1805, the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were translated to the church of Mungano, <a href="../cathen/11089b.htm">Diocese of Nola</a> (near <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>), and enshrined under one of its altars. In 1827 <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> presented the church with the three earthenware tiles, with the inscription, which may be seen in the church even today. On the basis of alleged revelations to a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and of an entirely fanciful and indefensible explanation of the allegorical <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, which were found on the slabs beside the inscription, a canon of the church in Mugnano, named Di Lucia, composed a purely fictitious and romantic account of the supposed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of St. Philomena, who is not mentioned in any of the ancient sources. In consequence of the wonderful favours received in answer to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> before the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> at Mugnano, devotion to them spread rapidly, and, after instituting investigations into the question, <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> appointed a special feast to be held on 9 September, "in honorem s. Philumenae virginis et martyris" (cf. the lessons of this feast in the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a>). The earthenware plates were fixed in front of the grave as follows: LUMENA PAX TECUM FI. The plates were evidently inserted in the wrong order, and the inscription should doubtless read PAX TECUM FILUMENA. The letters are <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> on the plates with red <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a>, and the inscription belongs to the primitive class of epigraphical memorials in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Priscilla, thus, dating from about the middle or second half of the second century. The disarrangement of the inscription proves that it must have been completed before the plates were put into position, although in the numerous other examples of this kind in the same <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> the inscription was added only after the grave had been closed. Consequently, since the disarrangement of the plates can scarcely be explained as arising from an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, Marucchi seems justified in concluding that the inscription and plates originally belonged to an earlier grave, and were later employed (now in the wrong order) to close another. Apart from the letters, the plates contain three arrows, either as a decoration or a punctuation, a leaf as decoration, two anchors, and a palm as the well-known <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> symbols. Neither these signs nor the glass vessel discovered in the grave can be regarded as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.
