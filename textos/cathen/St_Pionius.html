<h1>St. Pionius</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyred</a> at <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>, 12 March, 250. Pionius, with Sabina and Asclepiades, was arrested on 23 February, the anniversary of <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">St. Polycarp's</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. They had passed the previous night in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. Knowing of his impending arrest, Pionius had fastened fetters round the necks of himself and his companions to signify that they were already condemned. People seeing them led off unbound might suppose that they were prepared, like so many other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> included, to sacrifice. Early in the morning, after they had partaken of the Holy Bread and of water, they were conducted to the forum. The place was thronged with Greeks and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, for it was a great <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> and therefore a general holiday in the city &#151; an indication of the importance of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>. Pionius harangued the multitude. He begged the Greeks to remember what Homer had said about not mocking the corpse of an enemy. Let them refrain therefore from mocking those <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who had <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a>. He then turned to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and quoted <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Solomon to the same effect. He ended with a vehement refusal to offer sacrifice. Then followed the usual interrogatories and threats, after which Pionius and his companions were relegated to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, to await the arrival of the proconsul. Here they found other confessors, among them a <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanist</a>. Many <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> visited them, and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who had sacrificed, lamenting their fall. The latter Pionius exhorted to repentance. A further attempt before the arrival of the proconsul was made to force Pionius and his companions into an act of apostasy. They were carried off to a temple where every effort was made to compel them to participate in a sacrifice. On 12 March, Pionius was brought before the proconsul who first tried persuasion and then torture. Both having failed, Pionius was condemned to be burnt alive. He suffered in company with Metrodorus, a <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcionite</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept by the Latins ion 1 Feb.; by the Greeks on 11 March. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> day of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, according to the Acts, was 12 March. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/2501.htm"><em>Church History</em></a>; "Chron.", p. 17, ed. Schoene) places the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in the reign of <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus</a>. His mistake was probably due to the fact that he found the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of Pionius in a volume containing the <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts of Martyrs</a> of an earlier date. Possibly his <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> lacked the chronological note in our present ones. For the life of <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> by Pionius, see <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">SAINT POLYCARP</a>. Did Pionius before his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> celebrate with bread and water? We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> (Ep. 63) that this abuse existed in his time. But note (1) the bread is spoken of as Holy, but not the water; (2) it is unlikely that Pionius would celebrate with only two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> present. It is more likely therefore that we have an account, not of a celebration, but of a private Communion (see Funk, "Abhandlungen", I, 287).
