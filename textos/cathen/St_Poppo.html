<h1>St. Poppo</h1>  

<p>Abbot, born 977; died at Marchiennes, 25 January, 1048. He belonged to a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>; his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were Tizekinus and Adalwif. About the year 1000 he made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the Holy Land with two others of his countrymen. Soon after this he also went on a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was about to marry a lady of noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, when an impressive experience led him to seek another mode of life. As he was journeying late at night a flame burst forth over his head and his lance radiated a brilliant light. He believed this to be an illumination of the Holy Spirit, and soon after, 1005, he entered the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Thierry at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. About 1008 Abbot Richard of St. Vannes at <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>, who was a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> reformer of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the spirit of the reform of Cluny, took Poppo with him to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Richard made Poppo <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of St. Vaast d'Arras, in the <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Diocese of Cambrai</a>, about 1013. Here Poppo proved himself to be the right man for the position, reclaimed the lands of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> from the rapacious vassals, and secured the possession of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> by deeds. Before 1016 he was appointed to the same position at Vasloges (<em>Beloacum,</em> Beaulieu) in the <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Diocese of Verdun</a>. In 1020 the Emperor Henry II, who had become acquainted with Poppo in 1016, made him <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the royal Abbeys of Stablo (in Lower Lorraine, now <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>) and Malmedy. Richard was very unwilling to lose him. Poppo also received in 1023 the Abbey of St. Maximin at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and his importance became still greater during the reign of Conrad II. From St. Maximin the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> reform now found its way into the German <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. The emperor placed one royal <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> after another under Poppo's control or supervision, as Limburg an der Hardt, Echternach, St. Gislen, Weissenburg, St. Gall, Hersfeld, Waulsort, and Hosti&egrave;res. In the third decade of the century Poppo gave these positions as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> to his pupils. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> who had founded <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> placed a series of other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> under his care, as St. Laurence at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, St. Vincent at <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, <a href="../cathen/05594a.htm">St. Eucharius</a> at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, Hohorst, Brauweiler, St. Vaast, Marchiennes, etc. However, the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> reform had at the time no permanent success in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were accustomed to a more independent and individual way of action and raised opposition. After 1038 the German court no longer supported the reform.

<p>Personally Poppo practised the most severe asceticism. He had no interest in literary affairs, and also lacked the powers of organization and centralization. Neither was he particularly prominent in politics, and in the reign of Henry III he was no longer a person of importance. Death overtook him while he was on a journey on behalf of his efforts at monastic reform. His funeral took place in the presence of a great concourse of people at Stablo.
