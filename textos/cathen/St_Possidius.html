<h1>St. Possidius</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03148c.htm">Calama</a> in Numidia, author of a short life of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and of an <em>indiculus</em> or list of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine's</a> writings. The dates of his birth and death are unknown; he was alive and in exile in 437 according to Prosper, who, in his "Chronicle", records that Possidius and two other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> and expelled from their sees by the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandal</a> king, Genseric, who was an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>. Possidius (Vita S. Augustini, xxxi), after describing the death of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, speaks of his unbroken friendship with him for forty years. He also, speaking of himself in the third <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, lets it be known that he was one of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of St. Augustine's <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (ibid., xii). The date of his promotion to the episcopate was, according to <a href="../cathen/14724b.htm">Tillemont</a>, about 397. He followed St. Augustine's example and established a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/03148c.htm">Calama</a>. At a council, held at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, Possidius challenged Crispinus, the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03148c.htm">Calama</a>, to a public discussion which the latter declined. Shortly afterwards one of Crispinus's <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, bearing the same name as his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, attempted to assassinate Possidius. Legal proceedings were instituted against Crispinus, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who refused to punish his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>. He was proved to be a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> and was heavily fined, but at the intercession of Possidius the fine was not exacted ("Vita", xii; <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, "Ep.", cv, 4; "Contra Crescon.", III, xlvi). In 407, Possidius served, with <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and five other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, on a committee appointed to adjudicate upon some <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matter, the particulars of which are not known. In 408 he nearly lost his life in a riot stirred up by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> at Callama (<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, "Epp.", xc, xci, xciii). In 409 he was one of four <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> deputed to go to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to obtain the protection of the emperor against the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>. He was one of the seven <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> chosen to represent the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party at the "Collatio" of 411. In 416 he assisted at the Council of <a href="../cathen/10304b.htm">Milevum</a>, where fifty-nine Numidian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> addressed a synodal letter to <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a>, asking him to take action against <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>. He joined with <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and three other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in a further letter to <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent</a> on the same subject, and was at the conference between <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> Emeritus. When the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> invaded Africa, he fled to Hippo and was present at the death of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (430). His "Vita S. Augustini", composed before the capture of Carthage (439), is included in all editions of the works of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, and also printed in <a href="../cathen/07583c.htm">Hurter's</a> "Opusc. SS. Patr.". His <em>indiculus</em> will be found in the last volume of <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne's</a> edition of the works of .htm-->St. Augustine and in the tenth volume of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> edition.
