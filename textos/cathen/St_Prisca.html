<h1>St. Prisca</h1>  

<p>She was a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, whose dates are unknown. The name Prisca or Priscilla is often mentioned by early authorities of the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The wife of <a href="../cathen/01661a.htm">Aquila</a>, the pupil of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, bore this name. The grave of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Prisca was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Roman Catacomb</a> of Priscilla on the Via Salaria. The place of interment is explicitly mentioned in all the seventh-century itineraries to the graves of the Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> (<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, "Roma sotterranea", I, 176, 177). The epitaph of a Roman <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> named Priscilla was found in the "larger Catacomb", the <em>Coemeterium</em> maius, on the Via Nomentana, not far from the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of St. Agnes [<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. di arch. crist. (1888-1889), 130, note 5]. There still exists on the Aventine a church of St. Prisca. It stands on the site of a very early title church, the <em>Titulus Priscoe</em>, mentioned in the fifth century and built probably in the fourth. In the eighteenth century there was found near this church a bronze tablet with an inscription of the year 224, by which a senator named Caius Marius Pudens Cornelianus was granted citizenship in a Spanish city. As such tablets were generally put up in the house of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> so <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a>, it is possible that the senator's palace stood on the spot where the church was built later. The assumption is probable that the Prisca who founded this title church, or who, perhaps as early as the third century, gave the use of a part of the house standing there for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> church services, belonged to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Pudens Cornelianus. Whether the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> buried in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Priscilla belonged to the same <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> or was identical with the founder of the title church cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. Still some <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> relationship is probable, because the name Priscilla appears also in the senatorial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Acilii Glabriones, whose burial-place was in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Priscilla on the Via Salaria. The "Martyrologium Hieronymianum" mentions under 18 January a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Priscilla on the Via Salaria (ed. De Rossi-Duchesne, 10). This Priscilla is evidently identical with the Prisca whose grave was in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Priscilla and who is mentioned in the itineraries of the seventh century. Later legendary traditions identified the founder of the <em>Titulus Priscoe</em> with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> friend, Priscilla, whose home would have occupied the spot on which the church was later erected. It was from here that St. Paul sent a greeting in his Epistle to the Romans. Another legend relates the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of a Prisca who was beheaded at the tenth milestone on the Via Ostiensis, and whose body <a href="../cathen/05638a.htm">Pope Eutychianus</a> is said to have translated to the church of Prisca on the Aventine. The whole narrative is unhistorical and its details impossible. As 18 January is also assigned as the day of the execution of this Priscilla, she is probably the same as the Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> buried in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Priscilla. Her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is observed on 18 January.
