<h1>St. Proclus</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople.

<p>Saint Proclus died in 446 or 447. Proclus came to the fore in the time of Atticus, the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople who succeeded (406) Arsacius who had been intruded upon the patriarchal throne after the violent deposition of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> (404). "Proclus was a Lector at a very early age, and, assiduously frequenting the Schools, became devoted to the study of rhetoric. On attaining manhood he was in the habit of constant intercourse with Atticus, having been constituted his secretary" (<a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, "H.E.", VII, xl). From Atticus he received the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> and <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> (ibid.). When Atticus died (425), there was a strong party in favour of Proclus, but Sissinius was eventually chosen as his successor. Sissinius appointed him <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a>; but the Cyzicans chose a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of their own, and no attempt was made to force Proclus upon a reluctant people. Sissinius died at the end of 427, and again Proclus was likely to be appointed to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, but eventually Nestorius was chosen. Nestorius was deposed at the Council of Ephesus (431) and Proclus was on the point of being made patriarch, but "some influential <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> interfered on the ground of its being forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> canon that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> nominated to one <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> should be translated to another" (Soc., VII, xxxv). In consequence a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Maximian, was appointed, upon whose death (434) Proclus succeeded. "The <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a> wishing to prevent the disturbances which usually attend the election of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, directed the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who were then in the city to place Proclus in the episcopal chair before the body of Maximian was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a>, for he had received letters from Celestine, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>, approving of this election" (Soc., VII, xl). In 438 Proclus brought the body of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> to Constantinople and placed it in the church of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. In 436 some <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> consulted him about some propositions attributed to <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a> which were being put forward by the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>. Proclus replied in an epistle (often called the "Tome of St. Proclus"), in which he required the propositions to be condemned. Here a difficulty arose. People were ready to condemn the propositions but not the memory of Theodore. Proclus met this difficulty by disclaiming any intention of attributing the propositions to Theodore. Volusianus, the uncle of Melania the Younger, was converted and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by him. The writings of Proclus, consisting chiefly of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> and epistles, were first printed by Ricardus (Rome, 1630), reprinted in <a href="../cathen/06349c.htm">Gallandi</a>, IX; also in P.G., LXV, 651.
