<h1>St. Raphael</h1>  

<p>The name of this archangel (<em>Raphael</em> = "<a href="../cathen/05393a.htm">God</a> has healed") does not appear in the Hebrew Scriptures, and in the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> only in the Book of Tobias. Here he first appears disguised in human form as the travelling companion of the younger Tobias, calling himself "Azarias the son of the great Ananias". The story of the adventurous journey during which the protective influence of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is shown in many ways including the binding "in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of upper <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>" of the demon who had previously slain seven husbands of Sara, daughter of Raguel, is picturesquely related in Tobit 5-11, to which the reader is referred. After the return and the healing of the blindness of the elder Tobias, Azarias makes himself known as "the angel Raphael, one of the seven, who stand before the Lord" (<a href="../bible/tob012.htm#vrs15">Tobit 12:15</a>. Cf. <a href="../bible/rev008.htm#vrs2">Revelation 8:2</a>). Of these seven "archangels" which appear in the angelology of post-Exilic <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, only three, Gabriel, Michael and Raphael, are mentioned in the canonical Scriptures. The others, according to the Book of Enoch (cf. xxi) are Uriel, Raguel, Sariel, and Jerahmeel, while from other <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> sources we get the variant names Izidkiel, Hanael, and Kepharel instead of the last three in the other list.

<p>Regarding the functions attributed to Raphael we have little more than his declaration to Tobias (Tobit 12) that when the latter was occupied in his works of mercy and charity, he (Raphael) offered his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to the Lord, that he was sent by the Lord to heal him of his blindness and to deliver Sara, his son's wife, from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. The Jewish category of the archangels is recognized in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> (<a href="../bible/1th004.htm#vrs15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>; <a href="../bible/jud001.htm#vrs9">Jude 9</a>), but only Gabriel and Michael are mentioned by name. Many commentators, however, identify Raphael with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">"angel of the Lord"</a> mentioned in <a href="../bible/joh005.htm">John 5</a>. This conjecture is base both on the significance of the name and on the healing role attributed to Raphael in the Book of Tobias. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> assigns the feast of St. Raphael to 24 October.  The <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> of the Office recall the healing power of the archangel and his victory over the demon. The lessons of the first <a href="../cathen/11087b.htm">Nocturn</a> and the Antiphons of the entire Office are taken from the Book of Tobias, and the lessons of the second and third <a href="../cathen/11087b.htm">Nocturns</a> from the works of St. Augustine, viz. for the second <a href="../cathen/11087b.htm">Nocturn</a> a sermon on Tobias (sermon I on the fifteenth Sunday), and for the third, a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> on the opening verse of <a href="../bible/joh005.htm">John 5</a>. The Epistle of the Mass is taken from the twelfth chapter of Tobias, and the Gospel from <a href="../bible/joh005.htm#vrs1">John 5:1-4</a>, referring to the pool called Probatica, where the multitude of the infirm lay awaiting the moving of the water, for "an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> descended at certain times into the pond; and the water was moved.And he that went down first into the pond after the motion of the water was made whole of whatsoever infirmity he lay under". Thus the conjecture of the commentators referred to above is confirmed by the official Liturgy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
