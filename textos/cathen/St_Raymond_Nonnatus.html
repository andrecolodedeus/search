<h1>St. Raymond Nonnatus</h1>  

<p>(In <a href="../cathen/14192a.htm">Spanish</a> SAN RAMON).

<p>Born 1200 or 1204 at Portello in the <a href="../cathen/15223b.htm">Diocese of Urgel</a> in Catalonia; died at Cardona, 31 August, 1240. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 31 August. He is pictured in the habit of his order surrounded by ransomed slaves, with a padlock on his lips. He was taken from the womb of his mother after her death, hence his name. Of noble but poor <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, he showed early traits of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and great talent. His father ordered him to tend a farm, but later gave him permission to take the habit with the <a href="../cathen/10197b.htm">Mercedarians</a> at <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, at the hands of the founder, <a href="../cathen/11770b.htm">St. Peter Nolasco</a>. Raymond made such progress in the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> that he was soon considered worthy to succeed his master in the office of ransomer. He was sent to Algiers and liberated many captives. When money failed he gave himself as a hostage. He was <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in teaching the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> and made many converts, which embittered the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> authorities. Raymond was subjected to all kinds of indignities and cruelty, was made to run the gauntlet, and was at last sentenced to impalement. The hope of a greater sum of money as ransom caused the governor to commute the sentence into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. To prevent him from preaching for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, his lips were pierced with a red-hot iron and closed with a padlock. After his arrival in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, in 1239, he was made a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>. In the next year he was called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">pope</a>, but came only as far as Cardona, about six miles from Barcelona, where he died. His body was brought to the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Nicholas near his old farm. In 1657 his name was placed in the Roman <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> by <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>. He is invoked by <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in labour and by <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> falsely accused. The appendix to the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman ritual</a> gives a formula for the blessing of water, in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, to be used by the sick, and another of candles.
