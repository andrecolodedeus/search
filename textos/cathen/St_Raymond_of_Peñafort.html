<h1>St. Raymond of Pe&ntilde;afort</h1>  

<p>Born at Villafranca de Benadis, near <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, in 1175; died at <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, 6 January, 1275. He became professor of canon law in 1195, and taught for fifteen years. He left <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> for Bologna in 1210 to complete his studies in canon law. He occupied a chair of canon law in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> for three years and published a treatise on <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation which still exists in the Vatican Library.

<p>Raymond was attracted to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> by the preaching of Blessed Reginald, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> of Bologna, and received the habit in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Convent of <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, whither he had returned from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in 1222. At <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona</a> he was co-founder with <a href="../cathen/11770b.htm">St. Peter Nolasco</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10197b.htm">Order of Mercedarians</a>. He also founded institutes at <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona</a> and <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a> for the study of Oriental languages, to convert the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.

<p>At the request of his superiors Raymond published the <em>Summa Casuum</em>, of which several editions appeared in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In 1229 Raymond was appointed <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and penitentiary to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Sabina, John of Abbeville, and was summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1230 by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, who appointed him <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> and grand penitentiary.

<p>The reputation of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> for juridical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> decided the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to employ Raymond of Pe&ntilde;afort's talents in re-arranging and codifying the canons of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He had to rewrite and condense decrees that had been multiplying for centuries, and which were contained in some twelve or fourteen collections already existing. We learn from a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> to the Universities of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Bologna that many of the decrees in the collections were but repetitions of ones issued before, many contradicted what had been determined in previous decrees, and many on account of their great length led to endless confusion, while others had never been embodied in any collection and were of uncertain authority.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> announced the new publication in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> directed to the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> and students of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Bologna in 1231, and commanded that the work of St. Raymond alone should be considered authoritative, and should alone be used in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. When Raymond completed his work the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> appointed him <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> declined the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. Having edited the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> he returned to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. He was not allowed to remain long in seclusion, as he was elected General of the Order in 1238; but he resigned two years later. During his tenure of office he published a revised edition of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Constitutions, and it was at his request that <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> wrote the <em>Summa Contra Gentiles</em>. St. Raymond was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> in 1601. His <em>Summa de Poenitentia et Matrimonio</em> is said to be the first work of its kind. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is 23 January.
