<h1>St. Remigius</h1>  

<p>Apostle of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, b. at Cerny or Laon, 437; d. at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, 13 January 533. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated 1 October. His father was Emile, Count of Laon. He studied literature at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> and soon became so noted for learning and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> that he was elected <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a> in his twenty-second year. Thence-forward his chief aim was the propagation of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in the realm of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>. The story of the return of the <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a>, which had been <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">stolen</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a> testifies to the friendly relations existing between him and <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a>, King of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, whom he <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> with the assistance of St. Waast (Vedastus, Vaast) and <a href="../cathen/04066a.htm">St. Clotilda</a>, wife of <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a>. Even before he embraced <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a> had showered benefits upon both the Bishop and Cathedral of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, and after the battle of Tolbiac, he requested Remigius to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> him at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> (24 December, 496) in presence of several <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> and Alemanni and great numbers of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> army. <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a> granted Remigius stretches of territory, in which the latter established and endowed many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>. He erected, with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> consent, <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> at <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>; Cambrai; Terouanne, where he <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 499; Arras, where he placed St. Waast; Laon, which he gave to his nephew Gunband. The authors of <a href="../cathen/06350c.htm">"Gallia Christiana"</a> record numerous and munificent donations made to St. Remigius by members of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> nobility, which he presented to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. In 517 he held a synod, at which after a heated discussion he converted a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> views. In 523 he wrote congratulating Pope Hormisdas upon his election. <a href="../cathen/10115b.htm">St. Medardus</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Noyon, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by him in 530. Although St. Remigius's influence over people and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> was extraordinary, yet upon one occasion, the history of which has come down to us, his course of action was attacked. His condonement of the offences of one Claudius, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, brought upon him the rebukes of his episcopal brethren, who deemed Claudius deserving of degradation. The reply of St. Remigius, which is still extant, is able and convincing (cf. Labbe, "Concilia", IV). His <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were kept in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, whence <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar</a> had them translated to Epernay during the period of the invasion by the <a href="../cathen/11115b.htm">Northmen</a>, thence, in 1099, at the instance of <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a>, to the Abbey of Saint-Remy. His sermons, so much admired by Sidonius Apollinaris (lib. IX, cap. lxx), are not extant. On his other works we have four letters, the one containing his defence in the matter of Claudius, two written to <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a>, and a fourth to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tongres. According to several biographers, the Testament of St. Remigius is <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>; <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> and <a href="../cathen/05181b.htm">Ducange</a>, however, argue for its authenticity. The attribution of other works to St. Remigius, particularly a commentary upon <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a>, is entirely without foundation.
