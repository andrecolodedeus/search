<div id="springfield2">
<h1>St. Richard de Wyche</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> and confessor, b. about 1197 at Droitwich, Worcestershire, from which his surname is derived; d. 3 April, 1253, at Dover. He was the second son of Richard and Alice de Wyche. His father died while he was still young and the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> fell into a state of great delapidation. His elder brother offered to resign the inheritance to him, but Richard refused the offer, although he undertook the management of the estate and soon restored it to a good condition. He went to <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, where he and two companions lived in such poverty that they had only one tunic and hooded gown between them, in which they attended lectures by turns. He then went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and on his return proceeded Master of Arts. At Bologna he studied canon law, in which he acquired a great reputation and was elected Chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">University of Oxford</a>.

<p>His learning and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> were so famed that Edmund Rich, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07037a.htm">Robert Grosseteste</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lincoln, both offered him the post of chancellor of their respective <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Richard accepted the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> offer and thenceforward became St. Edmund's intimate friend and follower. He approved the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> action in opposing the king on the question of the vacant sees, accompanied him in his exile to <a href="../cathen/12233a.htm">Pontigny</a>, was present at Soissy when he died, and made him a model in life. Richard supplied <a href="../cathen/11499a.htm">Matthew Paris</a> with material for his biography, and, after attending the translation of his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> to <a href="../cathen/12233a.htm">Pontigny</a> in 1249, wrote an account of the incident in a letter published by <a href="../cathen/11499a.htm">Matthew Paris</a> (Historia major, V, VI). Retiring to the house of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, Richard studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and, after founding a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Edmund, returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> where he became Vicar of Deal and Rector of Charring. Soon afterwards he was induced by <a href="../cathen/02672a.htm">Boniface of Savoy</a>, the new <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, to resume his former office of chancellor.

<p>In 1244 Ralph Neville, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03657a.htm">Chichester</a>, died; the election of Robert Passelewe, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/03657a.htm">Chichester</a>, to the vacant see, was quashed by Boniface at a synod of his suffragans, held 3 June, 1244, and on his recommendation the chapter elected Richard, their choice being immediately confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Henry III was indignant, as Robert Passelewe was a favourite, and he refused to surrender to Richard the temporalities of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. The Saint took his case to <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, who <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him in person at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, 5 March, 1245, and sent him back to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. But Henry was immovable. Thus homeless in his own diocese, Richard was dependent on the charity of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, one of whom, Simon of Tarring, shared with him the little he possessed. At length, in 1246, Henry was induced by the threats of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to deliver up the temporalities. As <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Richard lived in great austerity, giving away most of his revenues as <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. He compiled a number of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> which regulate in great detail the lives of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the celebration of Divine service, the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, church privileges, and other matters. Every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was bound to obtain a copy of these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> and bring it to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod (Wilkins, "Concilia", I, 688-93); in this way the standard of life among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> was raised considerably. For the better maintenance of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> Richard instituted a yearly collection to be made in every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> or Whit Sunday. The <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a>, particularly the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, received special encouragement from him.

<p>In 1250 Richard was named as one of the collectors of the subsidy for the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a> (Bliss, "Calendar of Papal Letters", I, 263) and two years later the king appointed him to preach the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. He made strenuous efforts to rouse enthusiasm for the cause in the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/03657a.htm">Chichester</a> and Canterbury, and while journeying to Dover, where he was to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> a new church dedicated to St. Edmund, he was taken ill. Upon reaching Dover, he went to a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> called "Maison Dieu", performed the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> on 2 April, but died the next morning. His body was taken back to Chichester and buried in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> church at <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, 1262, and on 20 Feb. a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> licence for the translation of his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> to a new shrine was given; but the unsettled state of the country prevented this until 16 June, 1276, when the translation was performed by <a href="../cathen/08644a.htm">Archbishop Kilwardby</a> in the presence of Edward I. This shrine, which stood in the feretory behind the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>, was rifled and destroyed at the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The much-restored <a href="../cathen/01357c.htm">altar tomb</a> in the south <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> now commonly assigned to St. Richard has no evidence to support its claim, and no <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are known to exist. The feast is celebrated on 3 April. The most accurate version of St. Richard's will, which has been frequently printed, is that given by Blaauw in "Sussex Archaeological Collections", I, 164-92, with a translation and valuable notes. His life was written by his confessor Ralph Bocking shortly after his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> and another short life, compiled in the fifteenth century, was printed by Capgrave. Both these are included in the notice of St. Richard in the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandist</a> "Acta Sanctorum".
