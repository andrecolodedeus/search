<h1>St. Rita of Cascia</h1>  

<p>Born at Rocca Porena in the <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Diocese of Spoleto</a>, 1386; died at the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Augustinian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Cascia, 1456. <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">Feast</a>, 22 May. Represented as holding roses, or roses and figs, and sometimes with a <a href="../cathen/14294b.htm">wound</a> in her forehead.

<p>According to the "Life" (Acta SS., May, V, 224) written at the time of her <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Augustinian</a>, Jacob Carelicci, from two older biographies, she was the daughter of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> advanced in years and distinguished for <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charity</a> which merited them the surname of "Peacemakers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>". Rita's great desire was to become a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>, but, in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the will of her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, she, at the age of twelve, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> a man extremely cruel and ill-tempered. For eighteen years she was a model wife and mother. When her husband was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> she tried in vain to dissuade her twin sons from attempting to take revenge; she appealed to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> to prevent such a crime on their part, and they were taken away by death, reconciled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. She applied for admission to the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Augustinian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Cascia, but, being a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, was refused. By continued entreaties, and, as is related, by Divine intervention, she gained admission, received the habit of the order and in due <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> her <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">profession</a>. As a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> she was an example for all, excelled in <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortifications</a>, and was widely known for the efficacy of her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, in 1637, permitted her <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> and <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a>. On account of the many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> reported to have been wrought at her <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a> she received in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> the title of <em>La Santa de los impossibiles</em>. She was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> 24 May, 1900.
