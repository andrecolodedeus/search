<h1>St. Robert Francis Romulus Bellarmine</h1>  

<p>(Also, "Bellarmino").

<p>A distinguished <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, writer, and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/10531a.htm">Montepulciano</a>, 4 October, 1542; died 17 September, 1621. His father was Vincenzo Bellarmino, his mother Cinthia Cervini, sister of Cardinal Marcello Cervini, afterwards Pope Marcellus II. He was brought up at the newly founded <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in his native town, and entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> on 20 September, 1560, being admitted to his first <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> on the following day. The next three years he spent in studying <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at the Roman College, after which he taught the humanities first at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, then at <a href="../cathen/10478a.htm">Mondov&igrave;</a>. In 1567 he began his <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, but in 1569 was sent to finish it at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, where he could obtain a fuller acquaintance with the prevailing <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. Having been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> there, he quickly obtained a reputation both as a professor and a preacher, in the latter capacity drawing to his <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> both <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, even from distant parts. In 1576 he was recalled to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and entrusted with the chair of Controversies recently founded at the Roman College. He proved himself equal to the arduous task, and the lectures thus delivered grew into the work "De Controversiis" which, amidst so much else of excellence, forms the chief title to his greatness. This monumental work was the earliest attempt to systematize the various controversies of the time, and made an immense impression throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, the blow it dealt to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> being so acutely felt in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> that special chairs were founded in order to provide replies to it. Nor has it even yet been superseded as the classical book on its subject-matter, though, as was to be expected, the progress of criticism has impaired the value of some of its historical arguments.

<p>In 1588 Bellarmine was made Spiritual Father to the Roman College, but in 1590 he went with Cardinal Gaetano as <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> to the embassy <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> was then sending into <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to protect the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> amidst the troubles of the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. Whilst he was there news reached him that <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus</a>, who had warmly accepted the dedication of his "De Controversiis", was now proposing to put its first volume on the Index. This was because he had discovered that it assigned to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> not a direct but only an indirect power over temporals. Bellarmine, whose loyalty to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> was intense, took this greatly to heart; it was, however, averted by the death of <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus</a>, and the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/07004a.htm">Gregory XIV</a>, even granted to Bellarmine's work the distinction of a special <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>. Gaetano's mission now terminating, Bellarmine resumed his work as Spiritual Father, and had the consolation of guiding the last years of <a href="../cathen/01331c.htm">St. Aloysius Gonzaga</a>, who died in the Roman College in 1591. Many years later he had the further consolation of successfully promoting the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> of the saintly youth. Likewise at this time he sat on the final commission for the revision of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> text. This revision had been desired by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, and subsequent <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> had laboured over the task and had almost brought it to completion. But <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>, though unskilled in this branch of criticism, had introduced alterations of his own, all for the worse. He had even gone so far as to have an impression of this vitiated edition printed and partially distributed, together with the proposed <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> enforcing its use. He died, however, before the actual <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a>, and his immediate successors at once proceeded to remove the blunders and call in the defective impression. The difficulty was how to substitute a more correct edition without affixing a stigma to the name of <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus</a>, and Bellarmine proposed that the new edition should continue in the name of <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus</a>, with a prefatory explanation that, on account of <em>aliqua vitia vel typographorum vel aliorum</em> which had crept in, <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus</a> had himself resolved that a new impression should be undertaken. The suggestion was accepted, and Bellarmine himself wrote the preface, still prefixed to the Clementine edition ever since in use. On the other hand, he has been accused of untruthfulness in stating that <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus</a> had resolved on a new impression. But his testimony, as there is no evidence to the contrary, should be accepted as decisive, seeing how conscientious a man he was in the estimation of his contemporaries; and the more so since it cannot be impugned without casting a slur on the character of his fellow-commissioners who accepted his suggestion, and of <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> who with full <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the facts gave his sanction to Bellarmine's preface being prefixed to the new edition. Besides, <a href="../cathen/13100b.htm">Angelo Rocca</a>, the Secretary of the revisory commissions of <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> and the succeeding pontiffs, himself wrote a draft preface for the new edition in which he makes the same statement: (<a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus</a>) "dum errores ex typographi&acirc; ortos, et mutationes omnes, atque varias hominum opiniones recognoscere c&oelig;pit, ut postea de toto negotio deliberare atque Vulgatam editionem, prout debebat, publicare posset, morte pr&aelig;ventus quod c&oelig;perat perficere non potuit". This draft preface, to which Bellarmine's was preferred, is still extant, attached to the copy of the Sixtine edition in which the Clementine corrections are marked, and may be seen in the Biblioteca Angelica at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>In 1592 Bellarmine was made Rector of the Roman College, and in 1595 Provincial of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. In 1597 <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> recalled him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and made him his own <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and likewise Examiner of Bishops and Consultor of the Holy Office. Further, in 1599 he made him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of the title of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> <em>in vi&acirc;</em>, alleging as his reason for this promotion that "the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> had not his equal in learning". He was now appointed, along with the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Cardinal d'Ascoli, an assessor to Cardinal Madruzzi, the President of the Congregation <em>de Auxiliis</em>, which had been instituted shortly before to settle the controversy which had recently arisen between the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10437a.htm">Molinists</a> concerning the nature of the concord between efficacious grace and human liberty. Bellarmine's advice was from the first that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> question should not be decided authoritatively, but left over for further discussion in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, the disputants on either side being strictly forbidden to indulge in censures or condemnations of their adversaries. <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> at first inclined to this view, but afterwards changed completely and determined on a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> definition. Bellarmine's presence then became embarrassing, and he appointed him to the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a> just then vacant. This is sometimes spoken of as the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> disgrace, but Clement <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him with his own hands--an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> usually accord as a mark of special regard. The new <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> departed at once for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and during the next three years set a bright example of pastoral <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in its administration.



<p>In 1605 <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> died, and was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/09166a.htm">Leo XI</a> who reigned only twenty-six days, and then by <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>. In both <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclaves</a>, especially that latter, the name of Bellarmine was much before the electors, greatly to his own distress, but his quality as a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> stood against him in the judgment of many of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> insisted on keeping him at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, obediently complying, demanded that at least he should be released from an episcopal charge the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of which he could no longer fulfil. He was now made a member of the Holy Office and of other congregations, and thenceforth was the chief advisor of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> department of its administration. Of the particular transactions with which his name is most generally associated the following were the most important: The inquiry <em>de Auxiliis</em>, which after all Clement had not seen his way to decide, was now terminated with a settlement on the lines of Bellarmine's original suggestion. 1606 marked the beginning of the quarrel between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Republic of Venice</a> which, without even consulting the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, had presumed to abrogate the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> exemption from <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil jurisdiction</a> and to withdraw the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> right to hold real <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. The quarrel led to a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of pamphlets in which the part of the Republic was sustained by John Marsiglio and an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> named <a href="../cathen/13477b.htm">Paolo Sarpi</a>, and that of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> by Bellarmine and <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>. Contemporaneous with the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> episode was that of the English Oath of Alliance. In 1606, in addition to the grave disabilities which already weighed them down, the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were required under pain of <em>pr&oelig;munire</em> to take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance craftily worded in such wise that a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in refusing to take it might appear to be disavowing an undoubted civil <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, whilst if he should take it he would be not merely rejecting but even condemning as "impious and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>" the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the deposing power, that is to say, of a power, which, whether rightly or wrongly, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> had claimed and exercised for centuries with the full approval of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, and which even in that age the mass of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> defended. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> having forbidden <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to take this <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, King James himself came forward as its defender, in a book entitled "Tripoli nodo triplex cuneus", to which Bellarmine replied in his "Responsio Matthfi Torti". Other treatises followed on either side, and the result of one, written in denial of the deposing power by <a href="../cathen/02291c.htm">William Barclay</a>, an English jurist resident in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, was that Bellarmine's reply to it was branded by the Regalist <em>Parlement</em> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Thus it came to pass that, for following the <em>via media</em> of the indirect power, he was condemned in 1590 as too much of a Regalist and in 1605 as too much of a Papalist.

<p>Bellarmine did not live to deal with the later and more serious stage of the <a href="../cathen/06342b.htm">Galileo</a> case, but in 1615 he took part in its earlier stage. He had always shown great interest in the discoveries of that investigator, and was on terms of friendly correspondence with him. He took up too--as is witnessed by his letter to <a href="../cathen/06342b.htm">Galileo's</a> friend Foscarini--exactly the right attitude towards scientific theories in seeming contradiction with Scripture. If, as was undoubtedly the case then with <a href="../cathen/06342b.htm">Galileo's</a> heliocentric theory, a scientific theory is insufficiently <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, it should be advanced only as an hypothesis; but if, as is the case with this theory now, it is solidly demonstrated, care must be taken to interpret Scripture only in accordance with it. When the Holy Office condemned the heliocentric theory, by an excess in the opposite direction, it became Bellarmine's official <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to signify the condemnation to <a href="../cathen/06342b.htm">Galileo</a>, and receive his submission. Bellarmine lived to see one more <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a>, that which elected <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a> (February, 1621). His health was now failing, and in the summer of the same year he was permitted to retire to Sant' Andrea and prepare for the end. His death was most edifying and was a fitting termination to a life which had been no less remarkable for its virtues than for its achievements.

<p>His spirit of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, his singular delicacy of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and freedom from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, his spirit of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and poverty, together with the disinterestedness which he displayed as much under the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> robes as under the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit's</a> gown, his lavish charity to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and his devotedness to work, had combined to impress those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him intimately with the feeling that he was of the number of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Accordingly, when he died there was a general expectation that his cause would be promptly introduced. And so it was, under <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> in 1627, when he became entitled to the appellation of Venerable. But a technical obstacle, arising out of <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII's</a> own general legislation in regard to beatifications, required its prorogation at that time. Though it was reintroduced on several occasions (1675, 1714, 1752, and 1832), and though on each occasion the great preponderance of votes was in favour of the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a>, a successful issue came only after many years. This was partly because of the influential character of some of those who recorded adverse votes, Barbarigo, Casante, and Azzolino in 1675, and <a href="../cathen/11521c.htm">Passionei</a> in 1752, but still more for reasons of political expediency, Bellarmine's name being closely associated with a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority most obnoxious to the Regalist politicians of the French Court. "We have said", wrote <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> to <a href="../cathen/14505a.htm">Cardinal de Tencin</a>, "in confidence to the General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> that the delay of the Cause has come not from the petty matters laid to his charge by <a href="../cathen/11521c.htm">Cardinal Passionei</a>, but from the sad circumstances of the times" (&Eacute;tudes Religieuses, 15 April, 1896).

<p>[<em>Note:</em> St. Robert Bellarmine was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Pope Pius XI in 1930, and declared a <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctor of the Universal Church</a> in 1931. He is the <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of catechists.]

Cardinalis, vita quam ipse scripsit</em> (with an Appendix), written in 1613, at the request of Fathers Eudfmon Joannis and Mutius Vitelleschi, first published among the <em>acta</em> of the Process of Beatification 1675; republished in 1887 by D&Ouml;LLINGER AND REUSCH, with notes many of which are useful but the general tone of which is unfair and spiteful; a multitude of unpublished documents in the archives of the Vatican, Simancas, Salamanca, the Society of Jesus, etc.; <em>Epistol&oelig; familiares</em> (1650); EUDAEMON JOANNIS, <em>De pio obitu Card. Bellarmini</em> (1621); FINALI, <em>Esame fatto per me</em>, that is, by the lay brother who attended him in his last sickness, MS.; lives by FULIGATI (1624; translated into Latin with additions by PETRA SANCTA, 1626) and BARTOLI, (1678); CERVINI, <em>Imago virtutum</em> (1625). These form the chief original material. Of derived lives the best are those by FRIZON (1708), and COUDERC (1893). See also LE BACHELET IN VACANT, <em>Dict. de thiol. cath.</em>; and for Bellarmine's doctrine on papal authority, DE LA SERVI&Egrave;RE, <em>De Jacobo Angl. Rege cum Card. R. Bellarmine . . . disputante</em> (1900).</p></div>
