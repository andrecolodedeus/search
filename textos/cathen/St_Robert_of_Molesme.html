<h1>St. Robert of Molesme</h1>  

<p>Born about the year 1029, at Champagne, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, of noble <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> who bore the names of Thierry and Ermengarde; d. at <a href="../cathen/10433b.htm">Molesme</a>, 17 April, 1111. When fifteen years of age, he commenced his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in the Abbey of Montier-la-Celle, or St. Pierre-la-Celle, situated near <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, of which he became later prior. In 1068 he succeeded Hunaut II as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Michael de Tonnerre, in the <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Diocese of Langres</a>. About this time a band of seven <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a> who lived in the forest of Collan, in the same diocese, sought to have Robert for their chief, but the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, despite their constant resistance to his authority, insisted on keeping their <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> who enjoyed so great a reputation, and was the ornament of their house. Their intrigues determined Robert to resign his charge in 1071, and seek refuge in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Montier-la-Celle. The same year he was placed over the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of St. Ayoul de Provins, which depended on Montier-la-Celle. Meantime two of the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> of Collan went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and besought <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> to give them the <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Provins for their superior. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> granted their request, and in 1074 Robert initiated the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> of Collan in the monastic life. As the location at Collan was found unsuitable, Robert founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/10433b.htm">Molesme</a> in the valley of <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a> at the close of 1075. To Molesme as a guest came the distinguished canon and doctor (<em>&eacute;col&acirc;tre</em>) of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, Bruno, who, in 1082, placed himself under the direction of Robert, before founding the celebrated order of the Chartreux. At this time the primitive discipline was still in its full vigour, and the religious lived by the labour of their hands. Soon, however, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> became wealthy through a number of donations, and with wealth, despite the vigilance of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, came laxity of discipline. Robert endeavoured to restore the primitive strictness, but the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> showed so much resistance that he abdicated, and left the care of his community to his prior, Alberic, who retired in 1093. In the following year he returned with Robert to Molesme. On 29 Nov., 1095, <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> confirmed the institute of Molesme. In 1098 Robert, still unable to reform his rebellious <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, obtained from Hugues, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> and Legate of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, authority to found a new order on new lines. Twenty-one religious left Molesme and set out joyfully for a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> called <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> in the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a>, and the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> was founded 21 March, 1098.

<p>Left to themselves, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Molesme appealed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and Robert was restored to Molesme, which thereafter became an ardent centre of monastic life. Robert died 17 April, 1111, and was buried with great pomp in the church of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. Pope <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> by Letters Apostolic in 1222 authorized his veneration in the church of Molesme, and soon after the veneration of St. Robert was extended to the whole Church by a pontifical <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a>. The feast was fixed at first on 17 April, but later it was transferred to 29 April. The Abbey of Molesme existed up to the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. The remains of the holy founder are preserved in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church.
