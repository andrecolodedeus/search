<h1>St. Roch</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a> towards 1295; died 1327. His father was governor of that city. At his birth St. Roch is said to have been found <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> marked on the breast with a red cross. Deprived of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> when about twenty years old, he distributed his fortune among the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, handed over to his uncle the government of <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a>, and in the disguise of a <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant</a> pilgrim, set out for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, but stopped at <a href="../cathen/01109a.htm">Aquapendente</a>, which was stricken by the plague, and devoted himself to the plague-stricken, curing them with the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>. He next visited Cesena and other neighbouring cities and then <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Everywhere the terrible scourge disappeared before his <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">miraculous power</a>. He visited Mantua, <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>, <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, and other cities with the same results. At <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, he himself was stricken with the plague. He withdrew to a hut in the neighbouring forest, where his wants were supplied by a gentleman named Gothard, who by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> learned the place of his retreat. After his recovery Roch returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Arriving at <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a> and refusing to disclose his identity, he was taken for a spy in the disguise of a pilgrim, and cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> by order of the governor, &#151; his own uncle, some writers say, &#151; where five years later he died. The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> cross on his breast as well as a document found in his possession now served for his identification. He was accordingly given a public funeral, and numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> attested his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>.

<p>In 1414, during the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>, the plague having broken out in that city, the Fathers of the Council ordered public <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and processions in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, and immediately the plague ceased. His <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Wadding</a>, were carried furtively to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> in 1485, where they are still <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>. It is commonly held that he belonged to the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis; but it cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Wadding</a> leaves it an open question. <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> approved the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office to be recited on his feast (16 August). <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> instituted a confraternity, under the invocation of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, to have charge of the church and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> erected during the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>. The confraternity increased so rapidly that <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> raised it to an archconfraternity, with powers to aggregate similar confraternities of St. Roch. It was given a <a href="../cathen/03341a.htm">cardinal-protector</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> of high rank was to be its immediate superior (see Reg. et Const. Societatis S. Rochi). Various favours have been bestowed on it by <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> (C. Regimini, 7 March, 1561), by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> (C. <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 5 January, 1577), by <a href="../cathen/07004a.htm">Gregory XIV</a> (C. Paternar. pont., 7 March, 1591), and by other pontiffs. It still flourishes.
