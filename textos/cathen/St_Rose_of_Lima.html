<h1>St. Rose of Lima</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">Virgin</a>, <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patroness</a> of America, born at <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a>, <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> 20 April, 1586; died there 30 August, 1617.

<p>At her <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">confirmation</a> in 1597, she took the <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">name</a> of Rose, because, when an infant, her face had been seen transformed by a <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystical</a> rose. As a child she was remarkable for a great reverence, and pronounced <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, for all things relating to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This so took possession of her that thenceforth her life was given up to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>. She had an intense devotion to the Infant <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">His Blessed Mother</a>, before whose <a href="../cathen/01355b.htm">altar</a> she spent hours. She was scrupulously <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> and of untiring industry, making rapid progress by earnest attention to her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents'</a> instruction, to her studies, and to her domestic work, especially with her needle.

<p>After reading of <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">St. Catherine</a> she determined to take that <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> as her model. She began by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> three times a week, adding secret severe <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penances</a>, and when her vanity was assailed, cutting off her beautiful hair, wearing coarse clothing, and roughening her hands with toil. All this <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> she had to struggle against the objections of her friends, the ridicule of her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and the censure of her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. Many hours were spent before the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, which she <a href="../cathen/06278a.htm">received daily</a>.

<p>Finally she determined to take a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and inspired by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">supernatural love</a>, adopted extraordinary means to fulfill it. At the outset she had to combat the opposition of her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, who wished her to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marry</a>. For ten years the struggle continued before she won, by patience and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, their <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> to continue her mission.

<p>At the same time great <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> assailed her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">purity</a>, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and constance, causing her excruciating agony of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> and desolation of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>, urging her to more frequent <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortifications</a>; but daily, also, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> manifested Himself, fortifying her with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of His <a href="../cathen/12396a.htm">presence</a> and consoling her <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> with evidence of His Divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">Fasting</a> daily was soon followed by perpetual <a href="../cathen/01067a.htm">abstinence</a> from meat, and that, in turn, by use of only the coarsest food and just sufficient to support <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>.

<p>Her days were filled with acts of charity and industry, her exquisite <a href="../cathen/08729b.htm">lace</a> and <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a> helping to support her home, while her nights were devoted to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>. When her work permitted, she retired to a little grotto which she had built, with her brother's aid, in their small garden, and there passed her nights in solitude and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Overcoming the opposition of her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and with the <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> of her confessor, she was allowed later to become practically a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluse</a> in this cell, save for her visits to the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>.

<p>In her twentieth year she received the habit of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">St. Dominic</a>. Thereafter she redoubled the severity and variety of her <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penances</a> to a <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">heroic</a> degree, wearing constantly a metal spiked crown, concealed by roses, and an iron chain about her waist. Days passed without food, save a draught of gall mixed with bitter herbs. When she could no longer stand, she sought repose on a bed constructed by herself, of broken glass, stone, potsherds, and thorns. She admitted that the thought of lying down on it made her tremble with dread. Fourteen years this <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of her body continued without relaxation, but not without consolation. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">revealed</a> Himself to her frequently, flooding her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with such inexpressible peace and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> as to leave her in <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> for hours. At these times she offered to Him all her <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortifications</a> and <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penances</a> in expiation for offences against His Divine Majesty, for the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">her country</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinners</a>, and for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>.

<p>Many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> followed her death. She was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/04028a.htm">Clement IX</a>, in 1667, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1671 by <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a>, the first <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">American</a> to be so <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a>. Her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated 30 August. She is represented wearing a crown of roses.
