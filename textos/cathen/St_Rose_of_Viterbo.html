<h1>St. Rose of Viterbo</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">Virgin</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, 1235; died 6 March, 1252. The <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> of her life must always remain uncertain, as the Acts of her <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>, the chief historical sources, record no <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dates</a>. Those given above are accepted by the best authorities.

<p>Born of <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, Rose was remarkable for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and for her <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">miraculous powers</a> from her earliest years. When but three years old, she raised to life her maternal aunt. At the age of seven, she had already lived the life of a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluse</a>, devoting herself to <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penances</a>. Her health succumbed, but she was <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> cured by the Blessed Virgin, who ordered her to enroll herself in the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis, and to preach penance to <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, at that time (1247) held by <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and a prey to political strife and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Her mission seems to have extended for about two years, and such was her success that the prefect of the city decided to banish her. The imperial power was seriously threatened. Accordingly, Rose and her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were expelled from <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> in January, 1250, and took refuge in Sorriano. On 5 December, 1250, Rose foretold the speedy death of the emperor, a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> realized on 13 December. Soon afterwards she went to Vitorchiano, whose inhabitants had been perverted by a famous sorceress. Rose secured the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of all, even of the sorceress, by standing unscathed for three hours in the flames of a burning pyre, a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> as striking as it is well attested. With the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> power in <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> (1251) Rose returned.

<p>She wished to enter the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Mary of the Roses, but was refused because of her poverty. She humbly submitted, foretelling her admission to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> after her death. The remainder of her life was spent in the cell in her father's house, where she died. The process of her <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> was opened in that year by <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, but was not definitively undertaken until 1457. Her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 4 September, when her body, still incorrupt, is carried in <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> through <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>.
