<h1>St. Rupert</h1>  

<p>(Alternative forms, Ruprecht, Hrodperht, Hrodpreht, Roudbertus, Rudbertus, Robert, Ruprecht).

<p>First <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, contemporary of Childebert III, king of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> (695-711), <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; d. at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a>, 27 March, 718. According to an old tradition, he was a scion of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Merovingian <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. The assumption of 660 as the year of his birth is merely legendary. According to the oldest short biographical notices in the "Mon. Germ. Script.", XI, 1-15, Rupert was noted for simplicity, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and the fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; he was a lover of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in his discourse, upright in opinion, cautious in counsel, energetic in action, far-seeing in his charity, and in all his conduct a glorious model of rectitude. While he was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Worms, the fame of his learning and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> drew many from far and wide. The report of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> ability reached Duke Theodo II of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, who had placed himself at the head of the current <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> movement in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. Theodo sent Rupert messengers with the request that, he should come to <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> to revive, confirm, and propagate the spirit of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> there. Despite the work of early missionaries, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> was only superficially <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; its very <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was indeed to some extent <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>, while <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> customs and views were most closely interwoven with the external <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> which it had retained. St. Rupert acceded to Theodo's request, after he had by messengers made himself familiar with the land and people of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. St. Rupert was received with great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> by Theodo in the old residential town of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> (696). He entered immediately upon his apostolic labours, which extended from the territory of the Danube to the borders of Lower Pannonia, and upon his missionary journey came to Lorch. Thence he travelled to the lonely shores of the Wallersee, where he built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Saint Peter, thereby laying the foundation of the present market-town of Seekirchen in the Newmarket district of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>. From the Roman colony there Rupert obtained an account of the ancient Roman town of Juvavum, upon the site of which there still remained many more or less dilapidated buildings, overgrown with briars and brushwood.

<p>Having personally verified the accuracy of this account concerning the place and position, Rupert requested Theodo, in the interests of his apostolic mission to the country, to give him the territory of Juvavum (which was still a place of considerable commerce) for the erection of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. The duke granted this petition, bequeathing the territory of Juvavum (the modern <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>), two square miles in area, to St. Rupert and his successors. At the foot of the precipice of the Monchberg, where once St. Maximus, a disciple of St. Severin, had suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> with his companions (476), St. Rupert erected the first church in <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, the Church of St. Peter, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Prince of the Apostles, as well as a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Upon the lofty prominences (Nonnberg) to the southeast of the town, where the old Roman fortress once towered, he established a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> which, like the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the M&ouml;nchberg, he placed under the protection and <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>. To set his institutions upon a solid basis, Rupert repaired home, and returned with twelve companions besides his niece Ehrentraud (Erindruda), whom he made <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> over the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Convent of Nonnberg, while he with his twelve companions formed the first congregation of the famous <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Monastery of St. Peter at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, which remains to the present day. St. Rupert thenceforth devoted himself entirely to the work of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and conversion which he had already begun, founding in connection therewith many churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> &mdash; e.g., Maxglan, near <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, Maximilianszelle (now Bischofshofen in Pongau), Altotting, and others. After a life of extraordinarily successful activity, he died at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, aided by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of his brethren in the order; his body reposed in the St. Peterskirche until 24 Sept., 774, when his disciple and successor, Abbot-Bishop St. Virgil, had a portion of his remains removed to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. On 24 Sept., 1628, these <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> by Archbishop <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> von Ladron (1619-54) under the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Since then the town and district of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> solemnize the feast of St. Rupert, Apostle of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and Carlnthia, on 24 September.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> St. Rupert is portrayed with a vessel of salt in his hand, symbolizing the universal tradition according to which Rupert inaugurated salt-mining at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>; this portrayal of St. Rupert is generally found upon the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> and Carinthia. St. Rupert is also represented <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> Duke Theodo; this scene has no historical foundation. St. Rupert was the first Abbot-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, for, as he established his foundations after the manner of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, he combined in his own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> the dignities of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. A similar combination of dignities existed also in <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> and Freising. This twofold character of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> continued in <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> for nearly 300 years until the separation of the dignities was effected in 987 by Archbishop Friedrich I of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, Count of Chiemgau, the twenty-first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the Monastery of St. Peter. The period of St. Rupert's activity was until very lately a matter of great discussion. Formerly the opinion was held that the end of the fifth and beginning of the sixth centuries was the age of his missionary work, but, according to the most exhaustive and reliable investigations, the late seventh and early eighth centuries formed the period of his activity. This fact is established especially by the "Breves notitiae Salzburgenses", a catalogue of the donations made to the <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Church of Salzburg</a>, with notices from the ninth century. In these latter Bishop St. Virgil, whose ministry is referred to 745-84, appears as a direct disciple of St. Rupert. It is forthwith evident that the assumption of the end of the sixth and beginning of the seventh centuries as the period of Rupert's activity is extremely <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, even apart from the fact that this view also involves the rejection of the catalogue of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> and of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a> as the day of Rupert's death. Many churches and places bearing Rupert's name, serve as surviving memorials of his missionary activity. A successor of St. Rupert, the present scholarly <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Peters in <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, Willibald Hauthaler, has written an interesting work upon this subject entitled "Die dem hl. Rupertus Apostel von Bayern geweihten Kirchen und Kapellen" (with map, Salzburg, 1885).
