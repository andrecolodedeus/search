<h1>St. Samson</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> and confessor, born in South <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>; died 28 July, 565 (?). The date of his birth is unknown. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> whose names are given as Amon of Dyfed and Anna of Gwynedd, were of noble, but not royal, birth. While still an infant he was dedicated to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and entrusted to the care of <a href="../cathen/07661a.htm">St. Illtyd</a>, by whom he was brought up in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Llantwit Major. He showed exceptional talents in his studies, and was eventually <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by <a href="../cathen/05179a.htm">St. Dubric</a>. After this he retired to another <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, possibly after that on Caldy Island, to practise greater austerities, and some years later became it <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. About this time some <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who were returning from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> happened to visit Samson's <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. So struck was the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> by their learning and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> that he accompanied them to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and there remained some time. During h is visit he received the submission of an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and, on his return to <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, sent one of his uncles to act as its superior. His fame as a worker of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> now attracted so much attention that he resolved to found a new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> or cell "far from the haunts of men", and accordingly retired with a few companions to a lonely spot on the banks of the Severn. He was soon discovered, however, and forced by his fellow-countrymen to become <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> formerly ruled by <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a>; here <a href="../cathen/05179a.htm">St. Dubric</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> but without appointment to any particular see. Now, being warned by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, he determined to leave <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and, after some delay, set sail for Brittany. He landed near Dol, and there built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which became the centre of his episcopal work in the district. Business taking him to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, he visited King Childebert there, and was nominated by him as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dol; Dol, however, did not become a regular <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> till about the middle of the ninth century. Samson attained the age of 85 years, and was buried at Dol. Several early lives of Samson exist. The oldest, printed by <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> in his "Acta Sanctorum" from a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> at <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, and again by the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>, claims to be compiled from information derived from Samson's contemporaries, which would refer it to about 600. Dom Plaine in the "Analecta Bollandiana" has edited another and fuller life (from <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> Andeg., 719), which he regards as earlier than <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon's</a>. Later lives are numerous.
