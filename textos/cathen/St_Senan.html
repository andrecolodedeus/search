<h1>St. Senan</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> and confessor, b. at Magh Lacha, Kilrush, Co. Clare, c. 488; d. 1 March, 560, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> being Erean and Comgella. His birth was prophetically announced by <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> on his visit to the Hy Fidhgent (Co. Limerick), and as a boy he was placed under the guidance of a saintly <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> called Cassidan, finishing his studies under St. Naul) at Kilmanagh, Co. Kilkenny. He commenced his missionary career by founding a church near Enniscorthy, in 510 (or 512), and the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> is still known as Templeshannon (<em>Teampul Senain</em>). He then visited Menevia, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and Tours, and returned to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in 520. Having founded churches at Inniscarra (Co. <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>), at Inisluinghe, at <a href="../cathen/04674b.htm">Deer</a> Island, Inismore, and Mutton Island, he finally settled at Iniscathay, or Scattery Island, Co. Clare. He was visited by St. Ciaran and <a href="../cathen/02758c.htm">St. Brendan</a>, and other holy men, who had heard of his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Scattery Island became not only a famous <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> but the seat of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> with St. Senan as its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. This event may be dated as about the year 535 or 540, and St. Senan's <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> extended over the existing Baronies of Moyarta and Clonderalaw in Thomond, the Barony of Connelo in <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, and a small portion of <a href="../cathen/08627a.htm">Kerry</a> from the Feal to the Atlantic. The legend of "St. Senanus and the Lady", as told in <a href="../cathen/10553b.htm">Tom Moore's</a> lyric, is founded on the fact that no <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was allowed to enter Scattery Island; not even St. Cannera was permitted to land there, yet St. Senan founded two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> for <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and was actually on a visit to one of them when he died. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church of Iniscathay on 8 March, on which day his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is observed. The Diocese of Inniscathy continued till the year 1189, when it was suppressed. It was, however, restored by Pope <a href="../cathen/08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a>, and continued as a separate see under Bishop Thomas (1358-68). In 1378 its possessions were divided, and the island remained a portion of <a href="../cathen/08641a.htm">Killaloe</a>, being subsequently merged into the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Kilrush. One of the earliest references to the Round Tower of Inniscathay is in the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> life of St. Senan.
