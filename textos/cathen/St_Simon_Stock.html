<h1>St. Simon Stock</h1>  

<p>Born in the County of Kent, <a href="../cathen/05431b.htm">England</a>, about 1165; died in the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux, France</a>, 16 May, 1265. On account of his <a href="../cathen/05431b.htm">English</a> birth he is also called Simon Anglus.

<p>It is said that when twelve years old he began to live as a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> in the hollow trunk of an oak, and later to have become an itinerant preacher until he entered the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite Order</a> which had just come to <a href="../cathen/05431b.htm">England</a>. According to the same tradition he went as a <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and from there to <a href="../cathen/03352a.htm">Mt. Carmel</a>, where he spent several years. All that is historically certain is that in 1247 he was elected the sixth general of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, as successor to Alan, at the first <a href="../cathen/06412b.htm">chapter</a> held at Aylesford, <a href="../cathen/05431b.htm">England</a>. Notwithstanding his great age he showed remarkable energy as general and did much for the benefit of the order, so that he is justly regarded as the most celebrated of its generals. During his occupancy of the office the order became widely spread in southern and western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, especially in <a href="../cathen/05431b.htm">England</a>; above all, he was able to found houses in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> cities of that era, as in 1248 at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>, in 1253 at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, in 1260 at <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">Paris</a> and <a href="../cathen/02641b.htm">Bologna</a>. This action was of the greatest importance both for the growth of the institution and for the training of its younger members. Simon was also able to gain at least the temporary <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> for the altered rule of the order which had been adapted to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> conditions. Nevertheless the order was greatly oppressed, and it was still struggling everywhere to secure admission, either to obtain the consent of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, or the toleration of other orders. In these difficulties, as Guilelmus de Sanvico (shortly after 1291) relates, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to their <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patroness</a> the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>. "And the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a> revealed to their prior that they were to apply fearlessly to <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Pope Innocent</a>, for they would receive from him an effective remedy for these difficulties". The <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> followed the counsel of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a>, and the order received a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> or <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">letter</a> of protection from <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> against these molestations. It is an historical fact that <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> issued this <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">papal letter</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> under date of 13 January, 1252, at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>.

<p>Later <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> writers give more details of such a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> and <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">revelation</a>. Johannes Grossi wrote his "Viridarium" about 1430, and he relates that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> appeared to Simon Stock with the <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> of the order in her hand. This <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> she gave him with the words: "Hoc erit tibi et cunctis Carmelitis privilegium, in hoc habitu moriens salvabitur" (This shall be the <a href="../cathen/13289b.htm">privilege</a> for you and for all the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, that anyone dying in this habit shall be saved). On account of this great <a href="../cathen/13289b.htm">privilege</a> many distinguished <a href="../cathen/05431b.htm">Englishmen</a>, such as King Edward II, Henry, Duke of Lancaster, and many others of the nobility secretly wore (<em>clam portaverunt</em>) the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> under their clothing and died with it on. In Grossi's narrative, however, the <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> of the order must be taken to mean the habit of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> and not as the small <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a>. As was the custom in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a> among the other orders, the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> gave their habit or at least their <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> to their benefactors and friends of high rank, that these might have a share in the <a href="../cathen/13289b.htm">privilege</a> apparently connected with their habit or <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>. It is possible that the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> themselves at that period wore their <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> at night in a smaller form just as they did at a later date and at the present time: namely, in about the form of the <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> for the present <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">third order</a>. If this is so they could give <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> their <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> in this form. At a later date, probably not until the sixteenth century, instead of the <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> of the order the small <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> was given as a token of the <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> brotherhood. Today the brotherhood regards this as its chief <a href="../cathen/13289b.htm">privilege</a>, and one it owes to St. Simon Stock, that anyone who dies wearing the <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> is not eternally lost. In this way the chief <a href="../cathen/13289b.htm">privilege</a> and entire history of the little <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> is connected with the name of St. Simon Stock. There is no difficulty in granting that Grossi's narrative, related above, and the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> tradition are worthy of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, even though they have not the full value of historical proof (see <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">SCAPULAR</a>). That Simon himself was distinguished by special veneration of and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a> is shown by the <a href="../cathen/01576b.htm">antiphonies</a> "Flos Carmeli" and "Ave Stella Matutina", which he wrote, and which have been adopted in the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">breviary</a> of the Calced Carmelites. Besides these <a href="../cathen/01576b.htm">antiphonies</a> other works have been incorrectly attributed to him. The first biographical accounts of Simon belong to the year 1430, but these are not entirely reliable. However, he was not at this time publicly venerated as a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>; it was not until 1435 that his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> was put in the choral books of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>. It was introduced before 1458 into <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and, probably at the same time, into <a href="../cathen/05431b.htm">England</a>; by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06412b.htm">General Chapter</a> of 1564 its celebration was commanded for the entire order.
