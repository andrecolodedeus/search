<h1>St. Stanislaus of Cracow</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, born at Szczepan&oacute;w (hence called Szczepanowski), in the Diocese of Cracow, 26 July, 1030; died at <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, 8 May, 1079; feast on May 7 in Roman Martyrology, but on 8 May in <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, which has a special feast of the translation of his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> on 27 September; patron of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> and the city and Diocese of Cracow; invoked in battle. In pictures he is given the episcopal insignia and the sword. Larger <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> represent him in a court or kneeling before the altar and receiving the fatal blow. No contemporary biography of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> is in existence. At the time of his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> a life appeared written by a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Vincent(?) (Acta SS., May, II, 196) which contains much legendary matter. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, Belislaus and Bogna, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and noble <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, gave him a religious <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. He made his studies at <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>(?). After the death of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> he distributed his ample inheritance among the poor. Lambert Zula, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> him <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and made him <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Czembocz near <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, canon and preacher at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and later, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. After the death of Lambert he was elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but accepted only on explicit command of <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Pope Alexander II</a>. He worked with his wonted energy for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and inveighed against vices among high and low, regardless of consequences. Boleslaw II had become King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. the renown he had gained by his successful <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> he now sullied by atrocious cruelty and unbridled <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Moreover the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had several serious disputes with the king about a piece of land belonging to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which was <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> claimed by Boleslaw, and about some nobles, who had left their homes to ward off various evils threatening their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> and who were in consequence cruelly treated by the king. Stanislaus spared neither tears nor <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and admonitions to bring the king to lead a more <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life. All being in vain, Boleslaw was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and the canons of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> were instructed to discontinue the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Offices</a> in case the king should attempt to enter. Stanislaus retired to the Chapel of St. Michael in a suburb of Cracow. The king was furious and followed the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> with his guards, some of whom he sent to kill the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. These dared not obey, so Boleslaw slew him during the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>. The body was at first buried in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, but in 1088 it was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> by Bishop Lambert II. St. Stanislaus was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> 1253 by <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>.
