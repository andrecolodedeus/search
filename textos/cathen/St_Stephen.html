<h1>St. Stephen</h1>  

<p>One of the first <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>; feast on 26 December. In the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> the name of St. Stephen occurs for the first time on the occasion of the appointment of the first <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> (<a href="../bible/act006.htm#vrs5">Acts 6:5</a>). Dissatisfaction concerning the distribution of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> from the community's fund having arisen in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, seven men were selected and specially <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> to take care of the temporal relief of the poorer members. Of these seven, Stephen, is the first mentioned and the best known.

<p>Stephen's life previous to this appointment remains for us almost entirely in the dark. His name is Greek and suggests he was a Hellenist, i.e., one of those <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who had been born in some foreign land and whose native tongue was Greek; however, according to a fifth century tradition, the name Stephanos was only a Greek equivalent for the Aramaic <em>Kelil</em> (Syr. <em>kelila</em>, crown), which may be the protomartyr's original name and was inscribed on a slab found in his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. It seems that Stephen was not a <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselyte</a>, for the fact that Nicolas is the only one of the seven designated as such makes it almost certain that the others were <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> by birth. That Stephen was a pupil of <a href="../cathen/06374b.htm">Gamaliel</a> is sometimes inferred from his able defence before the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a>; but this has not been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. Neither do we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> when and in what circumstances he became a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; it is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether the statement of <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> (Haer., xx, 4) numbering Stephen among the seventy disciples is deserving of any credence. His ministry as <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> appears to have been mostly among the Hellenist converts with whom the Apostles were at first less familiar; and the fact that the opposition he met with sprang up in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> of the "Libertines" (probably the children of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> taken captive to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Pompey in 63 B.C. and freed hence the name <em>Libertini</em>), and "of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of them that were of Cilicia and <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>" shows that he usually preached among the Hellenist <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. That he was pre eminently fitted for that work, his abilities and character, which the author of the Acts dwells upon so fervently, are the best indication. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had, by selecting him for a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, publicly acknowledged him as a man "of good reputation, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom" (<a href="../bible/act006.htm#vrs3">Acts 6:3</a>). He was "a man full of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and of the Holy Ghost" (vi, 5), "full of grace and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>" (vi, 8); his uncommon oratorical powers and unimpeachable <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> no one was able to resist, so much so that to his arguments replete with the Divine energy of the Scriptural authorities <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> added the weight of "great wonders and signs" (vi, 8). Great as was the efficacy of "the wisdom and the spirit that spoke" (vi, 10), still it could not bend the minds of the unwilling; to these the forceful preacher was fatally soon to become an enemy.

<p>The conflict broke out when the cavillers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> "of the Libertines, and of the <a href="../cathen/04591b.htm">Cyreneans</a>, and of the Alexandrians, and of them that were of Cilicia and Asia", who had challenged Stephen to a dispute, came out completely discomfited (vi, 9 10); wounded <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> so inflamed their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> that they suborned <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witnesses to testify that "they had heard him speak words of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against Moses and against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (vi, 11).

<p>No charge could be more apt to rouse the mob; the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of the ancients and the scribes had been already kindled from the first reports of the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Stephen was arrested, not without some <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> it seems (the Greek word <em>synerpasan</em> implies so much), and dragged before the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a>, where he was accused of saying that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a> shall destroy this place [the temple], and shall change the traditions which Moses delivered unto us" (vi, 12 14). No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> Stephen had by his language given some grounds for the accusation; his accusers apparently twisted into the offensive utterance attributed to him a declaration that "the most High dwelleth not in houses made by hands" (vii, 48), some mention of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> foretelling the destruction of the Temple and some inveighing against the burthensome traditions fencing about the Law, or rather the asseveration so often repeated by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> that "there is no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in any other" (cf. iv, 12) the Law not excluded but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. However this may be, the accusation left him unperturbed and "all that sat in the council...saw his face as if it had been the face of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>" (vi, 15).

<p>Stephen's answer (<a href="../bible/act007.htm">Acts 7</a>) was a long recital of the mercies of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> towards <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> during its long history and of the ungratefulness by which, throughout, <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> repaid these mercies. This discourse contained many things unpleasant to Jewish ears; but the concluding indictment for having betrayed and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> the Just One whose coming the Prophets had foretold, provoked the rage of an audience made up not of judges, but of foes. When Stephen "looking up steadfastly to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, saw the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> standing on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>", and said: "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> standing on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (vii, 55), they ran <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> upon him (vii, 56) and cast him out of the city to stone him to death. Stephen's stoning does not appear in the narrative of the Acts as a deed of mob <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>; it must have been looked upon by those who took part in it as the carrying out of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. According to law (<a href="../bible/lev024.htm#vrs14">Leviticus 24:14</a>), or at least its usual interpretation, Stephen had been taken out of the city; custom required that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to be stoned be placed on an elevation from whence with his hands bound he was to be thrown down. It was most likely while these preparations were going on that, "falling on his knees, he cried with a loud voice, saying: "Lord, lay not this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to their charge" (vii, 59). Meanwhile the witnesses, whose hands must be first on the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> condemned by their testimony (<a href="../bible/deu017.htm#vrs7">Deuteronomy 17:7</a>), were laying down their garments at the feet of Saul, that they might be more ready for the task devolved upon them (vii, 57). The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> was thrown down; and while the witnesses were thrusting upon him "a stone as much as two men could carry", he was heard to utter this supreme <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, receive my spirit" (vii, 58). Little did all the people present, casting stones upon him, realize that the blood they shed was the first seed of a harvest that was to cover the world.

<p>The bodies of men stoned to death were to be buried in a place appointed by the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a>. Whether in this instance the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a> insisted on its right cannot be affirmed; at any rate, "devout men" &#151; whether <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> or <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, we are not told &#151; "took order for Stephen's funeral, and made great mourning over him" (vii, 2). For centuries the location of St. Stephen's <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> was lost sight of, until (415) a certain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> named Lucian learned by revelation that the sacred body was in Caphar Gamala, some distance to the north of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were then exhumed and carried first to the church of Mount Sion, then, in 460, to the basilica erected by Eudocia outside the Damascus Gate, on the spot where, according to tradition, the stoning had taken place (the opinion that the scene of St. Stephen's <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> was east of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, near the Gate called since St. Stephen's Gate, is unheard of until the twelfth century). The site of the Eudocian <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> was identified some twenty years ago, and a new edifice has been erected on the old foundations by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fathers.

<p>The only first hand source of information on the life and death of St. Stephen is the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> (<a href="../bible/act006.htm#vrs1">6:1-8:2</a>).
