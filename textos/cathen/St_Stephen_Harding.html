<h1>St. Stephen Harding</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/04215a.htm">Confessor</a>, the third <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, was born at <a href="../cathen/13756c.htm">Sherborne</a> in Dorsetshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, about the middle of the eleventh century; died 28 March, 1134. He received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/13756c.htm">Sherborne</a> and afterwards studied in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On returning from the latter city he stopped at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/10433b.htm">Molesme</a> and, being much impressed by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of St. Robert, the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, joined that community. Here he practised great austerities, became one of St. Robert's chief supporters and was one of the band of twenty-one <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who, by authority of Hugh, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, retired to C&iuml;teaux to institute a reform in the new foundation there. When St. Robert was recalled to Molesme (1099), Stephen became <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of C&iuml;teaux under Alberic, the new <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. On Alberic's death (1110) Stephen, who was absent from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at the time, was elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. The number of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> was now very reduced, as no new members had come to fill the places of those who had died. Stephen, however, insisted on retaining the strict observance originally instituted and, having offended the Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&iuml;teaux's</a> great patron, by forbidding him or his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to enter the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, was even forced to beg <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> from door to door. It seemed as if the foundation were doomed to die out when (1112) <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> with thirty companions joined the community. This <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the beginning of extraordinary prosperity. The next year Stephen founded his first colony at La Fert&eacute;, and before is death he had established thirteen <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in all. His powers as an organizer were exceptional, he instituted the system of general chapters and regular visitations and, to ensure uniformity in all his foundations, drew up the famous "Charter of Charity" or collection of statutes for the government of all <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> united to C&iuml;teaux, which was approved by <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Pope Callistus II</a> in 1119 (see <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">CISTERCIANS</a>). In 1133 Stephen, being now old, infirm, and almost blind, resigned the post of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, designating as his successor Robert de Monte, who was accordingly elected by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The saint's choice, however, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> unfortunate and the new <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> only held office for two years.

<p>Stephen was buried in the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Alberic, his predecessor, in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>. In the Roman calendar his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is 17 April, but the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> themselves keep it on 15 July, with an octave, regarding him as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> founder of the order. Besides the "Carta Caritatis" he is commonly credited with the authorship of the "Exordium Cisterciencis cenobii", which however may not be his. Two of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> are preserved and also two letters (Nos. 45 and 49) in the "Epp. S. Bernardi".
