<h1>St. Stephen of Muret</h1>  

<p>Born 1045; died at Muret, 8 February, 1124, founder of the Abbey and Order of Grandmont. Serious chronological difficulties are presented by the traditional story of his early life, which runs as follows: Stephen in his twelfth year accompanied his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, the Viscount of Thiers, to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, where he was left to be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by Milo, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>; after passing twelve years in this <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate's</a> household, he became the inmate of a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in Calabria, but never received the habit. He then returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to bid farewell to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, having formed the design of entering religion, but, finding them dead, returned to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. His patron Milo having also died, he established himself at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he studied the rules of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of the city. After a four years' sojourn he obtained a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> from <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> authorizing him to found an institute resembling that of the solitaries he had frequented in Calabria, and returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He is said to have settled at Muret in 1076. This story is impossible; his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> visited <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in order to make a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/11063b.htm">St. Nicholas</a> at <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a>; but <a href="../cathen/11063b.htm">St. Nicholas's</a> <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were not placed there till some years later; Milo was not <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> for twelve years. The exact <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as to St. Stephen's life cannot now be established. He went to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and there saw some religious whose holy life inspired him with a desire to imitate them, but who they were, <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> or <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. The quarrel as to what great order could claim Grandmont as its offspring, with the consequent forgeries, has done much to involve the founder's life in obscurity. Though Stephen was certainly the founder of the Order of Grandmont, he did little for his disciples except offer them the example of his holy life, and it was not till after his death that the order was firmly established. His head is preserved in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> Church of St. Sylvestre, Canton of Lauri&egrave;re (Haute Vienne). He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1189 and his feast occurs on 8 February. His works (not authentic) may be found in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L. CCIV, 997-1162.
