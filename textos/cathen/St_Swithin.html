<h1>St. Swithin</h1>  

<p>(SWITHUN).

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>; died 2 July, 862.

<p>Very little is known of this saint's life, for his biographers constructed their "Lives" long after his death and there is hardly any mention of him in contemporary documents. Swithin was one of the two trusted counsellors of Egbert, King of the West Saxons (d. 839), helping him in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters, while Ealstan of Sherborne was his chief advisor He probably entrusted Swithin with the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of his son Ethelwulf and caused the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> to be elected to the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> in succession to Helmstan. His <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> by Ceolnoth, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, seems to have taken place on 30 October, 852. On his deathbed Swithin begged that he should be buried outside the north wall of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> where passers-by should pass over his grave and raindrops from the eaves drop upon it.

<p>More than a century later (931) his body was translated with great pomp to a shrine within the new church erected by Bishop Ethelwulf (d. 984). A number of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> cures took place and Swithin was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by popular acclamation. In 1093 his remains were again translated to the new church built by Bishop Walkelin. The shrine was destroyed and the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> scattered in 1538.

<p>It has often been said that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and even Prior of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> but there is no evidence for this statement. From the first translation of his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> in 984 till the destruction of the shrine St. Swithin was the patron of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a>. He is best known from the popular <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> attached to his name and expressed in the following rhyme: <blockquote> St. Swithin's day if thou dost rain <br>For forty days it will remain <br>St. Swithin's day if thou be fair <br>For forty days 'twill rain nae mair. </blockquote>

<p>There have been many attempts to explain the origin of this <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, but none have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> generally satisfactory. A similar <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> attaches in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to 8 June, the feast of <a href="../cathen/06537a.htm">Sts. Gervasius and Protasius</a>, and to other feasts in different countries (see <em>Notes and Queries</em>, 1885, XII, 137, 253). St. Swithin's feast is kept on 15 July, the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his first translation, and is retained in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> Calendar.
