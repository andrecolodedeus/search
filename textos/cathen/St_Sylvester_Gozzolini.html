<h1>St. Sylvester Gozzolini</h1>  

<p>Founder of the <a href="../cathen/14372c.htm">Sylvestrines</a>, b. of the noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Gozzolini at <a href="../cathen/11338a.htm">Osimo</a>, 1177; d. 26 Nov., 1267. He was sent to study <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> at Bologna and Padua, but, feeling within himself a call to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>, abandoned the study of law for that of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, giving long hours daily to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. On his return home we are told that his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, angered at his change of purpose, refused to speak to him for ten years. Sylvester now accepted a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> at <a href="../cathen/11338a.htm">Osimo</a> and devoted himself to pastoral work with such <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> as to arouse the hostility of his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, whom he had respectfully rebuked for the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a> caused by the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate's</a> irregular life. The saint was threatened with the loss of his <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a>, but decided to leave the world on seeing the decaying corpse of one who had formerly been noted for great beauty. In 1227 he retired to a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> place about thirty miles from <a href="../cathen/11338a.htm">Osimo</a> and lived there in the utmost poverty until he was recognized by the owner of the land, a certain nobleman named Conrad, who offered him a better site for his hermitage. From this spot he was driven by damp and next established himself at Grotta Fucile, where he eventually built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of his order. In this place his penances were most severe, for he lived on raw herbs and water and slept on the bare ground. Disciples flocked to him seeking his direction, and it became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to choose a rule. According to the legend the various founders appeared to him in a vision, each begging him to adopt his rule. St. Sylvester chose for his followers that of St. Benedict and built his first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on Monte Fano, where, like another St. Benedict, he had first to destroy the remains of a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> temple. In 1247 he obtained from <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, a bull confirming his order, and before his death founded a number of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. An account of his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and of the growth of his cultus will be found in Bolzonetti. His body was disinterred and placed in a shrine (1275-85) and is still <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in the church of Monte Fano. <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a> first recognized the title of blessed popularly bestowed on Sylvester, who was inscribed as a saint in the Roman Martyrology by order of <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> (1598). His office and Mass were extended to the Universal Church by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 26 November.
