<h1>St. Symphorosa</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyred</a> with her seven sons at <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tibur</a> (Tivoli) towards the end of the reign of <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Emperor Hadrian</a> (117-138). The story of their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is told in an old Passio, the reliability of which is seriously questioned by many modern hagiologists. According to this Passio, Symphorosa was a lady living at <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tibur</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of the tribune, Getulius, who had previously been <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> by <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Emperor Hadrian</a> at Gabii, now Torri, a town of the Sabines. When Hadrian had completed his costly palace at <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tibur</a> and began its dedication by offering <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, he received the following response from the gods: "The <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> Symphorosa and her sons torment us daily by invoking their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If she and her sons offer sacrifice, we promise to give you all that you ask for." When all the emperor's attempts to induce Symphorosa and her sons to sacrifice to the gods were unsuccessful, he ordered her to be brought to the Temple of Hercules, where, after various tortures, she was thrown into the river (Anio), with a heavy rock fastened to her neck. Her brother Eugenius, who was a member of the council of <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tibur</a>, buried her in the outskirts of the city. The next day the emperor summoned her seven sons, and being equally unsuccessful in his attempts to make them sacrifice to the gods, he ordered them to be tied to seven stakes which had been erected for the purpose round the Temple of Hercules. Each of them suffered a different kind of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Crescens was pierced through the throat, Julian through the breast, Nemesius through the heart, Primitivus was wounded at the navel, Justinus was pierced through the back, Stracteus (Stacteus, Estacteus) was wounded at the side, and Eugenius was cleft in two parts from top to bottom. Their bodies were thrown into a deep ditch at a place which the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> afterwards called "Ad septem Biothanatos." (The Greek word <em>biodanatos</em>, or rather <em>biaiodanatos</em>, was employed for self-murderers and, by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, applied to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>). Hereupon the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> ceased for one year and six months, (during which period the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were buried on the Via Tiburtina, eight or nine miles from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>It is difficult to ascertain how much reliability these Acts possess. The opinion that they were written by <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Julius Africanus</a> (third century) has been almost universally rejected, since neither <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> nor any other historian of that period makes the least allusion to any Acts of Roman or <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> composed by this African writer. The "Hieronymian Martyrology," which was compiled by an unknown author in the second half of the fifth century, commemorates St. Symphorosa and her sons on 18 July, but here the names of her sons are entirely different from those given in the Acts. One of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> (codex Bernensis) of this <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> states that the Acts of these <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> are extant: "quorum gesta habentur" ("Martyrologium Hieronymianum," edited by <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> and Duchesne in Acta SS. Novembris II, I, 93). Since here the names of Symphorosa's sons are different from those of the Acts which we possess, there must have existed some other "Gesta" to which the author of the <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> refers. In the same <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a>, on 27 June, are commemorated seven brother- <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, whose names are identical with those which our Acts assign to the sons of Symphorosa. It is probable that the author of the Acts, guided by the tradition that Symphorosa had seven sons who were <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a>, made her the mother of the seven <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, whom he found mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> on 27 June. If this is the case, we may infer, provided Symphorosa had seven sons at all, that their names were not those mentioned in the Acts. Whether they were those assigned to them in the "Hieronymian Martyrology" will also remain <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> as long as we have no <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> that the "Gesta" to which the author refers are authentic. Some hagiologists consider the seven sons of Symphorosa, like those of Felicitas, a mere adaptation of the seven sons of the Maccabean Mother. In the seventeenth century, Bosio discovered the ruins of a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> at the place popularly called "le sette fratte" (the seven brothers), on the Via Tiburtina, nine miles from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. (Bosio, "Roma Sotteranea," 105-9). The Acts and the "Hieronymian Martyrology" agree in designating this spot as the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Symphorosa and her sons. Further discoveries, that leave no room for <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the basilica was built over their <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, were made by Stevenson. The remains were transferred to the Church of S. Angelo is Pescaria at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/14288c.htm">Stephen (II) III</a> in 752. A sarcophagus was found here in 1610, bearing the inscription: "Hic requiescunt corpora SS. Martyrum Simforosae, viri sui Zotici (Getulii) et Filiorum ejus a Stephano Papa translata." The <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Diocese of Tivoli</a> honours them as patrons and the whole Church celebrates their feast 18 July.
