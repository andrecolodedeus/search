<h1>St. Tarasius</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; died 25 February, 806. He was the son of the Patrician and Prefect of Constantinople, George, and his wife Eukratia, and entered the service of the State. In 784 when Paul IV <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople died Tarasius was an imperial secretary, and a champion of the veneration of images. It may be that before his death the patriarch had recommended Tarasius as his successor in the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> to the Empress Irene who was regent for her son Constantine VI (780-797). After the burial of Paul IV a great popular assembly was held before the Magnaura Palace to discuss the filling of the vacant see. The empress delivered an oration on the new appointment to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> and the people proclaimed Tarasius as the most worthy candidate. The empress agreed but said that Tarasius refused to accept the position. Tarasius now made a speech himself in which he declared he felt himself unworthy of the office, further that the elevation of a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> was very hazardous, and that the position of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople had become a very difficult one, as it was separated from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and isolated from the other Oriental <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a>; consequently he would only be willing to accept the position of patriarch on condition that Church unity be restored and that, in connection with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, an oecumenical council be called. The majority of the populace approved of these views and the imperial Court agreed to it. So on 25 December, 784, Tarasius was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> patriarch. In 785 he sent the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> George as his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Hadrian I</a> with a letter in which he announced his appointment. In his reply the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> expressed his disapproval of the elevation of Tarasius directly from the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> to the dignity of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> contrary to canonical regulation, but allowed clemency to rule in view of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of the new patriarch's views, and recognized him as patriarch. After this by joint action with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the imperial Court Tarasius called the <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Second Council of Nicaea</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Seventh Ecumenical Council</a>, which rejected <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclasm</a>. Union with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> was restored.

<p>After the synod the patriarch had a number of struggles not only with the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclastic</a> party of the capital but also with a party of Orthodox <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. First, the latter upbraided him for restoring to office the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had formerly maintained <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclasm</a>, but who had submitted to the decrees of the Council of 787. As, however, this was in accordance with the decrees of the council the accusation was allowed to drop. Another accusation was much more serious, namely, that Tarasius tolerated and encouraged <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>, because those <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had given money to obtain their positions were only commanded by him to do a year's penance and were permitted to retain their offices. The patriarch defended himself in writing against this accusation which he denied in toto; moreover, he issued a severe synodal letter against <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">Simonists</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, however, were not satisfied; they maintained their accusations and also attacked the Council of 787. At a later date <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">Theodore of Studium</a>, who took part in these disputes, changed his opinion of Tarasius, and also of the <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Second Council of Nicaea</a>, the oecumenical character of which he acknowledged. Many serious difficulties still existed in regard to Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. There were also fresh disputes in Constantinople when the Emperor Constantine VI put aside his lawful wife and wished to marry Theodata, a relative of <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">Abbot Theodore of Studium</a>. Tarasius positively refused to perform the second marriage and expressed his displeasure at the conduct of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Joseph who had married the emperor. The <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, whose leaders were the Abbots Plato of Saccudium and <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">Theodore of Studium</a>, accused the patriarch of weakness, because he took no further steps against the emperor. They refused to have Church fellowship any longer with Tarasius, and were, consequently, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the emperor who, however, also treated the patriarch harshly. After Irene had dethroned Constantine in 797, Tarasius deposed the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Joseph and peace was once more restored between the patriarch and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">THEODORE OF STUDIUM</a>). In 802 Tarasius <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> as emperor Nicephorus, who had overthrown Irene, an act that greatly dissatisfied the populace. The patriarch had nothing to do with the intrigues of the court. His life was ascetic and simple, he checked the luxury of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, preached with great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and was very benevolent to the poor. After his death he was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a saint. His name is also placed in the Roman Martyrology under the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of 25 February.
