<h1>St. Teilo</h1>  

<p>(Eliud.)

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">"Archbishop"</a> of <a href="../cathen/09315c.htm">Llandaff</a>, born at Eccluis Gunniau, near Tenby, Pembrokeshire; died at Llandilo Vawr, Carmarthenshire, probably in or before 560, an old man, but Ussher puts his death at 604. Sir John Rhys thinks that his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> name was Eliau or Eilliau; in Latin it usually appears as Teliarus, in Breton as Teliau, and in French as T&eacute;lo. He was cousin to St. David and born of a good <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> settled at Penally, near Tenby. His father, whose name was probably Usyllt, may possibly be identified with St. Issell, the patron of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of Saundersfoot. His sister Anaumed, or Anauved, married King Budic of Armorica, and became the mother of St. Oudaceus, Teilo's successor. The earliest extant biographies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> are late and uncritical. Educated under St. Dyfrig or Dubric, at Hentland, Herefordshire, and under St. Paul the Old or Paulinus at Whitland, Carmarthenshire, he subsequently ruled the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/09315c.htm">Llandaff</a>, named after him Bangor Deilo. The story of his visit to Palestine with SS. David and Padarn (or Paternus) about 518, and their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> there as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> by John III, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, is not now generally credited; but it seems that about that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, when <a href="../cathen/05179a.htm">St. Dubric</a> withdrew to Bardsey, St. Teilo succeeded him at <a href="../cathen/09315c.htm">Llandaff</a>. In 547 the "yellow plague" began to ravage <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, and shortly afterwards St. Teilo with many of his flock crossed to Armorica, where they were hospitably entertained by his friend St. Sampson, Abbot and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dol. After seven years and seven months Teilo returned to <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, and is said to have been elected to the archiepiscopate vacant by the death of St. David, and to have transferred it from <a href="../cathen/10187d.htm">Menevia</a> to Llandaff; but the more general modern opinion seems to be that in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> at that epoch the episcopate was not yet <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a>.

<p>The story of the three bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, which were discovered the day after his death, was probably invited to account for the fact that the churches at <a href="../cathen/09315c.htm">Llandaff</a>, Llandilo Vawr, and Penally, all claimed to possess his body. Doubtless at his death his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were widely distributed. Today they are <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> at Landeleau (Finist&egrave;re), Plogonnac (Finist&egrave;re), and Saint T&eacute;lo (C&ocirc;tes-du-Nord). Five <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches in Brittany are dedicated to him (Landeleau, Leuhan, Montertelot, Pl&eacute;d&eacute;liac, and Saint T&eacute;lo) as well as a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> between Plogonnac and Locronan. The modern <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church at Tenby bears the names of "Holyrood and St. Teilo". The dedication of twelve churches in the present <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> Diocese of St. David's, and of six in that of <a href="../cathen/09315c.htm">Llandaff</a>, show they owe their origin to this <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. Borlase argues his connection with six dedications in Cornwall and Devon. It is stated that he was formally <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>, but no date is given. He is not infrequently represented in Breton churches as riding on a stag. His festival is, or was, kept in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> and at Saint T&eacute;lo on 9 February; at Dol, was a double, on 29 November; and in other places in Brittany on 25 November.
