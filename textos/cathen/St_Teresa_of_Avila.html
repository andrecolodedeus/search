<h1>St. Teresa of Avila</h1>  

<p>Teresa Sanchez Cepeda Davila y Ahumada

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a>, Old <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a>, 28 March, 1515; died at Alba de Tormes, 4 Oct., 1582.

<p>The third child of Don Alonso Sanchez de Cepeda by his second wife, Do&ntilde;a Beatriz Davila y Ahumada, who died when the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was in her fourteenth year, Teresa was brought up by her saintly father, a lover of serious books, and a tender and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> mother. After her death and the marriage of her eldest sister, Teresa was sent for her <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> to the Augustinian <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> at <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a>, but owing to illness she left at the end of eighteen months, and for some years remained with her father and occasionally with other relatives, notably an uncle who made her acquainted with the <a href="../fathers/3001.htm">Letters of St. Jerome</a>, which determined her to adopt the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, not so much through any attraction towards it, as through a desire of choosing the safest course. Unable to obtain her father's consent she left his house unknown to him on Nov., 1535, to enter the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Convent of the Incarnation at <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a>, which then counted 140 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. The wrench from her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> caused her a pain which she ever afterwards compared to that of death. However, her father at once yielded and Teresa took the habit.

<p>After her profession in the following year she became very seriously ill, and underwent a prolonged cure and such unskillful medical treatment that she was reduced to a most pitiful state, and even after partial recovery through the intercession of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">St. Joseph</a>, her health remained permanently impaired. During these years of suffering she began the practice of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">mental prayer</a>, but fearing that her conversations with some world-minded relatives, frequent visitors at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, rendered her unworthy of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> bestowed on her in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, discontinued it, until she came under the influence, first of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, and afterwards of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Meanwhile <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had begun to visit her with <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">"intellectual visions and locutions"</a>, that is manifestations in which the exterior senses were in no way affected, the things seen and the words heard being directly impressed upon her mind, and giving her wonderful strength in trials, reprimanding her for unfaithfulness, and consoling her in trouble. Unable to reconcile such <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> with her shortcomings, which her delicate <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> represented as grievous faults, she had recourse not only to the most spiritual confessors she could find, but also to some saintly <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, who, never suspecting that the account she gave them of her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> was greatly exaggerated, believed these manifestations to be the work of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">evil spirit</a>. The more she endeavoured to resist them the more powerfully did <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> work in her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The whole city of <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a> was troubled by the reports of the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> of this <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>. It was reserved to <a href="../cathen/06213a.htm">St. Francis Borgia</a> and <a href="../cathen/11770c.htm">St. Peter of Alcantara</a>, and afterwards to a number of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> (particularly Pedro Iba&ntilde;ez and <a href="../cathen/02247a.htm">Domingo Ba&ntilde;ez</a>), <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and other religious and <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, to discern the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to guide her on a safe road.

<p>The account of her spiritual life contained in the "Life written by herself" (completed in 1565, an earlier version being lost), in the "Relations", and in the "Interior Castle", forms one of the most remarkable spiritual biographies with which only the <a href="../fathers/1101.htm">"Confessions of St. Augustine"</a> can bear comparison. To this period belong also such extraordinary manifestations as the piercing or transverberation of her heart, the spiritual espousals, and the <a href="../cathen/09703a.htm">mystical marriage</a>. A <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> of the place destined for her in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> in case she should have been unfaithful to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, determined her to seek a more <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a> life. After many troubles and much opposition St. Teresa founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/05028a.htm">Discalced</a> <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Nuns of the Primitive Rule of St. Joseph at <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a> (24 Aug., 1562), and after six months obtained permission to take up her residence there. Four years later she received the visit of the General of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, John-Baptist Rubeo (Rossi), who not only approved of what she had done but granted leave for the foundation of other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. In rapid succession she established her <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> at Medina del Campo (1567), Malagon and Valladolid (1568), Toledo and Pastrana (1569), Salamanca (1570), Alba de Tormes (1571), Segovia (1574), Veas and Seville (1575), and Caravaca (1576). In the "Book of Foundations" she tells the story of these <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, nearly all of which were established in spite of violent opposition but with manifest assistance from above. Everywhere she found <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> generous enough to embrace the austerities of the primitive rule of <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmel</a>. Having made the acquaintance of Antonio de Heredia, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Medina, and <a href="../cathen/08480a.htm">St. John of the Cross</a>, she established her <a href="../cathen/12711a.htm">reform</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> (28 Nov., 1568), the first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> being those of Duruelo (1568), Pastrana (1569), Mancera, and Alcal&aacute; de Henares (1570).

<p>A new epoch began with the entrance into religion of <a href="../cathen/06729d.htm">Jerome Gratian</a>, inasmuch as this remarkable man was almost immediately entrusted by the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> with the authority of visitor Apostolic of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of the old observance in <a href="../cathen/01465b.htm">Andalusia</a>, and as such considered himself entitled to overrule the various restrictions insisted upon by the general and the general chapter. On the death of the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> and the arrival of his successor a fearful storm burst over St. Teresa and her work, lasting four years and threatening to annihilate the nascent <a href="../cathen/12711a.htm">reform</a>. The incidents of this <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> are best described in her letters. The storm at length passed, and the province of <a href="../cathen/05028a.htm">Discalced</a> <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, with the support of Philip II, was approved and canonically established on 22 June, 1580. St. Teresa, old and broken in health, made further foundations at Villanuava de la Jara and Palencia (1580), Soria (1581), <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a> (through her assistant the Venerable Anne of Jesus), and at <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a> (1582). She left this latter place at the end of July, and, stopping at <a href="../cathen/11417c.htm">Palencia</a>, <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, and Medina del Campo, reached Alba de Torres in September, suffering intensely. Soon she took to her bed and passed away on 4 Oct., 1582, the following day, owing to the reform of the calendar, being reckoned as 15 October. After some years her body was transferred to <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a>, but later on reconveyed to Alba, where it is still preserved incorrupt. Her heart, too, showing the marks of the Transverberation, is exposed there to the veneration of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. She was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> in 1614, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1622 by <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a>, the feast being fixed on 15 October.

<p>St. Teresa's position among writers on <a href="../cathen/14621a.htm">mystical theology</a> is unique. In all her writings on this subject she deals with her personal experiences, which a deep insight and analytical gifts enabled her to explain clearly. The <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> substratum may be traced to the influence of her confessors and directors, many of whom belonged to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>. She herself had no pretension to found a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in the accepted sense of the term, and there is no vestige in her writings of any influence of the <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Areopagite</a>, the Patristic, or the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> Mystical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, as represented among others, by the German <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Mystics. She is intensely personal, her system going exactly as far as her experiences, but not a step further.

<p>A word must be added on the orthography of her name. It has of late become the fashion to write her name Teresa or Teresia, without "h", not only in Spanish and Italian, where the "h" could have no place, but also in French, German, and Latin, which ought to preserve the etymological spelling. As it is derived from a Greek name, <em>Tharasia</em>, the saintly wife of <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">St. Paulinus of Nola</a>, it should be written Theresia in German and Latin, and Th&eacute;r&egrave;se in French.
