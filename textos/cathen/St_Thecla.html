<h1>St. Thecla</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Kitzingen and Ochsenfurt; <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; d. at Kitzingen about 790 or later. <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, Apostle of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, kept up a constant intimate correspondence with the community of <a href="../cathen/15648a.htm">Wimborne</a>, Dorset, and from the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>, Tetta, in 748-49, he obtained monastic colonies for <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Among these <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> one of the most illustrious for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and learning was Thecla, a relative of St. Lioba, whom she accompanied from <a href="../cathen/15648a.htm">Wimborne</a> and under whose rule she lived for some time at Tauberbischofsheim, until <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> appointed her <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> of the newly founded <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at Ochsenfurt. Later, on the death of St. Adelheid, or Hadelonga, the foundress and first <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Kitzingen on the Main, she was called to rule that <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> while still retaining the government of Ochsenfurt. The Roman as well as the English and <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Martyrology commemorate her on 15 October; others on 27 or 28 September. The name Thecla does not appear on the list of the abbesses of Kitzingen, but it is generally thought that she is designated as Heilga, or "the saint"; unless we admit this, the list must be considered interpolated. Among <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface's</a> letters is one addressed to Lioba, Thecla, and Cynehilde, as the heads of separate <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities. Its tone reveals how far the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> had entered as intelligent fellow-labourers into his apostolate. <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> seems to have had a threefold purpose in summoning these Anglo-Saxon <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> as his auxiliaries: to propagate the full observance of the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Benedictine Rule</a> by new foundations; to introduce it into already founded <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and to restore its observance in others; and finally to bring their gentle influence to bear on the fierce Teuton <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, both by example and by the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> imparted to their children. The ruined Chapel of St. Thecla, on an islet in the Severn, may have been dedicated to her, as Walstod, a Saxon <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was set over that part at this time. Some have tried to prove St. Thecla one of the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of Barking to whom <a href="../cathen/01280b.htm">St. Aldhelm</a> dedicated his "Treatise on Virginity, but as this treatise was written before 705, and as St. Lioba went to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> about 748-49, it is evident that her disciple who survived her was not this <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> of Barking.

<p>Ochsenfurt gradually declined, most probably owing to its proximity to Kitzingen. There is no record of its having any other <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> after St. Thecla. Kitzingen was used for secular purposes by the margraves of <a href="../cathen/02738c.htm">Brandenburg</a>, to whom it had been mortgaged from 1440 to 1629, when it was redeemed by Philip Adolphus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, and restored by John Godfrey of Guttenberg as a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>. In 1803 the institute of the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> was secularized, and today the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church is in the hands of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and serves as their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church. The <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of St. Thecla and St. Adelheid in this church were profaned in the Peasants War,1525; a fanatic of Kitzingen used the heads to play at skittles; when the church was rebuilt (1695), the venerable bodies were covered with rubbish. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> contains a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls, a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys, apartments for some teachers, and the district court. The <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess's</a> castle is private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>.
