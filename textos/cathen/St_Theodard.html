<h1>St. Theodard</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Narbonne, b. at <a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">Montauban</a> about 840; d. at the same place 1 May, 893. He seems to have belonged to a noble and wealthy <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and to have studied with great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> both <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and secular learning in his youth. He gave <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and skill when he was a <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> at a synod at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> that was called upon to settle a dispute between the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of the place and Bishop Bernhard. In this way the presiding officer of the synod, Archbishop Sigebod of Narbonne (873-855), came to have so high an opinion of Theodard that he made him his <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>. In this position Theodard distinguished himself by faultless <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, modesty, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and charitableness, and was "eyes to the blind, feet to the lame, a father to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and the consoler of all the oppressed". After Sigebod's death (885) Theodard was elected his successor, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 15 August, 885, and in 886 went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to obtain the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> from Stephen VI. Theodard maintained with energy the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> and its suffragans, repaired the damages that these <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> had suffered from the incursions of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, restored the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and gave up his revenues and the treasures of his church for the release of captive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. At a later date he was able to replace the treasures he had used. He died where he had lived in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of St. Martin and was buried there. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> bore his name from 845. It was later plundered by the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>; since then all the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Theodard, excepting a small remnant, have disappeared.
