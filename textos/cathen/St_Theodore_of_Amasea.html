<h1>St. Theodore of Amasea</h1>  

<p>Surnamed Tyro (Tiro), not because he was a young recruit, but because for a time he belonged to the Cohors Tyronum (<a href="../cathen/11078a.htm">Nilles</a>, Kal. man., I, 105), called of Amasea from the place where he suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and Euchaita from the place, Euchais, to which his body had been carried, and where he was held in such veneration that the city was frequently spoken of as Theodoropolis. His <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> seems to have taken place 17 Feb., 306, under the Emperors <a href="../cathen/06341a.htm">Galerius Maximian</a> and <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Maximian</a>, for on this day the <a href="../cathen/10191b.htm">Menologies</a> give his feast. The Greeks and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> him also on the first Saturday of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, while the Roman Martyrology records him on 9 Nov. In the twelfth century his body was transferred to <a href="../cathen/02787e.htm">Brindisi</a>, and he is there <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as patron; his head is enshrined at <a href="../cathen/06333a.htm">Gaeta</a>. There are churches bearing his name at Constantinople, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, and other places of the East. An ancient church of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, of which he is titular, is said to have been built by Narses. At the foot of the Palatine in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is a very old church, circular in shape and dedicated to S. Teodoro, whom the Roman people call S. Toto, which was made a collegiate church by <a href="../cathen/06031a.htm">Felix IV</a>. The people showed their confidence in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> by bringing their sick children to his temple. His <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is represented in the choir of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a> by thirty-eight glass <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of the thirteenth century (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, "Dict. iconogr.", 599). He is invoked against storms. Emblems: temple, torch, crocodile, pyre, crown of thorns.

<p><a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a> delivered a panegyric on his feast and gave several data concerning his life and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> (P.G., XLVI, 741, and Ruinart, 505). The oldest text of the "Martyrium S. Theodori Tironis" was published by Delehaye in "Les legendes grecques des saints militaires", p. 227, but it is considered largely interpolated (Anal. Boll., XXX, 323). St. Theodore is said to have been born in the East (Syria or <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> are mentioned by some writers). He enlisted in the army and was sent with his cohort to winter quarters in <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>. When the edict against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> was issued by the emperors, he was brought before the Court at Amasea and asked to offer sacrifice to the gods. Theodore, however, denied their existence and made a noble profession of his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. The judges, pretending pity for his youth, gave him time for reflection. This he employed in burning the Temple of Cybele. He was again taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, and after many cruel torments was burned at the stake.
