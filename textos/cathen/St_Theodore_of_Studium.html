<h1>St. Theodore of Studium</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> champion of the veneration of images and the last geat representative of the unity and independence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the East, b. in 759; d. on the Peninsula of Tryphon, near the promontory Akrita on 11 November, 826. He belonged to a very distinguished <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and like his two brothers, one of whom, Joseph, became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, was highly <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>. In 781 theodore entered the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Saccudion on the <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> side of the Bosphorus near Constantinople, where his uncle <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. In 787 or 788 Theodore was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and in 794 succeeded his uncle. He insisted upon the exact observance of the monastic rules. During the Adulterine <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> dispute (see <a href="../cathen/11050a.htm">S<font size=-2>AINT</font> N<font size=-2>ICEPHORUS</font></a>), concerning the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> and remarriage of the Emperor Constantine VI, he was banished by Constantine VI to <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, but returned in triumph after the emperor's overthrow. In 799 he left Saccudion, which was threatened by the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, and took charge of the <a href="../cathen/14316c.htm">monastery of the Studium</a> at Constantinople. He gave the <a href="../cathen/14316c.htm">Studium</a> an excellent organization which was taken as a model by the entire Byzantine monastic world, and still exists on <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Mount Athos</a> and in Russian monasticism. He supplemented the somewhat theoretical rules of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> by specific regulations concerning enclosure, poverty, discipline, study, religious services, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, and manual labour. When the Adulterine <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> dispute broke out again in 809, he was exiled a second time as the head of the strictly <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> church part, but was recalled in 811. The administration of the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">iconoclastic</a> Emperor Leo V brought new and more severe trials. Theodore <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageously</a> denied the emperor's right to interfere in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs. He was consequently treated with great cruelty, exiled, and his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> filled with <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">iconoclastic</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. Theodore lived at Metopa in Bithynia from 814, then at Bonita from 819, and finally at <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>. Even in banishment he was the central point of the opposition to C&aelig;saropapism and <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclasm</a>. Michael II (810-9) permitted the exiles to return, but did not annul the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of his predecessor. Thus Theodore saw himself compelled to continue the struggle. He did not return to the <a href="../cathen/14316c.htm">Studium</a>, and died without having attained his ideals. In the Roman Martyrology his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is placed on 12 November; in the Greek <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> on 11 November.

<p>Theodore was a man of practical bent and never wrote any <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works, except a dogmatic treatise on the veneration of images. Many of his works are still unprinted or exist in Old Slavonic and Russian translations. Besides several polemics against the enemies of images, special mention should be made of the "Catechesis magna", and the "Catechesis parva" with their sonorous sermons and orations. His writings on monastic life are: the iambic verses on the monastic offices, his will addressed to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, the "Canones", and the "P&aelig;n&aelig; monasteriales", the regulations for the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and for the church services. His <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and epigrams show fiery feeling and a high spirit. He is one of the first of hymn-writers in productiveness, in a peculiarly creative technic, and in elegance of language. 550 letters testify to his ascetical and ecclesiastico-political labours.
