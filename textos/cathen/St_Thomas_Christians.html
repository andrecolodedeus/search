<h2 id="i">Their early traditions and their connection with the apostle St. Thomas</h2>

<p>Interest in the history of these <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> arises from more than one feature. Their ancient descent at once attracts attention. Theophilus (surnamed the Indian) &#151; an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>, sent by Emperor Constantius (about 354) on a mission to Arabia Felix and <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> &#151; is one of the earliest, if not the first, who draws our attention to them. He had been sent when very young a hostage <em>a Divoeis</em>, by the inhabitants of the Maldives, to the Romans in the reign of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>. His travels are recorded by Philostorgius, an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> Greek <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">Church historian</a>, who relates that Theophilus, after fulfilling his mission to the Homerites, sailed to his island home. Thence he visited other parts of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, reforming many things &#151; for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the place heard the reading of the Gospel in a sitting, etc. This reference to a body of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> with church, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, liturgy, in the immediate vicinity of the Maldives, can only apply to a <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> and faithful on the adjacent coast of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and not to <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>, which was well known even then under its own designation, Taprobane. The people referred to were the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> known as a body who had their liturgy in the Syriac language and inhabited the west coast of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, i.e. Malabar. This Church is next mentioned and located by <a href="../cathen/04404a.htm">Cosmas Indicopleustes</a> (about 535) "in Male (Malabar) where the pepper grows"; and he adds that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Ceylon, whom he specifies as <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, and "those of <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a>" (the latter he leaves unspecified, so they must have been natives of the country) had a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> residing at Caliana (Kalyan), <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and one likewise on the island of Socotra.

<h2 id="ii">The apostle's tomb at Mylapur</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a> (Glor. Mart.), before 590, reports that Theodore, a pilgrim who had gone to <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, told him that in that part of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> where the <em>corpus</em> (bones) of <a href="../cathen/14658b.htm">Thomas the Apostle</a> had first rested (Mylapur on the east or the Coromandel Coast of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>) there stood a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and a church of striking dimensions and elaboratedly adorned, adding: "After a long interval of time these remains had been removed thence to the city of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>." The location of the first <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the Apostle in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> both of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> and of its Apostolate in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. The evidence of Theodore is that of an eyewitness who had visited both <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> &#151; the first in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, while the second was at <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>. The primitive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, therefore, found on both coasts, east and west, witness to and locate the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> at Mylapur, "St. Thomas", a little to the south of <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>; no other place in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> lays any claim to possess the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, nor does any other country. On these facts is based their claim to be known as St. Thomas <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.

<h2 id="iii">This upheld by the Edessan Church</h2>

<p>Further <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> may be adduced to justify this claim. A Syrian <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> calender of an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> confirms the above. In the quotation given below two points are to be noted which support its antiquity &#151; the fact of the name given to <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> and the fact the memory of the translation of the Apostle's <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> was so fresh to the writer that the name of the individual who had brought them was yet remembered. The entry reads: "3 July, St. Thomas who was pierced with a lance in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. His body is at Urhai [the ancient name of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>] having been brought there by the merchant Khabin. A great festival." It is only natural to expect that we should receive from <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> first-hand evidence of the removal of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> to that city; and we are not disappointed, for <a href="../cathen/05498a.htm">St. Ephraem</a>, the great doctor of the Syrian Church, has left us ample details in his writings. Ephraem came to <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> on the surrender of <a href="../cathen/11084c.htm">Nisibis</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, and he lived there from 363 to 373, when he died. This <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> is found mostly in his rhythmical compositions. In the forty-second of his "Carmina Nisibina" he tells us the Apostle was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and that his remains were subsequently buried in <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, brought there by a merchant. But his name is never given; at that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the name had dropped out of popular memory. The same is repeated in varying form in several of his <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> edited by Lamy (Ephr. Hymni et Sermones, IV). "It was to a land of dark people he was sent, to clothe them by Baptism in white robes. His grateful dawn dispelled <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India's</a> painful darkness. It was his mission to espouse <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> to the One-Begotten. The merchant is blessed for having so great a treasure. <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> thus became the blessed city by possessing the greatest pearl <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> could yield. Thomas works <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and at <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> Thomas is destined to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> peoples perverse and steeped in darkness, and that in the land of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>."


<h2 id="iv">For their earliest period they possess no written but a traditional history</h2>

<p>These <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> have no written records of the incidents of their social life from the time of their conversion down to the arrival of the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> on the coast, just as <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> had no history until the arrival of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>.

<h2 id="v">Record of these traditions embodied in a manuscript statement dated 1604</h2>

<p>Fortunately the British Museum has a large collection consisting of several folio volumes containing <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, letters, reports, etc., of <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missions in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> and elsewhere; among these in additional volume 9853, beginning with the leaf 86 in pencil and 525 in ink, there is a "Report" on the "Serra" (the name by which the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> designated Malabar), written in Portuguese by a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary, bearing the date 1604 but not signed by the writer; there is evidence that this "Report" was known to F. de Souza, author of the "Oriente Conquistado", and utilized by him. The writer has carefully put together the traditional record of these <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; the document is yet unpublished, hence its importance. Extracts from the same, covering what can be said of the early part of this history, will offer the best guarantee that can be offered. The writer of the "Report" distinctly informs us that these <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> had no written records of ancient history, but relied entirely on traditions handed down by their elders, and to these they were most tenaciously attached.

<p>Of their earliest period tradition records that after the death of the Apostle his disciples remained faithful for a long time, the Faith was propagated with great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> increased considerably. But later, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and famine supervening, the St. Thomas <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Mylapur got scattered and sought refuge elsewhere, and many of them returned to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, however, who were on the Cochin side, fared better than the former, spreading from Coulac (Quilon) to Palur (Paleur), a village in the north of <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a>. These had fared better, as they lived under native princes who rarely interfered with their Faith, and they probably never suffered real <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> such as befell their brethren on the other coast; besides, one of the paramount rajahs of <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a>, Cheruman Perumal, had conferred on them a civil status. The common tradition in the country holds that from the time of the Apostle seven churches were erected in different parts of the country, besides the one which the Apostle himself had erected at Mylapur. This tradition is most tenaciously held and is confirmed by the "Report". It further asserts that the Apostle Thomas, after preaching to the inhabitants of the Island of Socotra and establishing there a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community, had come over to Malabar and landed at the ancient port of Cranganore. They hold that after preaching in Malabar the Apostle went over to Mylapur on the Coromandel Coast; this is practicable through any of the many paths across the dividing mountain ranges which were well known and much frequented in olden times. The Socotrians had yet retained their Faith when in 1542 St. Francis visited them on his way to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. In a letter of 18 September of the same year, addressed to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he has left an interesting account of the degenerate state of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> he found there, who were <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>. He also tells us they render special honours to the Apostle St. Thomas, claiming to be descendants of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> begotten to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> by that Apostle. By 1680 when the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Vincenzo Maria di Santa Catarina landed there he found Christanity quite extinct, only faint traces yet lingering. The extinction of this primitive Christanity is due to the oppression of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, who now form the main population of the island, and to the scandalous neglect of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Patriarchs who in former times were wont to supply the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> for the island. When St. Francis visited the island a <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was still in charge.

<h2 id="vi">The Syrian merchant Thomas Cana arrives in Malabar</h2>

<p>There is one incident of the long period of isolation of the St. Thomas <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> from the rest of the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a> which they are never tired of relating, and it is one of considerable importance to them for the civil status it conferred and secured to them in the country. This is the narrative of the arrival of a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> merchant on their shores, a certain Mar Thoma Cana &#151; the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> have named him Cananeo and styled him an <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, which he was not. He arrived by ship on the coast and entered the port of Cranganore. The King of Malabar, Cheruman Perumal, was in the vicinity, and receiving information of his arrival sent for him and admitted him to his presence. Thomas was a wealthy merchant who had probably come to trade; the King took a liking to this man, and when he expressed a wish to acquire land and make a settlement the King readily acceded to his request and let him purchase land, then unoccupied, at Cranganore. Under the king's orders Thomas soon collected a number of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> from the surrounding country, which enabled him to start a town on the ground marked out for his occupation. He is said to have collected seventy-two <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> (this is the traditional number always mentioned) and to have installed them in as many separate houses erected for them; attach to each dwelling was a sufficient piece of land for vegetable cultivation for the support of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> as is the custom of the country. He also erected a dwelling for himself and eventually a church. The authorization to possess the land and dwellings erected was granted to Thomas by a deed of paramount Lord and Rajah of Malabar, Cheruman Perumal, said to have been the last of the line, the country having been subsequently divided among his feudatories. (The details given above as well as what follows of the copper plate grant are taken from the "Report".) The same accord also speak of several privileges and honours by the king to Thomas himself, his descendants, and to the Thomas <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, by which the latter community obtained status above the lower classes, and which made them equal to the Nayars, the middle class in the country.

<p>The deed read as follows: <blockquote>May Cocurangon [personal name of the king] be prosperous, enjoy a long life and live 100,000 years, divine servant of the gods, strong, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, just, full of deeds, reasonable, powerful over the whole earth, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, conquering, glorious, rightly prosperous in the service of the gods, in <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a>, in the city of the Mahadeva [the great idol of the temple in the vicinity of Cranganore] reigning in the year of Mercury on the seventh day [Portuguese text: elle no tepo de Mercurio de feu to no dia, etc.] of the mouth of March before the full moon the same king Cocurangon being in Carnallur there landed Thomas Cana, a chief man who arrived in a ship wishing to see the farthest parts of the East. And some men seeing how he arrived informed the king. The king himself came and saw and sent for the chief man Thomas, and he disembarked and came before the king, who spoke graciously to him. To <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> him he gave him his name, styling him Cocurangon Cana, and he went to rest in his place, and the king gave him the city of Mogoderpatanam, (Cranganore) for ever. And the same king being in his great prosperity went one day to hunt in the forest, and he hastily sent for Thomas, who came and stood before the king in a propitious hour, and the king consulted the <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrologer</a>. And afterwards the king spoke to Thomas that he should build a town in that forest, and he made reverence and answered the king: I require this forest for myself', and the king granted it to him for ever. And forthwith another day he cleared the forest and he cast his eyes upon it in the same year on the eleventh of April, and in a propetious time gave it to Thomas for a heritage in the name of the king, who laid the first stone of the church and the house of Thomas Cana, and he built there a town for all, and entered the church and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> there on the same day. After these things Thomas himself went to the feet of the king and offered his gifts, and this he asked the king to give that land to him and his descendants; and he measured out two hundred and sixty-four elephant cubits and gave them to Thomas and his descendants for ever, and jointly sixty-two houses which immediately erected there, and gardens with their enclosures and paths and boundaries and inner yards. And he granted seven kinds of musical instruments and all honours and the right of travelling in a palanquin, and he conferred on him dignity and the privilege of spreading carpets on the ground and the use of sandals, and to erect a pavilion at his gate and ride on elephants, and also granted five taxes to Thomas and his companions, both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, for all his relations and to the followers of his law for ever.

<p>The said king gave his name and these princes witnessed it...</blockquote>

<p>Then follow the names of eight witnesses, and a note is added by the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> translator that this is the document by which the Emperor of all Malabar gave the land of Cranganore to Thomas Cana and also to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of St. Thomas. This document, transcribed from the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> "Report", has been carefully translated into English, as it forms the "Great Charter" of the St. Thomas <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. The "Report" adds: "and because at that time they reckoned the era in cycles of twelve years according to the course, therefore they say in the Olla [Malayalam term for a document written on palm leaf] that the said settlement was founded in the year of the mercury... that mode of reckoning is totally forgotten, for the last seven hundred and seventy-nine years in all this Malabar time has been reckoned by the Quilon era. However, since the said Perumal, as we have said above, died more than a thousand and two hundred years, it follows: that same number of years have elapsed since the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were established at Cranganore." The writer of the "Report" had previously stated "it is one thousand and two hundred and fifty and eight years since Perumal, as we have said above, died on the first of March". Deducing the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the "Report" this would give A.D. 346 for his death. Diego de Couto (<em>Decada XII</em>), quoting the above grant in full, says that the Syrian <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> fix A.D. 811 as corresponding to the date borne on the grant; the first is far too early, and the second is an approximately probable date. The "Report" informs us that the copper plates on which this deed or grant was inscribed were taken away to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> by <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Fathers, who left behind a translation of the same. It is known that the Syrian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a>, Mar Jacob, had deposited with the Factor of <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a> all the Syrian copper grants for safe custody; providing however that when <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> access could be had to the same. Gouvea at p. 4 of his "Jornada" says that after having remained there for some long time they could not be found and were lost through some carelessness; de Couto asserts the same in the passage quoted above and also elsewhere. In 1806 at the suggestion of Rev. Claude Buchanan, Colonel Macauly, the British resident, ordered a careful search for them and they turned up in the record room of <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a> town. The tables then contained (1) the grant to Irani Cortton of Cranganore, and (2) the set of plates of the grant to Maruvan Sopi Iso of <a href="../cathen/12610a.htm">Quilon</a>, but those of the grant to Thomas Cana were not among them; had they not been removed they would have been found with other plates; this confirms the statement of the writer of the "Report" that they had been taken to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. From what is stated in the royal deed to Thomas Cana it may be taken for granted that the latter brought with him a small colony of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> from Mesopotamia, for the privileges conceded include his companions, both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and all his relations.

<h2 id="vii">The arrival also of two pious brothers, church-builders</h2>

<p>Besides the arrival of Thomas Cana and his colony, by which the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> benefited considerably, the "Report" also records the arrival on this coast of two <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> named Soper Iso and Prodho; they are said to have been brothers and are supposed to have been Syrians. The "Report" gives the following details; they came to possess a promontory opposite Paliport on the north side, which is called Maliankara, and they entered the port with a large load of timber to build a church; and in the Chaldean books of this Serra there is no mention of them, except that they were brothers, came to <a href="../cathen/12610a.htm">Quilon</a>, built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> there, and worked some <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. After death they were buried in the church they had erected; it is said that they had built other smaller churches in the country; they were regarded as <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> men and were later called <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, their own church was eventually dedicated to them as well as others in the country. Archbishop Alexis Menezes afterwards changed the dedication of these churches to other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in the Roman calender. There is one important item that the "Report" has preserved: "the said brothers built the church of <a href="../cathen/12610a.htm">Quilon</a> in the hundredth year after the foundation of <a href="../cathen/12610a.htm">Quilon</a>." (This era commences from 25 August, A.D. 825, and the date will thus be A.D. 925). The second of the aforesaid copper-plates mention Meruvan Sober Iso, one of the above brothers. The "Report" also makes mention of pilgrims coming from Mesopotamia to visit the shrine of the Apostle at Mylapur; some of these at times would settle there and others in <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a>. It may be stated here that the Syrians of Malabar are as a body natives of the land by descent, and the Syriac trait in them is that of their liturgy, which is in the Syrian language. They call themselves Syrians by way of distinction from other body of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> on the coast, who belong to the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>. The honorific appellation bestowed upon them by the rulers of the country is that of <em>Mapla</em>, which signifies great son or child, and they were commonly so called by the people; this appellation also have been given to the descendants of <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> in the country; the St. Thomas <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> now prefer to be called <em>Nasrani</em> (Nazarenes), the designation given by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> to all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.

<h2 id="viii">Ancient stone crosses and their inscriptions</h2>

<p>There are certain stone crosses of ancient date in southern <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, bearing inscriptions in Pahlavi letters. Extraordinary legends have been spread about them in some parts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>; the present writer was shown an engraving purporting to reproduce one of them, with a legend of the Apostolate and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of St. Thomas, a reproduction of the inscription on his crosses. This was attached to the calender of one of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and this writer was asked if it were authentic.

<p>To prevent the spreading of such reports it may be useful to state here of these crosses one is in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Mount St. Thomas, Mylapur, discovered in 1547 after the arrival of the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>; other is in the church of Kottayam, Malabar. Both are of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> origin, are engraved as a <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-relief</a> on the flat stone with ornamental decorations around the cross, and bear an inscription. The inscription has been variously read. Dr. Burnell, an Indian antiquary, says that both crosses bear the same inscription, and offer the following reading: "In punishment by the cross was the suffering of this one, Who is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Christ, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above and Guide ever pure." These crosses bear some resemblance to the Syro-Chinese <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> monument discovered in 1625 at Singan-fu, an ancient capital of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> but erected in 781 and commemorating the arrival in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> of Chaldean <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> missionaries in 636.

<h2 id="ix">Their early prelates</h2>

<p>Of the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who governed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> after the Apostle's death very little is known; that little is collected and reproduced here. John the Persian, who was present at the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nice</a> (325), is the first known to history claiming the title. In his signature to the degrees of the Council he styles himself; John the Persian [presiding] over the churches in all <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> and Great <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. The designation implies that he was the [<a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>] <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> and also the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Great <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. As <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and the chief <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the East he may have represented at the council the Catholics of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a>. His control of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> could only have been exercised by his sending <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> under his juridiction to minister to those <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. It is not known at what date <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> first commenced to have resident <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; but between the years 530-35 <a href="../cathen/04404a.htm">Cosmas Indicopleustes</a> in his "topographia" informs us of the presence of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> residing in Caliana, the modern Kalyan at a short distance from <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>. That residence was, in all probability, chosen because it was then the chief port of commerce on the west coast of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and had easy access and communication with <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> later of a contention which took place between Jesuab of Adiabene the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Patriarch and Simeon of Ravardshir, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, who had left <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> unprovided with <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for a long period. The Patriarch reproached him severely for this gross neglect. We may take it that up to the period 650-60 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> sent to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, as Cosmas has said, were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, but after this gross neglect the patriarch reserved to himself the choice and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> he sent out to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and this practice was continued till the arrival of the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> on the coast in 1504.

<p><a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> places the two brothers Soper Iso and Prodho on the list of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, but Indian tradition gives it no support, and in this the British Museum Manuscript Report and Gouvea (Jornada, p. 5) concur. The brothers were known as church-builders, and were reputed to be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men. Moreover, to include Thomas Cana in the lists of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is preposterous on the face of the evidence of the copper-plate grant. The "Report" mentions a long period when there was neither <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> nor <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> surviving in the land, for they had all died out; the only <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> survival was a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> far advanced in age. The <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, finding themselves without <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, made him say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> and even <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordain</a> others, but as soon as <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> came from Babylon they put a stop to this disorder. The next authentic information we have on this head comes from the Vatican Library and has been published by Assemani (Bibli. Or., III, 589). It consists of a statement concerning two <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and their companions and a letter the former written in Syriac to the Patriarch announcing their arrival, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1504; there is a translation in Latin added to the documents. In 1490 the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Malabar dispatched three messengers to ask the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Patriarch to send out <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; one died on the journey, the other two presented themselves before the Patriarch and delivered their message; two <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were selected and the Patriach <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> them <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, assigning to one the name of Thomas and to the other that of John. The two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> started on their journey to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> accompanied by the two messengers. On their arrival they were received with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> by the people, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> commenced consecrating <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altars</a> and ordaining a large number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> "as they had been for a long time deprived of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>". One of them, John, remained in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, while the other Thomas, accompanied by Joseph, one of the messengers, returned to Mesopotamia, taking with them the offerings collected for the patriarch. Joseph returned to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> in 1493, but Thomas remained in Mesopotamia.

<p>After about ten years, when the next patriarch <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> three other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, Thomas went back with them. These new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were also chosen from the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, one was named Jaballa (he was the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>), the second was named Denha, and the third Jacob. These four <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> took ship from Ormus and landed at Kananur; they found there some twenty Portuguese who had recently arrived and presented themselves to them, said they were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, explained their condition and rank, and were kindly treated. Of this large number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, only one remained to work, and this was Mar Jacob; the other three, including the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, after a short time returned to their country. Gouvea adds that they were either dissatisfied with their charge or did not like the country. The <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> writers mention only two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as residents, John who had come before their arrival in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> and Mar Jacob. Nothing further is known of John but Jacob lived in the country till his death. <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> makes a very pretty <em>elogium</em> of him in a letter written to King John III of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> on 26 January, 1549. "Mar Jacob [or Jacome Abuna, as St. Francis styles him] for forty-five years has served <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and your Highness in these parts, a very old, a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, and a holy man, and at the same time unnoticed by your Highness and by almost all in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rewards him . . . He is noticed only by the Fathers of St. Francis, and they take so good care of him that nothing more is wanted . . . He has laboured much among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of St. Thomas, and now in his old age he is very <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to the customs of the Holy Mother Church of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>." This <em>elogium</em> of St. Francis sums up his career for the forty-five years he worked in Malabar (1504-49). He came out as a <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a>, remained such during his early years, but gradually as he came in touch with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries he allowed them to preach in his churches and to instruct his people; in his old age he left Cranganore and went to live in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a> and there he died in 1549. There remain two others &#151; the last of the Mesopotamian <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who presided over these <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> &#151; Mar Joseph and Mar Abraham; their career will be detailed further on.

<h2 id="x">Were these Christians infected with Nestorianism before 1599?</h2>

<p>When Cosmas gave us the information of the existence of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community in "Male (Malabar) where the pepper is grown" he also supplied us with additional details: that they have a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> residing at Kalyan; that in Taprobano [ Ceylon] "an island of interior <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> where the Indian Ocean is situated" there is a "Christian Church with <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the faithful; similarly in the island of Dioscordis [Socotra] in the same Indian Ocean." Then he enumerates the churches in Arabia Felix, Bactria, and among the Huns; and all these churches are by him represented to be controlled by the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. Now at that time the holder of this dignity was Patrick, the tutor, as Assemani designates him, of Thomas of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, a prominent <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> to which <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> Cosmas also belonged; hence his interest in supplying all these details. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> whom the Metropolitan, Patrick, would send out to all the above-mentioned places and churches would and must have been undoubtedly infected with one and the same <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Hence it is quite safe to conclude that at the time of the visit of Cosmas to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> (A.D. 530-35) all these churches, as also the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, were holding the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Nor should this historical fact cause surprise when we take into consideration the opportunities, the bold attitude and violent measures adopted by the promoters of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> after expulsion from the Roman Empire. When the Emperor Zeno ordered Cyrus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, to purge his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> (A.D. 489), the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> were forced to seek refuge across the Roman boundary into <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. Among them were the banished professors and students of the Persian School of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, the centre of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and they found refuge and protection with Barsumas, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/11084c.htm">Nisibis</a>, himself a fanatical adherent of Nestorius. Barsumas at this time also held from the Persian king the office of governor of the frontier.

<p>With the influence Barsumas possessed at court it was an easy thing for him to make the king, already so disposed, believe that the actual <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> holding sees in his territory were friendly to his enemies, the Romans, and that it would be better to replace them by men he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> who would owe allegiance only to the Persian monarch. This stratagem rapidly succeeded in capturing most of those sees; and the movement became so strong that, although Barsumas predeceased Acka (Acacius), the occupant of the chief see of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, yet a <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> was selected to succeed the latter (A.D. 496). Thus within the short space of seven years the banished <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> sat mistress on the throne of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a>, in a position to force every existing see eastward of the Roman Empire to embrace the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and to secure its permanence. Thus the Indian Church suffered the same fate which befell the Churches of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and by 530-35 we find that she has a <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> and presiding at Kalyan over her future destiny. If further <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> is wanted to uphold the above finding, we offer the following historical facts of the control exercised by the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Patriarch. In 650-60, as above stated, Jesuab of Adiabene claimed authority over <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> and reproached Simeon of Revardshir, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, for not having sent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> and so deprived that Church of the succession of her ministry. In 714-28 Saliba Zacha, another <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Patriarch, raised the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> to <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> rank. Again in 857 Theodosius, another <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Patriarch, included the See of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> among the exempted which, owing to distance from the patriarchal see, should in future send letters of communion but once in six years. This ruling was subsequently incorporated in a synodal canon.

<p>If we look to the general tradition of the St. Thomas <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> it will be found that all their <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> came from Babylon, the ancient residence as they say, of the Patriarch or <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">Catholicos</a> of the East. It is further known and acknowledged by them that whenever they remained deprived of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for a long time, they used to send messengers to that Patriarchate asking that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> be sent out to them. Sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this practice has been given above when discussing the arrival of four <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in 1504. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> was fully aware that the Malabar <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were under the control of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Patriarch. When <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a> gave Sulaka his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> as the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Chaldean patriarch, he distinctly laid down the same extent of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> which had been claimed and controlled by his late <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> predecessor; hence in the last clause it is distinctly laid down: "In Sin Massin et Calicuth et tota <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>." It becomes <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to fix this historical <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> clearly, because some in Malabar deny this historical fact. They would wish people to believe that all the Portuguese missionaries, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and writers were completely mistaken when they styled them <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> in <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, and because of this <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> report all subsequent writers continued to call them <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>. The reader who has gone through the statement of facts above related must be conscious that such an attempt at distorting or boldly denying public facts is utterly hopeless. They maintain, in support of their <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> view, that there always had been a small body among the Chaldeans in Mesopotamia who remained attached to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith, and from them they received their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. This plea is historically <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> they received all came to them from the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, and as to the hypothesis of the existence during all these centuries back of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party among the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Chaldeans, it is too absurd to be discussed. It was only after the conversion of Sulaka in 1552 that the Chaldeans in part returned to the unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is that the Malabar Church remained from A.D. 496 up till then in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.

<h2 id="xi">Medieval travellers on the Thomas Christians</h2>

<p>During the centuries that these <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were isolated from the rest of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, their sole intercourse was limited to Mesopotamia, whence the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Patriarch would from time to time supply them with <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. But from the close of the thirteenth century Western travellers, chiefly missionaries sent out by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, sent to the West occasional news of their existence. Some of these it will be useful to reproduce here. The first who informed the world of the existence of these St. Thomas <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> was Friar John of Monte Corvino. After he had spent several years as a missionary in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> and adjoining countries, he proceeded to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, passing through the Indian ports between the years 1292 and 1294. He tells us in a letter written from Cambales (Peking) in 1305 that he had remained thirteen months in that part of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> where the Church of St. Thomas the Apostle stood (Mylapore); he also <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in different places about one hundred <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. In the same letter he says that there were in Malabar a few <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, but they were of little worth; he also says that "the inhabitants persecute much the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>." (Yule, "Cathay and the Way Thither," I)

<p>The next visitor is <a href="../cathen/12217a.htm">Marco Polo</a>, who on his return from <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> (c. 1293) touched the <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> of St. Thomas. Of his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> he tells us: "The body Of Messer Saint Thomas the Apostle lies in the province of Malabar, at a certain little town having no great population; 'tis a place where few traders go . . . Both <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> however greatly frequent it in <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> also hold the Saint in great reverence....The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who go in <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> take some of the earth from the place where the Saint was killed and give a portion thereof to any who is sick, and by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of St. Thomas the sick man is incontinently cured. . . . The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>," he resumes later, "who have charge of the church have a great number of Indian nut trees [coconuts], and thereby get their living" (<a href="../cathen/12217a.htm">Marco Polo</a>, Yule's, 2nd edit., II, 338). Friar Jordan, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, came to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> as a missionary in 1321; he then had as companions four <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, but on approaching <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> he had parted from them to make diversion; in the meanwhile the vessel conveying the others was by stress of weather compelled to enter Tana, a port on the west coast, where the Khasi of the place <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put them to death</a> as they would not embrace <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>; the feast of Blessed Thomas of Tolentino and his companions is fixed on 6 April in the "Martyrologium Romanum". Later Jordanus, hearing what had happened, rescued their bodies and gave them burial. He must then have gone back to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, for he is next heard of in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1330, when <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12610a.htm">Quilon</a>. He left for the East the same year with two letters from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, one to the chief of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/12610a.htm">Quilon</a> and the other to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> at Molephatam, a town on the Gulf of Manaar. In the first the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> beseeches "that divisions cease and clouds of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> stain not the brightness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of all generated by the waters of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> . . . and that the phantom of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and wilful blindness of unsullied <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> darken not the vision of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ and adore His name."

<p>Much the same in other words is repeated in the second letter, and they are urged to unity with the Holy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> recommends the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to the kindness of the people, and thanks them for that shown to the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> who are working among them. All we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> is that Bishop Jordanus was sent out with these letters, but nothing further is heard of him. He wrote a small book named "Mirabilia", edited by Col. A. Yule for the Hakluyt Society, published in 1863 (see also "Cathay", I, 184). The next visitor is Blessed Oderic of Pordenone, who about 1324-25 landed at Tana, recovered the bodies of the four <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, Thomas and his companions who had there suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and conveyed them to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. On his way he halted at <a href="../cathen/12610a.htm">Quilon</a>, which he calls <em>Palumbum</em>; thence he took passage on a Chinese junk for a certain city called Zayton in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. He mentions the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> at <a href="../cathen/12610a.htm">Quilon</a>, and that at Mylapore there were fourteen houses of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> ("Cathay", I, 57). A few years later Giovanni de Marignolli, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> delegate to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, arrived at <a href="../cathen/12610a.htm">Quilon</a>. He stayed there at a church dedicated to <a href="../cathen/06453a.htm">St. George</a>, belonging to the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>, and he adorned it with fine <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> and taught there the Holy Law. After dwelling there for upwards of a year he sailed to visit the shrine of the Apostle; he calls the town <em>Mirapolis</em>. After describing the culture of pepper on the coast he adds: "the pepper does not grow in forests but in gardens prepared for the purpose; nor are the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> the proprietors, but the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of St. Thomas, and these are the masters of the public weighing-office" [customs office]. Before leaving Quilon he erected a monument to commemorate his visit, and this was a marble pillar with a stone cross on it, intended to last, as he says, till the world's end. "It had the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> arms" he says, "and my own engraved on it, with an inscription both in Indian and Latin characters. I <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and blessed it in the presence of an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> multitude of people." The monument stood there till late in the nineteenth century when by the gradual erosion of the coast it fell into the sea and disappeared. He concludes his narrative by saying that after staying a year and four months he took leave of the brethren, i.e. the missionaries who were working in that field.

<h2 id="xii">Their two last Syrian bishops</h2>

<p>The two last Syrian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were Mar Joseph Sulaka and Mar Abraham; both arrived in Malabar after the arrival of the Portuguese. Their case presents two questions for discussion; were they canonically appointed, and had they completely rejected <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>? As to the first there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that his appointment was canonical, for he, the brother of the first Chaldean patriarch, was appointed by his successor Abed Jesu and sent out to <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a>, and both the above <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> had their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Malabar confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Mar Joseph was sent to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> with letters of introduction from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to the Portuguese authorities; he was besides accompanied by Bishop Ambrose, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> commissary to the first patriarch, by his <em>socius</em> Father Anthony, and by Mar Elias Hormaz, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Diarbekir. They arrived at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> about 1563, and were detained at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> for eighteen months before being allowed to enter the diocese. Proceeding to Cochin they lost Bishop Ambrose; the others travelled through Malabar for two and a half years on foot, visiting every church and detached settlement. By the time they arrived at Angamale <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> broke out. Then Mar Elias, Anthony the <em>socius</em> of the deceased <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, and one of the two Syrian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who had accompanied them, left <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> to return; the other <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> remained with Archbishop Joseph Sulaka. For some time the new <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> got on well with the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries, in fact, they praised him for having introduced order, decorum, and propriety in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> services and all went harmoniously for some time. Later, friction arose because of his hindering the locally-ordained Syrians from saying mass and preaching and instructing his flock. Eventually an incident revealed that Mar Joseph had not dropped his <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, for it was reported to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a> that he had attempted to tamper with the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of some young boys in his service belonging to the <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Diocese of Cochin</a>. This came to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, through him to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, then to the viceroy; it was decided to remove and send him to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, to be dealt with by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>The following is the nature of the incident. Taking these youths apart, he instructed them that they should venerate the Blessed Virgin as the refuge of sinners, but were not to call her <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, as that was not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; but she should be styled Mother of Christ (Nestorius, refusing at the <a href="../cathen/05491a.htm">Council of Ephesus</a> the term <em>Theotokos</em> proposed by the council, substituted that of <em>Christokos</em>, which the Fathers refused to accept because under this designation he could cloak his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in Christ). Mar Joseph was sent to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>; arriving there he succeeded in securing the good will of the Queen, then regent for her young son; he <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> before Cardinal Henry, expressed repentance, and by order of the queen was sent back to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Gouvea tells us that as he continued to propagate his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> on his return he was again deported and Cardinal Henry reported his case to <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> sent a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> to Jorge, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 15 Jan., 1567, ordering him to make enqueries into the conduct and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>; in consequence of this the first <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial council</a> was held; the charges against Mar Joseph were found to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and he was sent to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> in 1568, thence to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he died shortly after his arrival.

<p>While the former was leaving <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> there arrived from Mesopotemia an imposter named Abraham, sent by Simeon the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Patriarch. he succeeded in entering Malabar undetected. At the appearance of another Chaldean who proclaimed himself a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the people were greatly delighted and received him with applause; he set about at once acting as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, holding episcopal functions, and conferring <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> and quietly established himself in the diocese. (Gouva, p. col. 2). Later the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> captured him and sent him to Portugual, but <em>en route</em> he escaped at <a href="../cathen/10610a.htm">Mozambique</a>, found his way back to Mesopotamia, and went straight to Mar Abed Jesu the Chaldean Patriarch, having realized from his Indian experience that unless he secured a <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> from him it would be difficult to establish himself in <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a>. He succeeded admirably in his devices, obtained <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, and a letter to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> from the patriarch. With this he proceeded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and while there at an audience with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> he disclosed his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> position (<a href="../cathen/08324a.htm">Du Jarric</a>, "Rer. Ind. Thesaur.", tom. III, lib. II, p. 69). He avowed to <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with his own lips that he had received holy orders invalidly. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> ordered the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13452a.htm">San Severino</a> to give him orders from <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> was sent to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> Abraham the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The facts were attested, both as to the lesser orders and the episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, by the original letters which were found in the archieves of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Angamale where he resided and where he had died.

<p><a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pope Pius IV</a> used great tact in handling this case. Abed Jesu must have taken Abraham to be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; he is supposed to have <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>, and professed the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and conferred on him episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had to consider the position in which the patriarch had been placed by the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> and <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of the man; the defects were supplied, and Abraham succeeded also in obtaining his <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> and creation as Archbishop Angamale from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, with letters to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 27 Feb., 1565. Such was the success of this daring man. On arrival at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> he was detained in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, but escaped and entered Malabar. His arrival was a surprise and a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to the people. He kept out of the reach of the Portuguese, living among the churches in the hilly parts of the country. As time passed on he was left in peaceful occupation. As is usual in such cases the old tendencies assumed once more their ascendency, and he returned to his <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> teaching and practices, Complaints were made; <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> sent warnings to Abraham to allow Catholic <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> to be preached and taught to his people. At one time he took the warning seriously to his heart. In 1583 Father Valignano, then Superior of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Missions, devised a means of forcing a reform. He persuaded Mar Abraham to assemble a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a>, and to convene the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the chiefs of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. He also prepared a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which was to be made publicly by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and all present. Moreover, urgent reforms were sanctioned and agreed to. A letter was sent by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Pope Gregory XIII</a>, 28 Nov., 1578, laying down what Abraham had to do for the improvement of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; after the above-mentioned synod Abraham sent a long letter to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in reply, specifying all that he had been able to do by the aid of the Fathers (see letter, pp. 97-99, in Giamil). This is called the first reconciliation of the Syrians to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It was formal and public, but left no improvement on the general body, the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> were not corrected nor was catholic teaching introduced in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>In 1595 Mar Abraham fell dangerously ill (<a href="../cathen/08324a.htm">Du Jarric</a>, tom. I, lib. II, p. 614). Unfortunately he survived the excellent sentiments he then had and recovered. After about two years, in 1597 (Gouva, p. 2) he was a second time again dangerously ill; Archbishop Aleixo de Menezes wrote and exhorted him to reform his people, but for answer he had only frivolous excuses. He would not even avail himself of the exhortations of the Fathers who surrounded his bed, nor did he receive the last <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Thus he died. The viceroy made known his death to Archbishop Menezes, then absent on a visitation tour, by letter of 6 Feb., 1597.

<h2 id="xiii">Archbishop Menezes and the Synod of Diamper</h2>

<p>Archbishop Menezes received the intelligence of the death of Mar Abraham while on a tour of pastoral visitation at Damao. Fearing the work on hand could not be postponed, he decided to act on the powers <a href="../cathen/04696b.htm">delegated</a> to him by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in his last <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, and nominated Father Francisco Roz of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> who undoubtly fulfilled the requirements demanded by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for the appointment. On receipt of the letter and the instructions accompanying it, the superior, knowing that the late Abraham before his death had assigned to his <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> the government of the church pending the arrival of another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from Babylon, and the same had been accepted by the people, and foreseeing also the insecurity of the position, decided that it would be prudent to await the return of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> before taking any further step. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> on returning to <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> weighed the gravity of the case, and felt bound in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> to safeguard the Syrian <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> from falling again into the hands of a new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> intruder. He decided on visiting the Serra personally. Father Nichol&aacute;o Pimenta, then the Superior of <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missions in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, writing the General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, Father Claudius Acquaviva, takes up the narrative as follows; "It was not small comfort to all that Alexious Menezes, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Lord Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, moved by his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and at our persuasion undertook to visit the ancient <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of St. Thomas, spread through the hilly parts of <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a>. There was great danger that after the death of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> Abraham at Angamale, and the succession of the Archdeacon George to the government of the church on the demise of the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, she would lapse again under the sway of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>; nor were there wanting <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rank possessed of means who proposed to proceed to Babylon and bring thence another <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>. To the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> not only by <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> right, but also in virtue of <a href="../cathen/01640a.htm">Apostolic letters</a> appertained the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to assume the administration of that Church <em>sede vacante</em>; and he took upon himself the task of retaining the vacillating <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> in due submission to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and avoiding <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>."

<p>He therefore issued instructions to the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the Vaipicotta College, enclosing a letter of appointment naming the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> provided he in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> made a solemn profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> expressed his satisfaction on receiving the intimation and promised to make the profession demanded on a <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a>. But later on he would neither make the profession, nor would he accept the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of administrator as coming from the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Afterwards he caused it to be reported that he had so acted on the advice of others. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, after taking counsel with the Fathers, decided on starting on the visitation of the Archdiocese of Angamale to induce that Church to receive a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> from the Sovereign Pontiff. On this coming to be known all sorts of difficulties were raised to induce him to abandon his project, even from <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, with such pertinacity that the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> wrote to Pimenta: "Heaven and earth have conspired against my design." But he manfully faced the work before him, and went through it with singular firmness of character and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and supported by Divine aid he began, continued, and completed the arduous task he had undertaken with complete success.

<p>During the visitation (full details of which are given by Gouvea in the "Jornada", the one source whence all other writers have obtained their information, some even going so far as entirely to distort the facts to satisfy their prejudice) the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> underwent all sorts of hardships, visiting the principal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, addressing the people, holding services, and everywhere conferring the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, of which these people were deprived. He caused the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> books in the possession of the churches and in the hands of the people to be expurgated of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, and they were then restored to their owners. All the books then existing among the Syrians were in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> form; printed books among them did not exist at this period. Passages that denied the Supreme authority of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were similarly deleted. He also caused capable <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to be sought out, and these he placed in charge of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. Eventually he established eighty <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. Thus he prepared his ground for the reform of this Church which he intended to carry out. The synod was opened with great solemnity and pomp on 20 June, 1599, at the village of Udiamparur, whence it is known as the Synod of Diamper. The Acts were published in Portuguese as an appendix to the "Jornada"; they were also translated into Latin. The opening Act the synod was the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> was the first to make his profession, then followed the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> who made in Malayalam, a translation of the former prepared for the purpose. Subsequently the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in turn made theirs in the hands of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> as the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> also had done. The Latin text of the synod, and separate in "Juris Pontificii de Propaganda Fide", <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. I, vol. VI, part II, p. 243. Besides the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and certain <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> who assisted him there were some 153 Syrian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and about 600 <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> deputed by the congregation to represent them; all these signed the decrees that were passed by the synod and proclaimed the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> embodied in the act of profession taken by the entire <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> addressed the synod on the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Nestorius up till then held by that Church, the assembly denounced them, <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Patriarch, and promised obedience and submission to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a>.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> spread against Menezes and the synod the most prominent is that all the Syriac books of the community were burnt and destroyed by order of the synod. What was done in this matter under the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> passed in the fifth session is thus described in the "Jornada" (tr. Glen, book I, ch. xxiii, p. 340). After the above condemnation of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> it was decided that certain books which had been named and were current in the serra and full of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> should be burnt; that others were to be censured only until they were corrected and expurgated. The list of books to be burnt is given in the 14th <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the third session. The books consist:<ul><li>of those <em>ex professo</em> teaching <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>; <li>containing <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> legends; <li>books of sorceries and <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> practices.</ul> None of these were capable of correction. In all other books that had any statements containing <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, the latter were erased. The "Jornada" (p. 365) gives the system adopted during the visitation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for the correction of books: after Mass was said all books written in Syriac, whether the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a> or of private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> were handed over to Father Francisco Roz, who with three <em>Cathanars</em> (Syrian priests) specially selected for the purpose would retire to the vestry and there correct the books in conformity with the directions given by the synod ; those that were condemned and forbidden were handed over to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, who would order them to be burnt publicly. Under his orders no book capable of being purged from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> would be destroyed, but those <em>ex professo</em> teaching <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> would be destroyed. After the conclusion of the synod Archbishop Menezes continued his visitation of the churches down to Quilon and then returned to <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>. He did not forget to send from thence a letter of warm thanks to Father Pimenta for the continuous and important aid given by the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> all through the work he had to perform in <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a>.

<h2 id="xiv">Their first three Jesuit bishops</h2>

<p>In making provisions for the future government of the Syrian Church in <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a>, <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> had to adopt such measures as would secure its permanency in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and exclude the danger of a relapse. He decided that it would be the safest course to appoint a Latin <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> in sympathy with the people and fully acquainted with their <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language. The selection fell on Father Roz, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> after hearing the opinion of Archbishop Menezes. Father Roz was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> under the title of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Angamale in 1601. Four years later <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> transferred him (1605) to the new See of Cranganore, which he created an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> in order that the faithful brought to unity should not feel that the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of their see had suffered any diminution of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> made a visitation tour through the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, correcting the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> at every church where this had not been done, and enforcing everywhere the rules sanctioned by the Synod of Diamper. In 1606 he convened and held a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod; no further details of his administration are handed down to us. After twenty-three years of strenuous episcopate he died at Parur, his ordinary residence, 18 February, 1624, and was buried in the church. Besides the Latin Canon of the Mass he had also translated the Latin ritual into Syriac for the administration of the Holy Sacraments by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Years later, on the occasion of the first pastoral visit of the first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Trichur to the church of Parur in 1888, on enquiring after the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, was told that no <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of his was known to exist there, but after careful search had been made the tombstone, with its Malayalam inscription in ancient Tamil characters, was found and is now affixed to the inner wall of the church. The loss of all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the tombstone was caused by the sacking and burning of this church with many others by the soldiers of Tippoo Sultan on his second invasion of the coast. Paulinus a Sancto Bartholomaeo, who had visited the church in 1785 and had taken a transcript of the inscription at the time, of which he gives a Latin translation in his "India Christ. Orient.", p. 64, did not read the name Roz on the stone, however the name is there in a flaw of the stone and has been read on rediscovery.

<p>Father Estev&atilde;o de Brito, also a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, was designated successor, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Bom Jesus, <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, on 29 Sept., 1624, and left <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> on 4 November. He died on 2 December, 1641, having governed the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> for over seventeen years. The third of the series was Francisco Garcia, of the same <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01766b.htm">Ascalon</a> on 1 November, 1637, with right of succession by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Church of Bom Jesus, <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, and succeeded to the See of Cranganore in 1641. Under this <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> a frightful <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> broke out (1653) and his entire flock, with all his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and churches, withdrew from his allegiance. Out of the entire body of 200,000 Syrian <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> only some 400 <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> remained faithful. This misfortune has by most writers been attributed to Garcia's want of tact, obstinancy, and sarcastic disposition: as to the latter defect there is one instance, and that at the last opportunity for reconciliation, which fell through owing to his harsh treatment of the delegates sent to him by his revolted flock. But he was not responsible for the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. This had been hatched many years previously during the lifetime of his predecessor de Brito, secretly and unknown to him. Here the dates only of documents can be quoted. On 1 January, 1628 the Archdeacon George wrote a letter to the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> complaining that no answer was given to a letter sent some twenty years earlier regarding the spiritual wants of this <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people. In 1630 <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was informed of these complaints, the substance of which was that only <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> controlled these <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, that they were unsuited, and had controlled them for over forty years, and they wanted other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders to be sent. The Sacred Congregation sent instructions that other orders should be admitted into the diocese.

<p>Paulinus (op. cit., pp. 70 sq.) adduces further evidence of the trickery and treachery of Archdeacon George. In 1632 he convened a meeting at Rapolin consisting of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, when a letter of complaint was sent to the King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>; these very same complaints formed the heads of their grievances in 1653, when open <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> was proclaimed to secure independence and oust the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. The plot had been hatched for a good number of years; it was begun by Archdeacon George (d. 1637) who was succeeded in office by a relative, another Thomas de Campo (Thoma Parambil) who in 1653 headed the revolt. After the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> had broken out the intruder Ahatalla, a Mesopotamian <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, was deported by the Portuguese, who took him by ship off Cochin and there lay at anchor. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, coming to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of the fact, threatened to storm the fort, which the governor had to man with his soldiers, while the ship sailed away to <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> during the night. The revolted seeing their last attempt to secure a Baghdad <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> frustrated, leaders and people took a solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> that they would never again submit to Archbishop Garcia. Finding themselves in this position they thought of calling to their aid the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Fathers who had visited Malabar but were then at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>. When <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> came to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the calamity which had befallen the Syrian community, he sent out (1656) the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, Fathers Jos&eacute; de Sebastiani and Vincente of St. Catherine, to work for the return to unity and to their <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of this revolted church. Later other <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Fathers joined in the good work. Within a year of their arrival (1657) the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> had succeeded in reconciling forty-four churches. Although Archdeacon George had remained obdurate, a relative of his, Chandy Perambil (Alexander de Campo) headed the return movement, but they would have nothing to do with Archbishop Garcia.

<h2 id="xv">The Carmelite period</h2>

<p>Under these circumstances Father Jos&eacute; de Sebastiani decided to return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and inform the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of the real difficulty which stood in the way of permanent reconciliation. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on learning the state of the case had Father Jos&eacute; <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and appointed him Commissary Apostolic for Malabar, with power to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> two other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, naming them <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>. Provided with these powers he returned to Malabar in 1861 and took up his work. By this time, Archbishop Garcia had been removed from the scene by death. Between 1661 and 1662 the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Friars under Bishop Jos&eacute; had reclaimed the large number of eighty-four churches, leaving to the leader of the revolt &#151; the aforesaid Archdeacon Thomas &#151; only thirty-two churches. Both these figures are of great importance for the subsequent history of the Malabar Syrians. The eighty-four churches and their congregations were the body from which all the Romo-Syrians have descended, while the other thirty-two represent the nucleus whence the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> and their subdivisions, Reformed Syrians, etc., have originated. In January, 1663, the political situation regarding these <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> was entirely changed. The <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> had arrived on the coast and had captured Cochin. The <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> power fell. The new masters expelled not only all the Portuguese <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> but also forced Bishop Jos&eacute; and his religious to leave the country. In this predicament the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> selected and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Chandy Perambil (Alexander de Campo) and made him a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> over the flock he was forced to leave.

<p>Before departing, however, he handed to the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> Government of <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a> a list of the eighty-four churches that were under his control and commended Bishop Chandy and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of these churches to his protection. This the governor undertook to fulfil. Though the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> did not trouble themselves about the Syrian <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, yet they would not permit any <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> or Portuguese <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> to reside in <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a>, although simultaneously with Bishop Jos&eacute; de Sebastiani, the other <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> missionaries had also to depart. However, they were not absent long, for eventually they returned by ones and twos and were not molested. Later, in 1673, they established themselves at <a href="../cathen/15345a.htm">Verapoly</a> and built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> there, having obtained the land rent-free from the Rajah of <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a>; it is yet the headquarters of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> in <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a>. One of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> fathers named Matthew even came into friendly relations with the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> Governor van Rheede, and aided him in compiling his voluminous work on local botany known as "Hortus Malabaricus." The <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> working among the Syrians under Bishop Chandy remained on good terms with him; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> died in 1676. Raphael, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the Cochin diocese, was selected to succeed the former, but he turned out a failure and died in 1695." The year following, Father Peter-Paul, a <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>, was created titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a>, and was appointed <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> for Malabar. With his arrival in 1678 there was a considerable improvement in the relations between the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> Government and the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Fathers. The Archbishop Peter-Paul was a prince of the House of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, and his mother was the sister of <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Pope Innocent XII</a>; before coming out to Malabar he had obtained a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> from the Government of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> authorizing the residence in Malabar of one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and twelve <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who had to be either <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, or <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgians</a>; but they were not admitted into <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a>.

<p>The French traveller Anquetil du Perron, who visited Malabar in 1758, offers the following statistics regarding the number of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> on the coast he had obtained from Bishop Florentius, the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Malabar. He tells us that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> believed the total number of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to amount to 200,000; of these 100,000 were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Syrians, another 50,000 were of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> ; both these were under his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, while the revolted Syrians who may be classed as <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>, were under Mar Thomas VI (who on his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> in 1772 assumed the name and style of Dionysius I), and numbered 50,000. From the death of Archbishop Garcia in 1659 the See of Cranganore had no resident <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> till 1701, when <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> appointed Jo&atilde;o Rebeiro, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>. When the latter assumed charge the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Vicar Apostolic, Angelus Francis, told his Syrian flock that his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> had ceased and they must now pass over to that of the new <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Cranganore. The Syrians refused to acknowledge the new <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and sent a petition to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> that they preferred to remain under the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, who had seventy-one churches in complete submission and eighteen in partial union (i.e., the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> was divided and part had submitted to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>), while only twenty-eight churches remained altogether separate. Pope Clement, after informing the King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> of the state of things, extended in 1709 the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Bishop Angelus over the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Cranganore and Cochin, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> assigned as a reason for doing so that the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> would not tolerate any Portuguese <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> in the country, and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> threatened rather to return to <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> than accept the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> sent out. For fuller particulars of this period the reader is referred to: G. T. Mackenzie, "History of Christianity in Travangore," in <em>Census Report of 1901</em>, Trivandrum; and Paulinus a Sancto Bartholomaeo, "India Orientalis Christ" (Rome, 1794).

<p>On the arrival of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> and the capture of Cranganore it became impossible for the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to retain the college at Vipicotta; they abandoned the place and removing to the interior beyond the reach of their enemies, opened a new college, at Ambalacad, whence they controlled their new missions on the east coast. Bishop Rebeiro returned there and carried on his work; eventually several of the Syrian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> went over to the succeeding <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Cranganore, and these <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> eventually lapsed under the control of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>. Bishop Rebeiro died at the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Ambalacad on 24 Sept., 1716, is buried in the church of Puttencherra and has a tombstone with an inscription in Portuguese. His successors fixed Puttencherra as their residence, and the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church became a pro-cathedral. The following particulars of their <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> and death are here recorded. Archbishop Rebeiro was succeeded by Antonio Carvallo Pimental also a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as the former had been at the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of Bom Jesus, <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> on 29 Feb., 1722, d. at Puttencherra on 6 March, 1752. Paulinus says of him: vir doctus et Malabarensibus gratus, qui eum nomine Budhi Metran, sapientis et eruditi praesulis compellebant." He has a tombstone with inscription. Jo&atilde;o Luiz Vasconcellos, also a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at Calicut by Bishop Clemente of <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a> in 1753 and d. at Puttencherra in 1756; the church contains his tombstone with inscription. Salvador Reis, the last of the series who resided in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, was also a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>; he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the same Bishop Clemente at Angengo on Feb., 1758, d. on 7 April, 1777, at Puttencherra and has his tombstone with inscription in the same church. Paulinus records of him "vir sanctimonia vitae praeclarus", he survived the suppression of his order. This closes the list of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who have governed the See of Cranganore.

<p>To complete the historical account of the Syrian Malabar Church, brief mention should also be made of the line of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who ruled over the schismatics who eventually became <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>, embracing that <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> through their <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>: Thomas I, proclaimed a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by those he had led (1653) into the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> after the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of the hands</a> of twelve <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> his followers and the placing on his head of a <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> and in his hand a <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">pastoral staff</a>. He continued obdurate and died a sudden death in 1673. Thomas II, brother of the former, proclaimed in 1674, died eight days later struck by lighting. Thomas III, nephew of the former, received the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> in 1676, a Jacobite. Thomas IV of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, succeeded in 1676 and died in 1686, a Jacobite. Thomas V, a nephew of the former, made every effort to obtain <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> but failed, d. in 1717, a Jacobite. Thomas VI received the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> from his dying uncle and the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> of twelve <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. He wrote to the Jacobite <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> to send <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Eventually the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> authorities helped him and obtained for him three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, on condition of his defraying the expenses. Three Jacobite <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> came out to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> in 1751, Mar Basil, Mar Gregory, and Mar John. The first named died a year after arrival; the second years later <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Mar Thomas VI a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1772, and he assumed the name of Dionysius I. The <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> authorities found great difficulty in obtaining payment for the expenses incurred; a suit was instituted against the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> in the Travancore Rajah's court in 1775 and payment of the amount twelve thousand pounds, was obtained. He died in 1808.

<p>For the long period between 1678 and 1886, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Syrians remained under the uninterrupted control of about fifteen <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Bishops as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>. During this period there had often arisen severe troubles which cannot here be detailed, quarrels between Syrian and <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, agitation against the control of some <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; over and above these the ordinary trials of controlling such a large, factious, and difficult body. There had also been two most serious <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> intrusions within this Syrian fold by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Chaldean <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who had come from Mesopotamia with the full connivance of the Chaldean Patriarch and against the express orders of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> had to face and surmount all these difficulties and the keep the flock in due submission to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> regime. Of the two intrusions, the first was that of the Chaldean Bishop Mar Roccos, who entered Malabar in 1861. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> denounced him to the faithful as an intruder, yet he met with a complacent reception in many of the churches, succeeded in stirring up the dormant hydra of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and caused a great agitation. Fortunately for the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> he was persuaded to return to Mesopotamia within the year. The second, who came to Malabar in 1874, caused much greater harm, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> effects of which seem to be permanent in the principal church of Trichur, though elsewhere in process of time those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> effects have been remedied. This was the Bishop Mellus, whom the patriarch had sent over in spite of the strict prohibition of the same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. It was only when after repeated admonitions, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had fixed a limit of the time after which should he continue refractory he would be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, that he yielded and sent Bishop Mellus instructions to return. When the troublesome character of these people is taken into consideration it reflects great credit on the carmelite Order that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in charge were successful in retaining them as a body in the unity of Holy Church.

<h2 id="xvi">Two Latin vicars apostolic</h2>

<p>The Mellusian <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, though broken by the adverse judgments of the Madras High Court, was by no means yet extinct when in the autumn of 1878 the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> decided on placing the Syrian <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> under separate administration, appointing two <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> for the purpose. These were Rev. A.E. Medlycott, Ph.D., Military Chaplain in the Punjab, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> College, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a> Mgr. A. Ajuti on 18 Dec., 1887, at Ootacamund, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15041b.htm">Tricomia</a>, appointed to the Vicariate Apostolic of Trichur; and the Rev. Charles Lavinge, S.J., former private secretary of the late <a href="../cathen/02382b.htm">Father Beckx</a>, General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> before coming out, appointed to the See of Kottayam, later called of Changanacherry. Under the Concordat of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> with the King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> an important advantage had been gained by the suppression of the Padroado <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> (Cranganore <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a>) over the Syrian churches. The first task the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had to face was to amalgamate in one harmonious whole the two sections of this Church, that which had been under the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> with that which had belonged to the Goan or Padroado <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, for the two had been for long years in open antagonism. This union fortunately was successfully effected. The other task was to establish something like a proper administration and control over the churches. This took longer time. The northern churches belonging to Trichur had not seen their <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> for perhaps a century, the two Chaldean <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had utilized the fact to their own advantage, and the troubles caused by them in these churches can easily be imagined; but with firmness and patience a fair working administration was introduced.

<p>The result may thus be briefly summed up. The <a href="../cathen/15041a.htm">Vicariate of Trichur</a> had a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Syrian population of 108,422 with eighty-three <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches and twenty-two chapels-of-ease, served by 118 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Syrian Rite, besides 23 Syrian <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Tertiary <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, in two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; there was also a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of 24 native Tertiary <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> with a middle-class <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of 33 girls. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on taking charge found that there is practically no <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, except that one provided for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>; he took early steps to open as many elementary <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> as possible; within nine years (1888-96) the vicariate was provided with no less than 231 elementary <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for both sexes, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educating</a> over 12,000 children, besides a high school (St. Thomas' College), with 95 students; there was also 56 boys in St. Aloysius's High School, under the Tertiary <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. A catechumenate was opened, where annually about 150 <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> converts were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; a fine building was under construction for a suitable residence, and plans were prepared to house the above college in a handsome structure. This was the condition of things when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> went to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> on sick leave. The <a href="../cathen/16050a.htm">Vicariate of Kottayam</a> had a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 150,000, with 108 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches and 50 dependent <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, served by a numerous <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of over 300 priests; it had 35 Tertiary <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> besides <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, in five <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; also three <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of native Tertiary <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educating</a> girls, two <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> under Tertiary Sisters of St. Francis, four catechumenates, two <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, with 96 students. The higher class <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> students of both vicariates attended the central Pontifical Seminary at Puttenpally. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> numbered 200, but the number of pupils was not published. There were three English Schools: Mananam, 60; Campalam, 80; and another with 20 students.

<p>In 1895 both <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> happened to be absent on leave. During this period the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> decided on a change of regime, yielding to the wishes of the people to grant them native <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<h2 id="xvii">Divided into three vicariates with native bishops</h2>

<p>The two vicariates described above were split into three, and they were styled Trichur, Ernaculam, Changanacherry; the new vicariate was formed of the southern portion of Changanacherry. The changes were carried out under <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 28 July, 1896, "Quae Rei Sacrae". Rev. John Menacherry, as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11475a.htm">Paralus</a>, was appointed to Trichur. Rev. Aloysius Pareparampil, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tio, was appointed to Ernaculam, and Rev. Mathew Makil, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15016c.htm">Tralles</a>, was appointed to Changanacherry; all three received <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> from the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a> Mgr. Zaleski, at <a href="../cathen/08596b.htm">Kandy</a> on 15 Oct., 1896.

<p>At the time of these changes, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> returns of these three vicariates (1911) gave: <ul><li>Trichur: <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, 91,064; children being <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>, 19,092; <li>Ernaculam: <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, 94,357; children being <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>, 9950; <li>Changanacherry: <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, 134,791; children being <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>, 2844. </ul>

<p>The future of this people depends very largely on <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> for their welfare and technical training for their development.
