<h1>St. Thomas of Hereford</h1>  

<p>(THOMAS DE CANTELUPE).

<p>Born at Hambledon, Buckinghamshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, about 1218; died at <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 25 August, 1282. He was the son of William de Cantelupe and Millicent de Gournay, and thus a member of an illustrious and influential <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> under the care of his uncle, Walter de Cantelupe, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, first at Oxford then at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. During his studies he attended the Council of Lyons in 1245, when he became a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>. Returning to <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, he taught canon law, and in 1262 was elected chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. In the Barons' Wars he took the popular side and stated the Barons' case before St. Louis at <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, 1263. After the defeat of Henry III at the battle of Lewes he was made chancellor of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (22 February, 1265), gaining wide renown for his judicial wisdom and fairness. Deprived of the chancellorshp on the death of Simon de Montfort, he went into exile, lecturing at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and Scripture (1265-72). He then resumed teaching at Oxford till 1274 when he attended the second Council of Lyons. He held several <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> which he administered most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a>, appointing responsible vicars, visiting them regularly, and showing himself a model <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> by his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and wide charity. In June, 1275, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by his friend <a href="../cathen/08644a.htm">Cardinal Kilwardby</a> (8 September, 1275). As <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> he continued his apostolic life, labouring incessantly for the good of his people, maintaining the privileges and <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> against Gilbert of Gloucester, Llewellyn, and others, supporting Edward I in his struggle with Llewellyn, combating the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> practices of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and reforming the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a>. He came into conflict with Archbishop Peckham on questions of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and at the Council of Reading (July, 1279) led the resistance of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to the policy of Peckham. (For the articles embodying the points in dispute see Wilkins, "Concilia", II, 75.) His personal differences with Peckham led first to his withdrawal to Normandy that he might avoid an <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> and appeal to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and subsequently in 1282 to his actual <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. He then went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to plead his own cause before <a href="../cathen/09724a.htm">Pope Martin IV</a>, who received him kindly. But his failing health succumbed to the fatigue of the journey and the summer heat. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> at <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>, but subsequently his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were brought back to <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a>, where many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were wrought by his intercession and his shrine became second only to that of <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas of Canterbury</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> (17 April, 1320), and his festival, formerly observed on 2 October, is now kept in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> on 3 October.
