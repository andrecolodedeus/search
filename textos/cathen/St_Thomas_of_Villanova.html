<h1>St. Thomas of Villanova</h1>  

<p>Educator, philanthropist, born at Fuentellana, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 1488; died at <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a>, 8 September, 1555. Son of Aloazo Tomas Garcia and Lucia Mart&iacute;nez Castellanos, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was brought up in the practices of religion and charity. Every Friday his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> was wont to give in <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> all the meal he earned at the mill, besides his usual daily dole of bread. On great feast-days he added wood, wine, and money; while to poor farmers he loaned money and seed. On the death of her husband, Lucia continued the usual <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and supplied indigent maidens in the neighbourhood with clothing and money. When sixteen tears old, Thomas entered the <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">University of Alcal&aacute;</a>, where, after proceeding <a href="../cathen/01759a.htm">master of arts</a> and licentiate in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, he filled the chair (1514) of arts, <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Among his auditors were the famed scholars Ferdinand de Encina and Dominic Soto. With Alcal&aacute;, however, ended his <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> associations, he having declined the chair of natural philosophy at Salamanca, where he joined the Augustinians in 1516, his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> following a year later, and his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> the year after; his first <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated at <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, 1518. At Salamanca Convent Thomas was given the class of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic theology</a> because of his attachment for books, chiefly the Lombard and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, and his exemplary life. Preaching in the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpits</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> was soon added to his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, among other places at <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a>, the field of his later trials, and Valladolid, seat of the imperial Court and residence of the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a> when on his visits to the Low Countries. In this last-named city St. Thomas was named by the emperor his court preacher, and one of his councillors of state. Rarely, however, did the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> pay visits of <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> to the then master of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, though his written correspondence with Charles, who held his opinions in high esteem, was voluminous. Towards the close of his life, while at <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a>, he had all the emperor's letters destroyed; his own letters to the emperor, however, are now stored at Simancas.

<p>Apart from these burdens Thomas held many offices of trust in his order, e.g. as <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> prior in various cities, among others at Valladolid in 1544, the very year he was called to the See of Valencia. Moreover, he was twice provincial-prior, first of <a href="../cathen/01465b.htm">Andalusia</a> and Castile in 1527, then six years later of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a> alone, whence the first mission band of his brethren was sent across the Atlantic in 1533 to establish houses of their order in Mexico. On 5 Aug., 1544, he received his <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> to the Archbishopric of Valencia, a post that for well-nigh a hundred years had witnessed no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in residence, an appointment that was confirmed by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>. Previously St. Thomas had declined the <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">See of Granada</a>, offered him by the emperor, while that of Valencia he accepted only through obedience to his superiors. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the church of his order at Valladolid by Juan, Cardinal Tavera de Pardo, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo. On his entrance to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> on 1 Jan., 1545, of which he was thirty-second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and eighth <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, St. Thomas opened his career as legislator and philanthropist, which won for him the titles of "Almsgiver", "Father of the Poor", and "Model of Bishops", given him at his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> in 1618 by <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>. During his eleven years of episcopal rule his most noteworthy deeds were as follows: a visitation of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, opened a few weeks after entrance into his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Among other amendments he inhibited his visitators from accepting any gifts whatever. He then held a synod, the first at Valencia for many years, whereby he sought to do away with a number of abuses, as bloodshed, <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a>, and many excessive privileges or unreasonable exemptions; he abolished the underground <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a>; rebuilt the general <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at Valencia which had just been destroyed by fire; founded two colleges, one for young <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, the other for poor students; laboured for the conversion of the <em>nuevos Cristianos</em>, whose profession of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was largely mere outward show; established a creche near his palace for foundlings and the offspring of indigent <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; had Mass said at early hours for the working-classes; and in brief, by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, by preaching, and by example, strove to reform the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> of churchman and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>.

<p>Towards the poor especially his heart was ever alive with pity; to them his palace gate was always open; daily he had a repast for every poor <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> that applied for help, as many even as four to five hundred thus getting their meals at his hands. In every district of the city he had almoners appointed with orders especially to search out the respectable <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who shrank from asking <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>; these he had supplied with money, food, clothing, while as to indigent workmen, poor farmers, and mechanics, he replenished their stock and brought them tools, thus putting them in the way of making a living. His whole life as replete with acts of practical kindness. He spent his spare time chiefly in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and study; his table was one of simple fare, with no luxuries. His dress was inexpensive; he mended with his own hands whatever needed repairs. Numberless are the instances of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas'</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">supernatural gifts</a>, of his power of healing the sick, of multiplication of food, of redressing grievances, of his <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasies</a>, of his conversions of sinners. He was taken ill in August, 1555, of angina pectoris, of which he died at the age of 67, at the termination of Mass in his bedroom. His last words were the versicles: "In manus tuas, Domine", etc.; his remains were entombed at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> Church of Our Lady of Help of his order outside the city walls, whence later they were brought to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The saint was of well-knit frame, of medium height, with dark complexion, brilliant eyes, ruddy cheeks, and Roman nose. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> (7 Oct., 1618), who set his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast-day</a> for 18 Sept., and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> on 1 Nov., 1658.

<p>Various reasons are given to account for St. Thomas' non-appearance at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, among them that he was ill, unable to stand the fatigue of travel; that his people would not brook his absence; and that the emperor was unable to do without his aid at home. The writings of St. Thomas, mainly sermons, are replete with practical norms of mystic <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. Some twenty editions have been published, the best and most complete being probably that of <a href="../cathen/09597b.htm">Manila</a>, 1882-1884, in 5 tomes.
