<h1>St. Ubaldus</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/04215a.htm">Confessor</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">Gubbio</a>, born of noble <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> at <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">Gubbio</a>, Umbria, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, towards the beginning of the twelfth centry; died there, <a href="../cathen/15614b.htm">Whitsuntide</a>, 1168.

<p>Whilst still very young, having lost his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> of his native city, where he also became a canon regular. Wishing to serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with more regularity he passed to the Monastery of St. Secondo in the same city, where he remained for some years. Recalled by his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he returned to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> monastery, where he was made prior. Having heard that at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> Blessed Peter de Honestis some years before had established a very fervent community of canons regular, to whom he had given special <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> which had been approved by Paschal II, Ubaldus went there, remaining with his brother canons for three months, to learn the details and the practice of their rules, wishing to introduce them among his own canons of <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">Gubbio</a>. This he did at his return. Serving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in great regularity, poverty (for all his rich patrimony he had given to the poor and to the restoration of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>), <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, meekness, and fervour, the fame of his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> spread in the country, and several <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> were offered to him, but he refused them all. However, the episcopal <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">See of Gubbio</a> becoming vacant, he was sent, with some <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, by the population to ask for a new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from Honorius II who, having <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him, sent him back to <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">Gubbio</a>. To his people he became a perfect pattern of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">Christian virtues</a>, and a powerful protector in all their spiritual and temporal needs. He died full of merits, after a long and painful illness of two years. Numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were wrought by him in life and after death. At the solicitation of Bishop Bentivoglio <a href="../cathen/03478b.htm">Pope Celestine III</a> <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> him in 1192. His power, as we read in the Office for his feast, is chiefly manifested over the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> are instructed to have recourse to him "contra omnes diabolicas nequitias".

<p>The life of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was written by Blessed Theobaldus, his immediate successor in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>, and from this source is derived all the information given by his numerous biographers. The body of the holy man, which had at first been buried in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> by the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> and Cagli, at the time of his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> was found flexible and incorrupt, and was then placed in a small oratory on the top of the hill overlooking the city, where in 1508, at the wish of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, the canons regular built a beautiful church, frequented to this day by numerous <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, who come to visit the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of their heavenly protector from near and far. The devotion to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> is very popular throughout Umbria, but especially at <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">Gubbio</a>, where in every <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> at least one member is called Ubaldus. The <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of their <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> is celebrated by the inhabitants of the country round with great solemnity, there being religious and civil processions which call to mind the famous festivities of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>.
