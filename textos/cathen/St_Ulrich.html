<h1>St. Ulrich</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, born at Kyburg, <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, in 890; died at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, 4 July, 973. He was the son of Count Hucpald and Thetbirga, and was connected with the dukes of Alamannia and the imperial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Ottos. As a child he was sickly; when old enough to learn he was sent to the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of St. Gall, where he proved to be an excellent scholar. He resolved to enter the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, but was in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether to enter the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of St. Gall or to become a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a>. He was sent before April, 910, for his further training to Adalbero, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, who made him a chamberlain. On Adalbero's death (28 April, 910) Ulrich returned home, where he remained until the death of Bishop Hiltine (28 November, 923). Through the influence of his uncle, Duke Burchard of Alamannia, and other relatives, Ulrich was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> by King Henry, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 28 Dec., 923. He proved himself to be a ruler who united severity with gentleness. He sought to improve the low moral and social condition of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and to enforce a rigid adherence to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Ulrich hoped to gain this end by periodical visitations, and by building as many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> as possible, to make the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> of religion more accessible to the common people. His success was largely due to the good example he set his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and diocese. For the purpose of obtaining <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> he went on two journeys to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in 910, and in 952 or 953.

<p>Ulrich demanded a high moral standard of himself and others. A hundred years after his death, a letter apparently written by him, which opposed <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a>, and supported the marriage of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, suddenly appeared. The <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forger</a> of the letter counted on the opinion of the common people, who would regard <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> as <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> if St. Ulrich, known for the rigidity of his <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, upheld the marriage of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (cf. "Analecta Boll.", XXVII, 1908, 474). Ulrich was also steadfastly loyal, as a prince of the empire, to the emperor. He was one of the most important props of the Ottonian policy, which rested mainly upon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> princes. He constantly attended the judicial courts held by the king and in the diets. He even took part in the Diet held on 20 September, 972, when he defended himself against the charge of nepotism in regard to his nephew Adalbero, whom he had appointed his coadjutor on account of his own illness and desire to retire to a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. During the struggle between <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a> and his son Duke Ludolf of Swabia, Ulrich had much to suffer from Ludolf and his partisans. When in the summer of 954 father and son were ready to attack each other at Illertissen in Swabia, at the last moment Ulrich and Bishop Hartbert of <a href="../cathen/03743b.htm">Chur</a> were able to mediate between Otto and Ludolf. Ulrich succeeded in persuading Ludolf and Konrad, Otto's son-in-law, to ask the king's pardon on 17 December, 954. Before long the Magyars entered <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, plundering and burning as they went, and advanced as far as Augsburg, which they besieged with the fury of barbarians. It was due to Ulrich's ability and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> that <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> was able to hold out against the besiegers until the Emperor Otto arrived. On 10 August, 955, a battle was fought in the Lechfeld, and the invaders were finally defeated. The later assertion that Ulrich himself took part in the battle is incorrect, as Ulrich could not have broken through the ranks of the Magyars, who were south of him, although north of the emperor.

<p>As morning dawned on 4 July, 973, Ulrich had ashes strewn on the ground in the shape of a cross; the cross sprinkled with <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>, and he was placed upon it. His nephew Richwin came with a message and greeting from the Emperor <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a> as the sun rose, and immediately upon this, while the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> sang the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">Litany</a>, St. Ulrich passed away. His body was placed in the Church of St. Afra, which had been rebuilt by him. The burial was performed by Bishop Wolfgang of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. Many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were wrought at his grave; and in 993, he was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/08427c.htm">John XV</a>. As early as the tenth century, there is a very beautiful miniature, in a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> now in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a> (no. 261, fol. 140). Other miniatures are at the Royal Library of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of 1454 (Cgm., 94, fo. 26v, and Cgm., no. 751).
