<h1>St. Ulrich of Zell</h1>  

<p>(Wulderic; called also of Cluny, and of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>), born at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, at the beginning of 1029; died at Zell, probably on 10 July, 1093. Feast, 14 July (10). Two lives of him are extant: the first, written anonymously c. 1109 by a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Zell at the request of Adalbert, a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluse</a> near <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>; the other, also anonymous, written between 1109 and 1130. Particulars of his life are also contained in his writings. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and rich, were Bernhold and Bucca, niece of Bishop Gebhard II. Ulrich probably received his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a>, but in 1044 he was called to the court of his godfather, Henry IV, and acted as page to the Empress Agnes. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> by his uncle Nidger, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Freising, he was made <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. On his return from a journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he distributed his possessions to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the Holy Land, and, after another short visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, entered the Abbey of Cluny in 1061, during the reign of St. Hugo. Here he soon excelled in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and diligence, made his profession, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and appointed confessor to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Mareigny in the <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Diocese of Autun</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the community of men in the same place. Here he lost an eye and was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to return to Cluny.

<p>He was then named prior at Peterlingen (Payerne) in the Diocese of Lausanne, but on account of troubles caused by Bishop Burchard von Oltingen, a partisan of Henry IV, Ulrich again went to Cluny, where he acted as adviser to his <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. A nobleman had donated to Cluny some <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> at Gr&uuml;ningen near Breisach, and Ulrich was sent to inspect the place and eventually to lay the foundation of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Not finding the locality suitable, he with his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in 1087 retired to Zell (Sell, Sella, Villmarszelle) in the Black Forest, where the report of his virtues soon brought him many disciples. He enjoyed the esteem of <a href="../cathen/06402a.htm">Blessed Gebhard III</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Basle, who frequently visited him. In 1090 he established a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> for <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> at Bolesweiler (now Bollschweil), about a mile from Zell. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> granted him the <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">gift of miracles</a>. The last two years of his life he was blind. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, but three years later his body was brought into the church. His feast was celebrated for the first time 14 July, 1139.

<p>His life of Hermann von Z&auml;hringen, Margrave of Baden, later a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Cluny, is also lost. His "Consuetudines cluniacenses" (in P.L., CXLIX, 657) were composed at the request of William, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Hirschau, in three books. The first two, written between 1079 and 1082, treat of liturgy and the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>; the third, written not later than 1087, speaks of the government of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>.
