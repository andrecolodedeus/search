<h1>St. Valentine</h1>  

<p>At least three different Saint Valentines, all of them <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, are mentioned in the early <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> under <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of 14 February. One is described as a <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, another as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Interamna (modern <a href="../cathen/10704a.htm">Terni</a>), and these two seem both to have suffered in the second half of the third century and to have been buried on the Flaminian Way, but at different distances from the city. In <a href="../cathen/15633d.htm">William of Malmesbury's</a> time what was known to the ancients as the Flaminian Gate of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and is now the Porta del Popolo, was called the Gate of St. Valentine. The name seems to have been taken from a small church dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> which was in the immediate neighborhood. Of both these St. Valentines some sort of <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm"><em>Acta</em></a> are preserved but they are of relatively late date and of no historical value. Of the third Saint Valentine, who suffered in Africa with a number of companions, nothing further is known.
<h2>Saint Valentine's Day</h2>

<p>The popular customs associated with Saint Valentine's Day undoubtedly had their origin in a conventional <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> generally received in <a href="../cathen/05431b.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, that on 14 February, i.e. half way through the second month of the year, the birds began to pair. Thus in <a href="../cathen/03642b.htm">Chaucer's</a> <em>Parliament of Foules</em> we read:</p>

<blockquote> <p>For this was sent on Seynt Valentyne's day <br>Whan every foul cometh ther to choose his mate. </p></blockquote>

<p>For this reason the day was looked upon as specially <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to lovers and as a proper occasion for writing <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> letters and sending lovers' tokens. Both the <a href="../cathen/06190a.htm">French</a> and <a href="../cathen/05458a.htm">English literatures</a> of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries contain allusions to the practice. Perhaps the earliest to be found is in the 34th and 35th <em>Ballades</em> of the bilingual poet, <a href="../cathen/06685a.htm">John Gower</a>, written in French; but Lydgate and Clauvowe supply other examples. Those who chose each other under these circumstances seem to have been called by each other their Valentines. In the <em>Paston Letters</em>, Dame Elizabeth Brews writes thus about a match she hopes to make for her daughter (we modernize the spelling), addressing the favoured suitor:

<blockquote><p>And, cousin mine, upon Monday is Saint Valentine's Day and every bird chooses himself a mate, and if it like you to come on Thursday night, and make provision that you may abide till then, I trust to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that ye shall speak to my husband and I shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that we may bring the matter to a conclusion. </p></blockquote>

<p>Shortly after the young lady herself wrote a letter to the same man addressing it "Unto my rightwell beloved Valentine, John Paston Esquire". The custom of choosing and sending valentines has of late years fallen into comparative desuetude.
