<h1>St. Vergilius of Salzburg</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> missionary and <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, of the eighth century. Vergilius (or Virgilius, in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <em>Fergal, Ferghil</em>, or <em>Feirghil</em>) is said to have been a descendant of Niall of the Nine Hostages. In the "Annals of the Four Masters" and the "Annals of Ulster" he is mentioned as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Aghaboe, in Queen's County. About 745 he left <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, intending to visit the Holy land, but, like many of his countrymen, who seemed to have adopted this practice as a work of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, he settled down in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where he was received with great favour by Pepin, then mayor of the Palace under Childeric III. After spending two years at Cressy, near Compiegne, he went to <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, at the invitation of Duke Otilo, and within a year or two was made <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Peter's at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>. Out of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, he "concealed his orders", and had a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> named Dobdagrecus, a fellow countryman, appointed to perform his episcopal functions for him. It was while <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Peter's that he came into collision with <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>. A <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> having, through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, conferred the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Sacrament of Baptism</a> using, in place of the correct formula, the words Baptizo te in nomine patria et filia et spiritu sancta", Vergilius held that the sacrament had been validly conferred. <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a> complained to Pope Zachary. The latter, however, decided in favour of Vergilius. Later on, <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> accused Vergilius of teaching a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in regard to the rotundity of the earth, which was "contrary to the Scriptures". Pope Zachary's decision in this case was that "if it be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that he held the said <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, a council be held, and Vergilius expelled from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and deprived of his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dignity" (Jaffe, "Biblioth. rerum germ.", III, 191). Unfortunately we no longer possess the treatise in which Vergilius expounded his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. Two things, however, are certain: first, that there was involved the problem of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> and the universality of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>; secondly, that Vergilius succeeded in freeing himself from the charge of teaching a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> contrary to Scripture. It is likely that <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a> misunderstood him, taking it for granted, perhaps, that if there are antipodes, the "other race of men" are not descendants of Adam and were not redeemed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Vergilius, no doubt, had little difficulty in showing that his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> did not involve consequences of that kind. (See <a href="../cathen/01581a.htm">ANTIPODES</a>.)

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, Vergilius was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> (766 or 767) and laboured successfully for the upbuilding of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> as well as for the spread of the Faith in neighbouring <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> countries, especially in Carinthia. He died at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, 27 November, 789. In 1233 he was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>. His <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that the earth is a sphere was derived from the teaching of ancient geographers, and his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the existence of the antipodes was probably influenced by the accounts which the ancient <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> voyagers gave of their journeys. This, at least, is the opinion of Rettberg ("Kirchengesch. Deutschlands", II, 236).
