<h1>St. Veronica</h1>  

<p>In several regions of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> there is honored under this name a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> matron of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> who, during the Passion of Christ, as one of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who accompanied Him to <a href="../cathen/03191a.htm">Calvary</a>, offered Him a towel on which he left the imprint of His face. She went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, bringing with her this image of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which was long exposed to public veneration. To her likewise are traced other <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in several churches of the West. The <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the existence of authentic images of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is connected with the old legend of <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar of Edessa</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> writing known as the "Mors Pilati". To distinguish at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the oldest and best known of these images it was called <em>vera icon</em> (<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> image), which ordinary language soon made <em>veronica.</em> It is thus designated in several <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> texts mentioned by the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> (e.g. an old <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> has a Mass "De S. Veronica seu Vultus Domini"), and <a href="../cathen/15597a.htm">Matthew of Westminster</a> speaks of the imprint of the image of the Savior which is called Veronica: "Effigies Domenici vultus quae Veronica nuncupatur". By degrees, popular <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> mistook this word for the name of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and attached thereto several legends which vary according to the country.</p>

<ul><li>In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> Veronica comes to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at the summons of the <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Emperor Tiberius</a>, whom she cures by making him touch the sacred image. She thenceforth remains in the capitol of the empire, living there at the same time as Sts. <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and Paul, and at her death bequeaths the precious image to <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">Pope Clement</a> and his successors. <li>In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> she is given in marriage to Zacheus, the convert of the Gospel, accompanies him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and then to Quiercy, where her husband becomes a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>, under the name of Amadour, in the region now called Rocamadour. Meanwhile Veronica joins Martial, whom she assists in his apostolic preaching. <li>In the region of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> Veronica, shortly after the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension of Christ</a>, lands at Soulac at the mouth of the Gironde, bringing <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>; there she preaches, dies, and is buried in the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> which was long <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> either at Soulac or in the Church of St. Seurin at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>. Sometimes she has even been confounded with a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who, according to <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a>, brought to the neighboring town of Bazas some drops of the blood of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>, at whose beheading she was present. <li>In many places she is identified with the Haemorrhissa who was cured in the Gospel. </ul>

<p>These <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> traditions cannot be documented, but there is no reason why the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that such an act of compassion did occur should not find expression in the veneration paid to one called Veronica, even though the name has found no place in the Hieronymian Martyrology or the oldest historical Martyrologies, and <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> excluded the Office of St. Veronica from the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> where it had been introduced. The Roman Martyrology also records at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> St. Veronica de Binasco, the Order of St. Augustine, on 13 January, and <a href="../cathen/15363a.htm">St. Veronica Giuliani</a> on 9 July.</p>
