<h1>St. Vicelinus</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11237b.htm">Oldenburg</a>, apostle of Holstein, b. at Hameln about 1086; d. 12 Dec., 1154. <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">Orphaned</a> at an early age, he received his primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at Hameln. He left secretly for <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, where he enjoyed the home and instructions of Hartmann, and soon surpassed his companions and assisted in the management of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. He was called to Bremen to act as teacher and principal of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and was offered a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> by Archbishop Frederic. In 1122 he went to Laon in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to complete his studies (Hauck, "Kirchengesch. Deutschl.", Leipzig, 1903, IV, 600); this is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> by Schirren (Beitrage zur Kritik alterer holst. Geschichte, 1876, 38). On his return he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by St. Norbert of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>. Archbishop Adalben sent him among the Wends, and in the fall of 1126 Henry, Prince of the Obotrites, gave him a church in Lubeck. At the death of Henry (22 March, 1127) Vicelinus returned to <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, and was appointed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> at Wippenthorp. This gave him an opportunity to work among the Holstians and neighbouring <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>. His preaching gathered crowds of eager listeners, and many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> aided him in founding the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Neumunster, according to the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>, which was liberally endowed by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Wars among the tribes in 1137 caused the missionaries to abandon their labours for two years. Vicelinus sent two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to Lubeck, but with little success. At his suggestion King Lothair intended to build a fortress and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Segeburg, but death prevented him. Some years later Vicelinus established a house at Hogersdorf. In 1149 he was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11237b.htm">Oldenburg</a>, where he did much for the spiritual and temporal welfare of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In 1152 he was struck by paralysis and lingered amid much suffering for two years. His body was transferred to Bordesholm in 1332, and buried before the main altar. In 1874 the small <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> at Hameln had his picture engraved on a new bell. He is usually represented with a church resting on his left arm; his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 12 Dec.
