<h1>St. Vigilius</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, patron of <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> and of Tyrol, b. c. 353; d. 26 June, 405; feast 26 June. The name of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> was not known (Acta SS., June, VII, 143), though given by some as Theodosius. His mother Maxentia (Acta SS., Apr., III, 781) and his brothers Claudian (Acta SS., March, I, 426) and Magorian (Acta SS., March, II, 398) are numbered among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. At an early age he came with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> (possibly he was born there), and pursued his studies at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, becoming noted for his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and learning; here he seems to have formed a friendship with <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>. He went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and thence in 380 returned to <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, where the people by acclamation chose him their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Valerian, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, or possibly by <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose of Milan</a> who donated the episcopal insignia and showed a paternal solicitude for Vigilius; he urged him (Ep. 29 in P.L., XVI, 982) to strongly oppose marriages with <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>. Vigilius laboured strenuously to convert the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> in the city of <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> and the many <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolaters</a> throughout the diocese. He preached the Gospel in the districts of <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a> and <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, beyond the confines of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and there erected some thirty <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> placing his missionary companions as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Among these were Sts. Sisinnius, Martyrius, and Alexander (Acta SS., May, VII, 37), natives of Cappadocia, whom Vigilius had brought from <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and who after a short apostolate were <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a>; parts of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were sent to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and others to Constantinople.

<p>Accompanied by his brothers and a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> named Julian, Vigilius then went west of <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> to the Rendena Valley to teach the Gospel to the worshippers of Saturn. At a place, which is now the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Rendena, he offered the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a> and threw the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Saturn into the River Sarka. Enraged at this the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolaters</a> stoned him to death. The body was brought back to <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> and buried in the church built by Vigilius. The acts of his life and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> were immediately sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a> gave them to the <a href="../cathen/07460a.htm">Emperor Honorius</a> as a protection on one of his military expeditions. He seems to have made a formal <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>, for <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> ("De canonizat. SS.", <a href="../cathen/12117a.htm">Prato</a>, 1839, I, ch. iv, no. 12) calls Vigilius the first <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Eugippius, the successor of Vigilius in the <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">See of Trent</a>, enlarged the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and dedicated it to St. Vigilius. In 1386 the right hand was separated from the body and put into a precious <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a>. Many churches in Tyrol bear the name of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. He is the author of the work, "De Martyrio SS. Sisinnii, Martyrii et Alexandri", in P.L., XIII, 549.
