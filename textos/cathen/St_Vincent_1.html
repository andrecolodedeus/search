<h1>St. Vincent</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">Deacon</a> of Saragossa, and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, 304; mentioned in the Roman Martyrology, 22 Jan., with St. Anastasius the Persian, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by the Greeks, 11 Nov. This most renowned <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> is represented in the <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and has as emblems a cross, a raven, a grate, or a fire-pile. He is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as patron in <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a>, <a href="../cathen/13468c.htm">Saragossa</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> etc., is invoked by vintners, brickmakers, and sailors, and is in the <a href="../cathen/09291a.htm">Litany of the Saints</a>. His Acts were read in the churches of Africa at the end of the fourth century, as St. Augustine testifies in Sermon 275. The present Acts (Acta SS., III Jan., 6) date from the eighth or ninth century, and were compiled from tradition. Anal. Boll., I, 259, gives another life. All agree in substance with the metric life by Prudentius (P.L., LX, 378). He was born at <a href="../cathen/13468c.htm">Saragossa</a>; his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> was Eutricius (Euthicius), and his mother, Enola, a native of Osca. Under the direction of Valerius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sargossa, Vincent made great progress in his studies. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and commissioned to do the preaching in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> having an impediment of speech. By order of the Governor Dacian he and his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> were dragged in chains to Valencia and kept in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> for a long time. Then Valerius was banished, but Vincent was subjected to many cruel torments, the rack, the gridiron, and scourgings. He was again <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, in a cell strewn with potsherds. He was next placed in a soft and luxurious bed, to shake his constancy, but here he expired.

<p>His body was thrown to be devoured by vultures, but it was defended by a raven. Dacian had the body cast into the sea, but it came to shore and was buried by a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>. After peace was restored to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was built over the remains outside the walls of Valencia. In 1175 the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were brought to <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>; others claim that they came to Castres in 864. <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a>, and other cities claim to have <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. Childeric I brought the sole and <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a> to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 542, and built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Vincent, later called St-Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s. Regimont, near Bezi&egrave;res, had a church of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> as early as 455. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> had three churches dedicated to St. Vincent; one near St. Peter's, another in Trastevere, and the one built by Honorius I (625-38) and renewed by <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Leo III</a> in 796. A pilaster found in the basilica of <a href="../cathen/14207a.htm">Salona</a> in <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> shows an inscription of the fifth or sixth century in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> (Rom. Quartalschrift, 1907, Arch. 135).
