<h1>St. Vincent Ferrer</h1>  

<p>Famous <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> missionary, born at <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a>, 23 January, 1350; died at <a href="../cathen/15271b.htm">Vannes</a>, Brittany, 5 April, 1419. He was descended from the younger of two brothers who were knighted for their valour in the conquest of Valencia, 1238. In 1340 Vincent's father, William Ferrer, married Constantia Miguel, whose <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> had likewise been ennobled during the conquest of Valencia. Vincent was their fourth child. A brother, not unknown to history, was Boniface Ferrer, General of the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>, who was employed by the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> in important diplomatic missions. Vincent was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a>, and completed his philosophy at the age of fourteen. In 1367 he entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, and was sent to the house of studies at Barcelona the following year. In 1370 he taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at <a href="../cathen/09188a.htm">L&eacute;rida</a>; one of his pupils there was Pierre Fouloup, later Grand Inquisitor of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>. In 1373 Vincent returned to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> "Studium arabicum et hebraicum" at Barcelona. During his stay there famine was prevalent; filled with compassion for the sufferers; Vincent foretold, while preaching one day, the near approach of ships bearing wheat. His prediction was fulfilled. In 1377 he was sent to continue his studies at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, where, in his own words, "study followed <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> succeeded study". In 1379 Vincent was retained by <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Cardinal Pedro de Luna</a>, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of the Court of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, who was endeavouring to win King Peter IV to the obedience of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. The saint, thoroughly convinced of the legitimacy of the claims of the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pontiffs</a>, was one of their strongest champions. From 1385 to 1390 he taught <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Valencia.

<p>After this Vincent carried on his apostolic work while in <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Pedro de Luna's</a> suite. At Valladolid he converted a rabbi, later well known as Bishop <a href="../cathen/11588a.htm">Paul of Burgos</a>. At Salamanca Queen Yolanda of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> chose him for her confessor, 1391-5. About this time he was cited before the Inquisiton for preaching publicly "the Judas had done penance", but Pedro de Luna, recently raised to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chair as <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, cited the case before his tribunal and burned the papers. <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict</a> then called him to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> and appointed him confessor and Apostolic penitentiary. Notwithstanding the indifference of so many <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Court, he laboured <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> among the people. He steadfastly refused the honours, including the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>, which were offered to him. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> withdrew from the obedience of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> in September, 1398, and the troops of Charles VI laid siege to the city. An attack of fever at this time brought Vincent to death's door, but during an apparition of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> accompanied by <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> and St. Francis he was <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> cured and sent to preach penance and prepare men for the coming judgment. Not until November, 1399, did <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict</a> allow Vincent Ferrer to begin his apostolate, furnished with full powers of a <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> <em>a latere Christi.</em> For twenty years he traversed western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, preaching penance for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and preparation for judgment. Provence was the first field of his apostolate; he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to preach in squares and open places, such were the numbers that flocked to hear him. In 1401 he evangelized Dauphiny, <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, and the Alpine region, converting many Catharins and <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldensians</a>. Thence he penetrated into <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. While preaching at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> he singled out from among the hearers a youth who was destined to evangelize <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Bernadine of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>. Another chosen <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with whom Vincent came in contact while in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was <a href="../cathen/09655b.htm">Margaret of Savoy</a>. During the years 1403-4 <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, and Lyons received the missionary. He was followed by an army of penitents drawn from every rank of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, who desired to remain under his guidance. Vincent was ever watchful of his disciples, and never did the breath of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> touch this strange assemblage, which numbered at times 10,000. <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, Northern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, all heard Vincent in turn. It would be difficult to understand how he could make himself understood by the many nationalities he evangelized, as he could speak only Limousin, the language of Valencia. Many of his biographers hold that he was endowed with the gift of tongues, an opinion supported by Nicholas Clemangis, a doctor of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, who had heard him preach.

<p>In 1408 Vincent was at <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> consoling the plague-stricken. A meeting had been arranged there between <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> and <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> in the hope of putting an end to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. Vincent again urged <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict</a> to have pity on the afflicted Church, but in vain. Disappointed, he returned to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. It would be difficult to overestimate the influence which he exercised in the Iberian peninsula. Castile, <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a>, Murcia, <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a>, <a href="../cathen/01465b.htm">Andalusia</a>, and Asturias were visited in turn, and everywhere <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> marked his progress; <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a> were all lost in admiration of the thaumaturgus. From 1408 until 1416 he worked almost continuously south of the Pyrenees. At different times in Spanish history strenuous attempts had been made to convert the Jewish people, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> or spoliation being the alternatives offered to them. This state of affairs existed when Vincent began to work among them; multitudes were won over by his preaching. Ranzano, his first biographer, estimates the number of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> converted at 25,000. In the <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Kingdom of Granada</a> he converted thousands of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>. Vincent was often called upon to aid his country in temporal affairs, as the counsellor of kings and at one time the arbiter of the destiny of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In 1409 he was commissioned by <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> to announce to Martin of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> the death of his only son and heir.

<p>After Martin's death, the representatives of the Kingdoms of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a>, and Catalonia appointed Vincent one of the judges to determine the succession to the Crown. At the judgment, known as the Compromise of Caspe, he took the leading part and helped to elect Ferdinand of Castile. Vincent was one of the most resolute and faithful adherents of <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, and by his word, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> he did much to strengthen <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict's</a> position. It was not until 1416, when pressed by Ferdinand, King of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, that he abandoned him. On 6 January, preaching at <a href="../cathen/11700b.htm">Perpignan</a>, he declared anew to the vast throng gathered around his <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> that <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> was the legitimate <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but that, since he would not resign to bring peace to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, Ferdinand had withdrawn his states from the obedience of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. This act must have caused Vincent much sorrow, for he was deeply attached to <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict</a>. Nevertheless, it was thought that Vincent was the only <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> sufficiently esteemed to announce such a step to the Spanish races. John Dominici was more fortunate in his attempts to pave the way for reunion, when he announced to the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> the resignation of <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>. Vincent did not go to the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>; he continued his apostolic journeys through <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and spent the last two years of his life in Brittany, where consciences without number were reformed and instructed in a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> way of life.

<p>Vincent felt that he was the messenger of penance sent to prepare men for the judgment. For twenty years he traversed Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> preaching penance and awakening the dormant consciences of sinners by his wondrous eloquence. His austere life was but the living expression of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. The floor was his usual bed; perpetually <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, he arose at two in the morning to chant the Office, celebrating Mass daily, afterwards preaching, sometimes three hours, and frequently working <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. After his midday meal he would tend the sick children; at eight o'clock he prepared his sermon for the following day. He usually travelled on foot, poorly clad. Among St. Vincent's writings are: De suppositionibus dialecticis"; "De natura universalis"; "De monderno ecclesiae schismate", a defence of the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> pontiffs; and "De vita spirituali". His "Sermons" were published at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> (1570), Augsburg (1729), and Lyons (1816); and his complete works at <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a> (1591). He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/03187a.htm">Calixtus III</a> at the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Church of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Sopra Minerva, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 3 June, 1455.
