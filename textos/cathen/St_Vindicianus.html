<h1>St. Vindicianus</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>-Arras, b. if tradition is to be believed, perhaps at Beaulaincourt, near Bapeaume, about 620; d. 2 March, probably between 693 and 712. This is the birthplace indicated in the documents dating much later than the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> death, but which claim to reproduce an ancient local tradition. Nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of his early years. On the death of St. Aubert, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>-Arras (about 668), Vindicianus was elected his successor. In any case he was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of this see in the reign of Thierry III of Neustria (about 673). The author of the "Gesta episcoporum Cameracensium", who is generally well informed, declares that he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the duration of the episcopate of Vindicianus. Legend has crept into the history of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but the following facts may be regarded as certain. In 673 Vindicianus supervised the translation of the body of St. Maxellende to Caudri. In the same year he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Honnecourt sur l'Escaut, which was given in 685 to <a href="../cathen/02522b.htm">St. Bertin</a>. In 675 he signed a charter of donation in favour of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at Maroilles, rendered illustrious by St. Humbert. In the same year he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the church at Hasnon. He was probably in relation with St. Arnaud of Tongres, since we find his signature to the latter's testament in 679. In 681 he claimed for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of possessing the body of St. L&eacute;ger, the unfortunate victim of the political strife which was then filling Neustria with blood, but he did not succeed, the remains of St. L&eacute;ger being confided to Ansoald, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>. His predecessor, St. Aubert, had founded the Monastery of St. Vaast, the building of which he had been unable to complete; Vindicianus finished it, apparently in 682, and placed it temporalities under the protection of Thierry III, who conferred numerous gifts on the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. In 685 a certain Hatta was placed at its head by Vindicianus. In the following year the latter dedicated the church at Hamaye, and acted at the exhumation of the bodies of Sts. Eusebia and Gertrude, who had been abbesses of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of that name.

<p>The events of his life after this date (686) are unknown. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> at Mont-St-Eloi. The region was ravaged by the Normans in the ninth century, and on more than one occasion the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> were in danger, until in 1030 Bishop Gerard of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> had his body removed to the episcopal city. After having been at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> and Arras, the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were returned to Mont-St-Eloi in 1453. After still further translations, especialy in 1598 and 1601, the body was finally placed in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a>.
