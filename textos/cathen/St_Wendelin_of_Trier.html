<h1>St. Wendelin of Trier</h1>  

<p>Born about 554; died probably in 617. His earliest biographies, two in Latin and two in German, did not appear until after 1417. Their narrative is the following: Wendelin was the son of a Scottish king; after a piously spent youth he secretly left his home on a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On his way back he settled as a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> in Westricht in the <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Diocese of Trier</a>. When a great landowner blamed him for his idle life he entered this lord's service as a herdsman. Later a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> this lord to allow him to return to his solitude. Wendelin then established a company of <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> from which sprang the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Tholey. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> about 597, according to the later legends. Tholey was apparently founded as a collegiate body about 630. It is difficult to say how far the later biographers are trustworthy. Wendelin was buried in his cell, and a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was built over the grave. The small town of St. Wendel grew up nearby. The saint's intercession was powerful in times of pestilence and contagious diseases among cattle. When in 1320 a pestilence was checked through the intercession of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, Archbishop Baldwin of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> had the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> rebuilt. Baldwin's successor, Boemund II, built the present beautiful <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a>, dedicated in 1360 and to which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were transferred; since 1506 they have rested in a stone sarcophagus. Wendelin is the <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of country people and herdsmen and is still <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. He is represented in art as a youth, or as a <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">bearded</a> man, with a shepherd's bag and a book in one hand and a shepherd's crook in the other; about him feed lambs, cattle, and swine, while a crown and a shield are placed at his feet. St. Wendelin is not mentioned in the Roman Martyrology, but his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is observed in the <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Diocese of Trier</a> on 22 October.
