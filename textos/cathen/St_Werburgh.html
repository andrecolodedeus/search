<h1>St. Werburgh</h1>  

<p>(WEREBURGA, WEREBURG, VERBOURG).

<p>Benedictine, patroness of <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>, <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Weedon, Trentham, Hanbury, Minster in Sheppy, and Ely, born in Staffordshire early in the seventh century; died at Trentham, 3 February, 699 or 700. Her mother was St. Ermenilda, daughter of Ercombert, King of Kent, and <a href="../cathen/13747b.htm">St. Sexburga</a>, and her father, Wulfhere, son of Penda the fiercest of the Mercian kings. St. Werburgh thus united in her veins the blood of two very different races: one fiercely cruel and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>; the other a type of gentle valour and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. In her, likewise, centred the royal blood of all the chief Saxon kings, while her father on the assassination of his elder brother Peada, who had been <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, succeeded to the largest kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/07241d.htm">heptarchy</a>. Whether Wulfhere was an obstinate <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> who delayed his promised conversion, or a relapsed <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, is controverted, but the legend of the terrible and unnatural crime which has been imputed to him by some writers must here be dismissed on the authority of all earlier and contemporary chroniclers, as the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> have pointed out. The <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, Sts. Wulfald and Ruffin, were not sons of Wulfhere and St. Ermenilda, nor victims of that king's tyranny. Ermenilda at once won the hearts of her subjects, and her <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> bore fruit in the conversion of many of them, while her influence on the passionate character of her husband changed him into a model <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> king. Werburgh inherited her mother's temperament and gifts. On account of her beauty and grace the princess was eagerly sought in marriage, chief among her suitors being Werebode, a headstrong warrior, to whom Wulfhere was much indebted; but the constancy of Werbrugh overcame all obstacles so that at length she obtained her father's consent to enter the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>, which had been founded by her great- aunt, St. Etheldra, and the fame of which was widespread.

<p>Wulfhere did not long survive his daughter's <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. On his death, St. Ermenilda took the veil at <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>, where she eventually succeeded her mother, <a href="../cathen/13747b.htm">St. Sexburga</a>, as <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>. <a href="../cathen/04092d.htm">Kenred</a>, Werburgh's brother, being a mere child at his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> death, his uncle Ethelred succeeded to the throne. This king invited St. Werburgh to assume the direction of all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> in his dominion, in order that she might bring them to that high level of discipline and perfection which had so often edified him at <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>. The saint with some difficulty consented to sacrifice the seclusion she prized, and undertook the work of reforming the existing Mercian <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and of founding new ones which King Ethelred generously endowed, namely, Trentham and Hanbury, in Staffordshire, and Weedon, in Northamptonshire. It had been the privilege of St. Werburgh to be trained by <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; at home by St. Chad (afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a>), and by her mother, and in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> by her aunt and grandmother. Her position worked no change in the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> which had always characterized her, so that in devotedness to all committed to her care she seemed rather the servant than the mistress. Her sole thought was to excel her sisters in the practice of religious perfection. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rewarded her childlike trust by many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, which have made St. Werburgh one of the best known and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> of the Saxon <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. That of the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">stolen</a> goose appealed most to the popular <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. The story, immortalized in the iconography of St. Werburgh, relates that by a simple command she banished a flock of wild geese that was working havoc in the cornfields of Weedon, and that since then none of these birds has been seen in those parts. She was also endowed with the gifts of prophecy and of reading the secrets of hearts. knowing how devoted her different communities were to her and how each would endeavour to secure the possession of her body after death, she determined to forestall such <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> rivalry by choosing Hanbury as her place of burial. But the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Trentham determined to keep the remains. They not only refused to deliver them to those who came from Hanbury, but they even locked up the coffin in a <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> and set a guard to watch it. The people of Hanbury sent out anew a large party to make good their claims. Reaching Trentham at midnight all the bolts and bars yielded at their touch, while the guards were overpowered by sleep and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not that the coffin was being carried to Hanbury.

<p>So numerous and marvellous were the cures worked at the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> that in 708 her body was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> translated to a more conspicuous place in the church, in the presence of her brother, <a href="../cathen/04092d.htm">Kenred</a>, who had now succeeded King Ethelred. In spite of having been nine years in the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, the body was intact. So great was the impression made on <a href="../cathen/04092d.htm">Kenred</a> that he resolved to resign his crown and followed in his sister's footsteps. In 875, through fear of the Danes and in order to show greater <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, the body was removed to <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>. The Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, on the site of the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>, was rededicated to St. Werburgh and St. Oswald, most probably in the reign of Athelstan. The great Leofric, Earl of Mercia (who was likewise styled Earl of <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>), and his wife, Lady Godiva, repaired and enlarged the church, and in 1093, Hugh Lupus, Earl of <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>, richly endowed the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and its church. By the instrumentality of this noble, <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>, which had been in the hands of secular canons, became a great <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, the name of <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, then a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at Bee, being associated with this transformation. They <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> possessed such immense influence and position that at the time of the suppression under <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> the Earl of Derby was the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot's</a> seneschal. In the vast wave of iconoclasm that swept over the country in that tyrant's reign the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was sacked by <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> who scattered St. Werburgh's <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. Fragments of the shrine were used as the base of an episcopal throne. Many of the labels and figures had been mutilated, and while restoring them the workmen by mistake placed <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> heads on male shoulders and vice versa. Only thirty of the original figures remain, four having been lost. Late all these fragments were removed to the west end of the south choir aisle, where they have been placed nearly in the original position of the shrine, which is 10 feet high. St. Werburgh's feast is celebrated 3 February.
