<h1>St. Wigbert</h1>  

<p>Companion of <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, born in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> about 675; died at <a href="../cathen/07296c.htm">Hersfeld</a> about 746. Positive biographical accounts of him are scanty; he had several contemporaries of the same name, and it is difficult to decide in all instances to which Wigbert the different details belong. In 836 <a href="../cathen/09436b.htm">Servatus Lupus</a> wrote a life of Wigbert, but this contains very few clear historical data while it relates in detail the purity of Wigbert's <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, charity, familiarity with the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, skill in teaching, enthusiasm for <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">monastic life</a>, and the faithfulness with which he fulfilled his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a> called him from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Wigbert was certainly older than <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a>. A letter from a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> name Wigbert to the fathers and brethren in Glestingaburg (Glastonbury) in Somersetshire is preserved. It has been supposed that the writer was St. Wigbert and therefore a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="../cathen/06579a.htm">Glastonbury</a>, but this is not probable. He went to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> about 734, and <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a> made him <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07296c.htm">Hersfeld</a> in <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>; among his pupils there was St. Sturmi, the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>. About 737 <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a> transferred him to <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a> as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Ohrdruf, where he worked with the same success as in Hersfeld. Later Wigbert obtained <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface's</a> permission to return to Hersfeld to spend his remaining days in quiet and to <a href="../cathen/04660c.htm">prepare for death</a>; notwithstanding old age and illness he continued his austere mode of life until his end. He was first <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> at Fritzlar in an inconspicuous grave, but during an incursion of the Saxons (774) his remains were taken for safety to Buraburg, and from there, in 780 by Archbishop Lullus transferred to Hersfeld, where in 850 a beautiful church was built to him; this was burned in 1037. A great fire in 1761 destroyed the new church (dedicated, 1144) and consumed the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> bones, or else they crumbled in the ruins. The <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">veneration</a> of Wigbert flourished especially in <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a> and Thuringia. At the present day he is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> only in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>. He is recorded in the "Martyrologium Romanum" under 13 August.
