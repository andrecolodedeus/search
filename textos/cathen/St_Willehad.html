<h1>St. Willehad</h1>  

<p>Bishop at <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, born in Northumberland before 745; died at Blecazze (Blexen) on the Weser, 8 Nov., 789. He was a friend of <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, and probably received his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at York under <a href="../cathen/05325a.htm">St. Egbert</a>. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, with the permission of King Alchred he was sent to Frisia between 765 and 774. He cannot, therefore, have been a disciple of <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> states in the Roman Martyrology, for <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> had left <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 718 and had died in 754 (755). Willehad came to Dockum, where <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> had received the crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and made many conversions. He crossed the Lauwers, but met with little success at Hugmarke (now Humsterland in the <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">Diocese of M&uuml;nster</a>). He was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave and went to Trianthe (Drenthe in the Diocese of Utrecht). At first all seemed favourable, but later he made little progress. In 780 he was sent by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> to Wigmodia near the North Sea, between the Weser and the Elbe. There <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> blessing accompanied his labours, and he built many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>. The insurrection of the Saxons under Widukind in 782 put an end to his work, many of his companions were killed and his churches destroyed. Willehad escaped and went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was received by <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Adrian I</a>. He then retired to the Abbey of Echternach, and applied himself to the task of copying books, among others he transcribed the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. When the insurrection had been suppressed by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> Willehad returned to Wigmodia and continued his labours. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at Worms on 13 July, 787, and fixed his residence at <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, where he built a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, dedicated on Sunday 1 Nov., 789, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Peter. A few days later, while on a missionary tour, he was attacked with a fever and died. His body, buried at the place of his death, was transferred by his successor St. Willericus to the stone church built by him and placed in a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. A feast on 13 July commemorates the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were lost. His feast was neglected and then forgotten; by permission, however, of the Sacred Congregation of Rites it was reintroduced in 1901 in the Dioceses of Munser, <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> to be observed on a vacant day after 8 November. His life was written by a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a> after 838, but perhaps before 860. The account of his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> was written by St. Ansgar.
