<h1>St. William</h1>  

<p>(WILLIAM FITZHERBERT, also called WILLIAM OF THWAYT).

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>. Tradition represents him as nephew of King Stephen, whose sister Emma was believed to have married Herbert of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, treasurer to Henry I. William became a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and about 1130 he was canon and treasurer of York. In 1142 he was elected <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a> at the instance of the king, in opposition to the candidature of Henry Murdac, a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. The validity of the election was disputed on the ground of alleged <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> and royal influence, and Archbishop Theobald refused to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> him pending an appeal to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> exercised his powerful influence against William in favour of Murdac, but in 1143 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> decided that William should be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, if he could clear himself from the accusation of bribery, and if the chapter could show that there had been no undue royal pressure. William <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> his innocence so conclusively that the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> 26 September, 1143. He set himself at once to carry out reforms in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and his gentleness and charity soon won him popularity; but he neglected to obtain from Cardinal Hincmar the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> which Lucius II sent him in 1146, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> died before William had been invested. The new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, Blessed Eugenius III, was himself a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> soon renewed their complaints against William, which St. Bernard supported. Meanwhile Hincmar carried the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> back to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, so that, in 1147, William had to travel there to obtain it, raising the expenses of his journey by sale of treasurers and privileges belonging to York. This afforded fresh matter of complaint and finally the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> suspended him from his functions on the ground that he had <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> without exacting the pledges required by the former <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.

<p>William took refuge with his friend, the King of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, but his partisans in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> took an unwise revenge by destroying <a href="../cathen/06161a.htm">Fountains Abbey</a>, of which Murdac was now prior. This further inflamed St. William's enemies, who again approached the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, with the result that in 1147 he deposed the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> from his seat; and on the failure of the chapter to elect a successor, he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Murdac in his stead. St. William devoted himself to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> till 1153, when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and St. Bernard were both dead. He then appealed to the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, Anastasius IV, for restoration to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, a request which the death of Murdac in October made it easier to obtain. St. William having received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, returned to <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, where he showed the greatest kindness to the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> who had opposed him, and promised full restitution to <a href="../cathen/06161a.htm">Fountains Abbey</a>. But his death, so sudden as to cause suspicion of poison, took place within a few weeks. <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">Miracles</a> took place at his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, and in 1227 he was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Pope <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>. In 1283 his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were translated to a shrine behind the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of York Minster, where they remained till the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. His festival is observed in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> on 8 June.
