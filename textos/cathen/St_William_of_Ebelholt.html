<h1>St. William of Ebelholt</h1>  

<p>(Also called WILLIAM OF PARIS and WILLIAM OF THE PARACLETE.)

<p>Died on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a>, 1203, and was buried at Ebelholt. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by his uncle Hugh, forty-second <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St-Germain-des-Pres at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; and having been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> received a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve-du-Mont. His exemplary life did not commend him to his fellow canons, who tried to rid themselves of his presence, and even prevented by <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. William obtained this order from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Senlis by his uncle's intercession, and was soon afterwards presented by the canons to the little <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of Epinay. In 1148, by order of <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Pope Eugene III</a>, the secular canons of Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve were replaced by canons regular from the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Parisian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Victor, whose prior, Odo, was made <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of Ste-Genevieve. William soon afterwards joined the new community and was made sub-prior. In this position he showed great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, and on one occasion opposed the entry of a new prior who had obtained his position irregularly; for this he was punished by Abbot Garin, successor of Odo, but his action was finally supported by <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Pope Alexander III</a>.

<p>In 1161 <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/16071c.htm">Roskilde</a>, <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, sent to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> the <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> to obtain canons regular for the reform of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Thomas of Eskils&ouml;e. In 1165 William journeyed to <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> with three companions, and became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of that house. In spite of difficulties arising from poverty and opposition on the part of the community he reformed the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and in 1178 transferred it to Ebelholt, or the Paraclete, in Zeeland. He was entrusted with important business by <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>, now <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09433a.htm">Lund</a>, and intervened in the case of <a href="../cathen/12001a.htm">Philip Augustus of France</a> who was attempting to repudiate his wife Ingelborg, sister of Cnut of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. The genealogy of the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> kings which he drew up on this occasion to disprove the alleged impediment of <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a> and two books of his letters, some of which deal with this affair, have come down to us, and together with an account of probable authenticity of the invention of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve in 1161 and a few charters relating to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> may be found in P.L., CCIX. An account of his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> is given in the "Vita" written by one of his younger disciples. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> in 1224. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is commemorated on 18 June.
