<h1>St. William of Perth</h1>  

<p>(Or ST. WILLIAM OF ROCHESTER).

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a>, born at Perth; died about 1201. Practically all that is known of this <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> comes from the "Nova legenda Anglie", and that is little. In youth he had been somewhat wild, but on reaching manhood he devoted himself wholly to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. A baker by trade, he was accustomed to set aside every tenth loaf for the poor. He went to Mass daily, and one morning, before it was light, found on the threshold of the church an abandoned child, whom he adopted and to whom he taught his trade. Later he took a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to visit the Holy Places, and, having received the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> wallet and staff, set out with his adopted son, whose name is given as "Cockermay Doucri", which is said to be Scots for "David the Foundling". They stayed three days at Rochester, and purposed to proceed next day to <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, but instead David wilfully misled his benefactor and, with <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> in view, felled him with a blow on the head and cut his throat. The body was discovered by a mad <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who plaited a garland of flowers and placed it first on the head of the corpse and then her own, whereupon the madness left her. On learning her tale the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Rochester carried the body to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and there buried it. In 1256 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rochester, Lawrence de S. Martino, obtained the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of St. William by Pope Alexander IV. A beginning was at once made with his shrine, which was situated in the northeast <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a>, and attracted crowds of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. At the same time a small <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was built at the place of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, which was thereafter called Palmersdene. Remains of this <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> are still to be seen near the present St. William's Hospital, on the road leading by Horsted Farm to Maidstone. On 18 and 19 February, 1300, King Edward I gave two donations of seven shillings to the shrine. On 29 November, 1399, <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Pope Boniface IX</a> granted an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> to those who visited and gave <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to the shrine on certain specified days. St. William is represented in a wall-painting, which was discovered in 1883 in Frindsbury church, near Rochester, which is supposed to have been <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> about 1256-1266. His feast was kept on 23 May.
