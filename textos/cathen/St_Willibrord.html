<h1>St. Willibrord</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, Apostle of the Frisians, and son of St. Hilgis, born in Northumbria, 658; died at <a href="../cathen/05270d.htm">Echternach</a>, <a href="../cathen/09465a.htm">Luxemburg</a>, 7 Nov., 739. Willibrord made his early studies at the Abbey of Ripon near <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, as a disciple of <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a>, and then entered the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>. When twenty years old he went to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and spent twelve years in the Abbey of Rathmelsigi (identified by some as Mellifont in Co. Louth) under <a href="../cathen/05325a.htm">St. Egbert</a>. From him Willibrord and eleven companions received the mission to Frisia, at the request of Pepin. They came to Utrecht but did not remain there, repairing to the court of Pepin. In 692 Willibrord went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, received Apostolic authorization, and returned to his missionary labours. At the wish of Pepin he went for a second time to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the Frisians by <a href="../cathen/13729a.htm">Sergius III</a> (21 Nov., 695) in the Church of St. Cecilia, and given the name of Clement. He also received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. On his return he laboured among the people assigned to him; to raise recruits for future apostolic work he founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, where also he built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Holy Redeemer</a> and made it his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In 698 he established an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at the Villa Echternach on the Sure; this villa had been presented to him by St. Irmina, daughter of St. Dagobert II, the donation being legally confirmed in 706.

<p>When Radbod gained possession of all Frisia (716) Willibrord was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave, and Radbod destroyed most of the churches, replaced them by <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> and shrines to the idols, and killed many of the missionaries. Willibrord and his companions made trips between the Maas and the Waal, to the North of Brabant, in <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a> and Geldria, but met with no success in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and Helgoland. After the death of Radbod he returned (719) and repaired the damages done there, being ably assisted in this work by <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>. Numberless conversions were the result of their labour. Willibrord frequently retired to the Abbey of Echternach to provide more particularly for his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; he was buried in the oratory of this <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and after death was almost immediately <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a saint. Some <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were distributed in various churches, but the greater part remained at the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. On 19 Oct., 1031, the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were placed in a shrine under the main altar of the new basilica. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 7 Nov., but in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, by order of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, on 29 Nov. Since his burial Echternacht has been a place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> mentions <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> wrought there. The old church was restored in 1862 and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in Sept., 1868. Another solemn translation of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> took place on 4 June, 1906, from the Church of St. Peter to the new basilica. On this occasion occurred also the annual procession of the holy dancers (see ABBEY OF ECHTERNACH &#151; <em>The Dancing Procession</em>). Five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in full pontificals assisted; engaged in the dance were 2 <a href="../cathen/15276b.htm#swissguard">Swiss guards</a>, 16 standard-bearers, 3045 singers, 136 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 426 musicians, 15,085 dancers, and 2032 players (Studien u. Mittheilungen, 1906, 551).

<p>No writing can with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> be attributed to St. Willibrord except a marginal note in the Calendar of Echternach giving some chronological data. On his testament or last will, which is probably genuine, see "Acts SS.", III Nov., 631. In the national <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (No. 9389) there is a copy of the Gospels under the name of Willibrord; this is an old <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> and was probably brought by Willibrord from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> (Bellesheim, "Gesch. der kath. Kirche in Irland", I, Mainz, 1890, 623).

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The <em>Life</em> was written by Alcuin and dedicated to BEORNRAD. (Abbot of Echternach). He probably made use of an older one written by a British monk, which is lost. This was used also by THEOFRIC.</p></div>
