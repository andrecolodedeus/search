<h1>St. Willigis</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, d. 23 Feb., 1011. Feast, 23 February or 18 April. Though of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> birth he received a good <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and through the influence of Bishop Volkold of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a> entered the service of <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a>, and after 971 figured as chancellor of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a> in 975 made him <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and Archchancellor of the Empire, in which capacity he did valuable service to the State. Hauch (Kirchengesch. Deutschlands, III, Leipzig, 1906, 414) calls him an ideal <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the tenth century. Well <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> himself, he demanded solid learning in his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. He was known as a good and fluent speaker. In March, 975, he received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> from <a href="../cathen/02428d.htm">Benedict VII</a> and was named <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. As such, on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, 983, he <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, and in June, 1002, performed the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of Henry II at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>; he presided at the Synod of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, 1007, at which thirty-five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> signed the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/08429a.htm">John XVIII</a> for the erection of the <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Diocese of Bamberg</a>. He always stood in friendly relations with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> ("Katholik", 1911, 142). In 996 he was in the retinue of <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> on his journey to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, assisted at the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of <a href="../cathen/06790a.htm">Gregory V</a> and at the synod convened a few days later. In this synod Willigis strongly urged the return of <a href="../cathen/01127c.htm">St. Adalbert</a> to <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, which <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. Willigis had probably <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/05047d.htm">Thietmar</a> (January, 976), at Brumath in Alsace (Hauch, III, 193), and had <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/01127c.htm">St. Adalbert</a>. The latter, unable to bear the opposition to his labours, left his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and was, after much correspondence between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and Willigis, forced to return.

<p>In 997 <a href="../cathen/06790a.htm">Gregory V</a> sent the decrees of a synod of Pavia to Willigis, "his vicar", for publication. These friendly relations were somewhat disturbed by the dispute of Willigis with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a> about <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Gundersheim. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> was originally situated at Brunshausen in the <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Diocese of Hildesheim</a>, but was transferred to Gundersheim, within the limits of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. Both <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> claimed <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. After much correspondence and several <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> Pope Silvester declared in favour of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>. When this sentence was about to be published at a synod of Pohlde (22 June, 1001), Willigis, who was there, left in great excitement in spite of the remonstrances of the delegate, who then placed the sentence of suspension on the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Formal opposition to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was not intended, but if Willigis committed any fault in the matter he publicly rectified all by a declaration at Gundersheim on 5 Jan., 1007, when he resigned all claims to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a> (Katholik, loc. cit., p. 145). In his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> he laboured by building bridges, constructing roads, and fostering art. In <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> he built a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> it on 29 Aug., 1009, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Martin, but on the same day it was destroyed by fire; he greatly helped the restoration of the old Church of St. Victor and built that of St. Stephen. He also built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> at Brunnen, in Nassau. He showed great solicitude for the religious, and substantially aided the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Bleidenstadt, <a href="../cathen/05037a.htm">St. Disibod</a>, and Jechaburg in <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>. After death he was buried in the Church of St. Stephen.
