<h1>St. Winefride</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/07438a.htm">Holywell</a>, <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, about 600; died at Gwytherin, <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, 3 Nov., 660. Her father was Thevit, a Cambrian magnate, the possessor of three manors in what is now Flintshire; her mother Wenlo, a sister of <a href="../cathen/02540a.htm">St. Beuno</a> and a member of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> closely connected with the kings of South <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>. <a href="../cathen/02540a.htm">St. Beuno</a> had led at first a solitary life, but afterwards established a community of cenobites at Clynog-vawr. While in search of a suitable place for a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> he came to visit his sister's husband whose lands lay on a bluff overlooking the town of <a href="../cathen/07438a.htm">Holywell</a> on the valley side of the well, and over against the present ruins of the Abbey of Basingstoke; tradition points this out as the spot on which the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Winefride was afterwards built. From this eminence there is a steep incline down to the stream and the well. In the hollow, then called the "Dry Hollow", beneath this incline <a href="../cathen/02540a.htm">St. Beuno</a> lived and built a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in which he said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> and preached to the people. Winefride was then one of his most attentive listeners. Though only fifteen years old she gave herself to a life of devotion and austerity, passing whole nights watching in the church. Prior to the conquest of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was known as Guenevra; after that her name was changed to the English form of Winefride. She was a maiden of great personal charm and endowed with rare gifts of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Under the guidance of <a href="../cathen/02540a.htm">St. Beuno</a>, Winefride made rapid progress in virtue and learning and with her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents'</a> consent prepared to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> herself to God.

<p>The fame of her beauty and accomplishments had reached the ears of Caradoc, son of the neighbouring Prince Alen, who resolved to seek her hand in marriage. Coming in person to press his suit he entered the house of Thevit, and found Winefride alone, her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> having gone early to Mass. The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that Winefride had resolved to quit the world and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> herself to God seemed only to add fuel to his passion, and he pleaded his cause with extraordinary vehemence, even proceeding to threats as he saw her turn indignantly away. At length, terrified at his words and alarmed for her innocence, the maiden escaped from the house, and hurried towards the church, where her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were hearing <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>, that was being celebrated by her uncle, <a href="../cathen/02540a.htm">St. Beuno</a>. Maddened by a disappointed passion, Caradoc pursued her and, overtaking her on the slope above the site of the present well, he drew his sword and at one blow severed her head from the body. The head rolled down the incline and, where it rested, there gushed forth a spring. <a href="../cathen/02540a.htm">St. Beuno</a>, hearing of the tragedy, left the altar, and accompanied by the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> came to the spot where the head lay beside the spring. Taking up the maiden's head he carried it to where the body lay, covered both with his cloak, and then re-entered the church to finish the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>. When <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> was ended he <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">knelt</a> beside the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> body, offered up a fervent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to God, and ordered the cloak which covered it to be removed. Thereupon Winefride, as if awakening from a deep slumber, rose up with no sign of the severance of the head except a thin white circle round her neck. Seeing the murderer leaning on his sword with an insolent and defiant air, <a href="../cathen/02540a.htm">St. Beuno</a> invoked the chastisement of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and Caradoc fell dead on the spot, the popular <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> being that the ground opened and swallowed him.

<p>Miraculously restored to life, Winefride seems to have lived in almost perpetual ecstasy and to have had familiar converse with God. In fulfillment of her promise, she solemnly vowed virginity and poverty as a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluse</a>. A <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> was built on her father's land, where she became the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> of a community of young maidens, and a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was erected over the well. <a href="../cathen/02540a.htm">St. Beuno</a> left Holywell, and returned to C&aelig;rnarvon. Before he left the tradition is that he seated himself upon the stone, which now stands in the outer well pool, and there promised in the name of God "that whosoever on that spot should thrice ask for a benefit from God in the name of St. Winefride would obtain the grace he asked if it was for the good of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." St. Winefride on her part made agreement with <a href="../cathen/02540a.htm">St. Beuno</a> that so long as she remained at <a href="../cathen/07438a.htm">Holywell</a>, and until she heard of his death, she would yearly send him a memorial of her affection for him. After eight years spent at <a href="../cathen/07438a.htm">Holywell</a> (reckoning from the departure of <a href="../cathen/02540a.htm">St. Beuno</a>), St. Winefride, hearing of his death, received an inspiration to leave the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and retire inland. There was reason to fear that <a href="../cathen/07438a.htm">Holywell</a> would soon be no longer safe from the Saxon. The Kingdom of Northumbria was pressing upon the boarders of North <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>; Anglesea and Chester were already in the hands of the Saxon. It was time for the British <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluses</a> to seek the safety of the mountains; accordingly St. Winefride went upon her <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to seek for a place of rest. Ultimately she arrived at Gwytherin near the source of the River Elwy. This is still a most retired spot, where <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> alone is spoken.

<p>Some ten miles further across the vale of the Conway rises the double peak of Snowdon. St. Winefride was welcomed at Gwytherin by St. Elwy (Elerius), who gives his name to the River Elwy, and by whom the first life of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was written. She brought her companion religious with her, and found there other <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> governed by an <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>. She seems to have lived at Gwytherin as an acknowledged saint on earth, first in <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> obedience to the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>, and, after the latter's death, as <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> herself until her own death. Her chief feast is observed on 3 Nov., the other feast held in midsummer being that of her <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Her death was foreshown to her in a vision by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself.

<p>During her life she performed many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and after her death, up to the present day, countless wonders and favours continue to be worked and obtained through her <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a>.

<p>The details of St. Winefride's life are gathered from a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> in the British Museum, said to have been the work of the British <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, Elerius, a contemporary of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, and also from a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> life in the Bodleian Library, generally believed to have been compiled (1130) by Robert, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of <a href="../cathen/13759c.htm">Shrewsbury</a>.
