<h1>St. Winwallus</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Landevennec; d. 3 March, probably at the beginning of the sixth century, though the exact year is not known. There are some fifty forms of his name, ranging from Wynwallow through such variants as Wingaloeus, Waloway, Wynolatus, Vinguavally, Vennole, Valois, Ouignoualey, Gweno, Gunnolo, to Bennoc. The original form is undistinguishable. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the commonest are Winwalloc or Winwalloe; in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Guenole or Guingalois.

<p>His father, Fracan, was a British chieftain who fled before Saxon invaders to Brittany, where the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was born. After considerable difficulty in overcoming his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> objections, Winwallus entered the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> under the guidance of St. Budoc on the Island of Laurels near Isleverte. After residing here for some time he determined to go to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> to place himself under the great <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, but was deterred by a dream in which that saint appeared to him forbidding the journey, but telling him he must soon leave St. Budoc. Accordingly he set out with eleven companions, and, after a time spent in extraordinary austerities on the Island of Tibidi at the mouth of the River Aven, finally settled at Landevennec, where he founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on a rocky headland not far from Brest. After his death many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were ascribed to him. His body was carried to <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> at the time of the Norman forays. <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">Relics</a> were preserved at Montreuil-sur-Mer (where a church was dedicated to him under the name of St. Walow), at St. Peter's in <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, and elsewhere. His <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> was to be seen in the church of Landevennec up to the beginning of the nineteenth century. The Abbey of Landevennec became <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> in the ninth century, and was in the hands of the Congregation of St. Maur at the final suppression. St. Winwallus's feast is kept on 3 March, ad that of his translation on 28 April. His name has been preserved in the dedications of churches in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of Wonastow in Monmouthshire (where he is known as St. Wonnow), and of Gunwalloc, St. Cleer, and Landewednack in Cornwall. It was been suggested that the last-named <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> got its name from some monastic dependency of Landevennec.
