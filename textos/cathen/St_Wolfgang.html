<h1>St. Wolfgang</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> (972-994), born about 934; died at the village of Pupping in upper <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, 31 October, 994. The name Wolfgang is of early German origin. St. Wolfgang was one of the three brilliant stars of the tenth century, St. Ulrich, St. Conrad, and St. Wolfgang, which illuminated the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval period</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> with the undying splendour of their acts and services. St. Wolfgang sprang from a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Swabian counts of Pfullingen (Mon. Germ. His.: Script., X, 53). When seven years old he had an ecclesiastic as tutor at home; later he attended the celebrated <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> on the <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a>. Here he formed a strong friendship with Henry, brother of Bishop Poppo of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, whom he followed to <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> in order to attend at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> there the lectures of the noted Italian grammarian, Stephen of <a href="../cathen/11134b.htm">Novara</a>. After Henry was made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> in 956, he called his friend to <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, where Wolfgang became a teacher in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and also laboured for the reform of the archdiocese, notwithstanding the enmity with which his efforts were met. Wolfgang's residence at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> greatly influenced his monastic and ascetic tendencies, as here he came into connection with the great reformatory <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the tenth century, St. Maximin of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, where he made the acquaintance of Ramwold, the teacher of <a href="../cathen/01127c.htm">St. Adalbert</a> of Prague. After the death (964) of Archbishop Henry of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, Wolfgang entered the Order of St. Benedict in the Abbey of Maria <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by St. Ulrich in 968.

<p>After their defeat in the battle of the Lechfeld (955), a victory gained with the aid of St. Ulrich, the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> Magyars settled in ancient Pannonia. As long as they were not <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> they remained a constant menace to the empire. At the request of St. Ulrich, who clearly saw the danger, and at the desire of the Emperor Otto the Great, St. Wolfgang, according to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> annals, was "sent to Magyars" as the most suitable man to evangelize them. He was followed by other missionaries sent by <a href="../cathen/12099a.htm">Bishop Piligrim of Nassau</a>, under whose <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> the new missionary region came. After the death of Bishop Michael of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> (23 September, 972) <a href="../cathen/12099a.htm">Bishop Piligrim</a> obtained from the emperor the appointment of Wolfgang as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> (<a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, 972). Wolfgang's services in this new position were of the highest importance, not only for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but also for the cause of civilization. As <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, Wolfgang became the tutor of Emperor <a href="../cathen/07227a.htm">St. Henry II</a>, who learned from him the principles which governed his saintly and energetic life. Poppe, son of Margrave Luitpold, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> (1016), and Tagino, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> (1004-1012), also had him as their teacher.

<p>St. Wolfgang deserves credit for his disciplinary labours in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. His main work in this respect was connected with the ancient and celebrated Abbey of <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a> which he reformed by granting it once more <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of its own, thus withdrawing it from the control of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, who for many years had been <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> <em><a href="../cathen/07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em>, a condition of affairs that had been far from beneficial to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and monastic life. In the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Ramwold, whom St. Wolfgang called from St. Maximin at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a> received a capable <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> (975). The saint also reformed the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of Obermunster and Niedermunster at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, chiefly by giving them as an example the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Paul, Mittelmunster, at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, which he had founded in 983. He also co-operated in the reform of the ancient and celebrated <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Altach (Nieder-altach), which had been founded by the Agilolf dynasty, and which from that time took on new life. He showed genuine episcopal generosity in the liberal manner with which he met the views of the Emperor <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a> regarding the intended reduction in size of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> for the benefit of the new Diocese of Prague (975), to which <a href="../cathen/01127c.htm">St. Adalbert</a> was appointed first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. As prince of the empire he performed his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> towards the emperor and the empire with the utmost scrupulousness and, like St. Ulrich, was one of the mainstays of the Ottonian policies. He took part in the various imperial Diets, and, in the autumn of 978, accompanied the Emperor <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a> on his campaign to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and took part in the great Diet of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> in June, 983.

<p>St. Wolfgang withdrew as a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> to a solitary spot, now the Lake of St. Wolfgang, apparently on account of a political dispute, but probably in the course of a journey of inspection to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Mendsee which was under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. He was discovered by a hunter and brought back to <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. While travelling on the Danube to P&ouml;chlarn in Lower <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, he fell ill at the village of Pupping, which is between Efferding and the market town of Aschach near <a href="../cathen/09273a.htm">Linz</a>, and at his request was carried into the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of <a href="../cathen/11351a.htm">St. Othmar</a> at Pupping, where he died. His body was taken up the Danube by his friends Count Aribo of Andechs and Archbishop Hartwich of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> to <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> buried in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a>. Many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were performed at his grave; in 1052 he was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>. Soon after his death many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> chose him as their <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a>, and various towns were named after him. In <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> he has been especially <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by the great <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Tyrolese <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, Michael Pacher (1430-1498), who created an imperishable memorial of him, the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of St. Wolfgang. In the panel pictures which are now exhibited in the Old Pinakothek at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> are depicted in an artistic manner the chief events in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> life. The oldest portrait of St. Wolfgang is a miniature, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> about the year 1100 in the celebrated Evangeliary of <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a>, now in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the castle <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Cracow. A fine modern picture by <a href="../cathen/13598a.htm">Schwind</a> is in the Schak Gallery at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>. This <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> represents the legend of Wolfgang forcing the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> to help him to build a church. In other <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> he is generally depicted in episcopal dress, an axe in the right hand and the <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crozier</a> in the left, or as a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> in the wilderness being discovered by a hunter. The axe refers to an event in the life of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. After having selected a solitary spot in the wilderness, he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> and then threw his axe into the thicket; the spot on which the axe fell he regarded as the place where <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> intended he should build his cell. This axe is still shown in the little market town of St. Wolfgang which sprang up on the spot of the old cell. At the request of the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a>, the life of St. Wolfgang was written by <a href="../cathen/11350b.htm">Othlo</a>, a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a> about 1050. This life is especially important for the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> history both of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and of civilization in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and it forms the basis of all later accounts of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. The oldest and best <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of this "Life" is in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the Abbey of Maria <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a> in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> (<a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> No. 322), and has been printed with critical notes in "Mon. Germ. His.: Script.", IV, 524-542. It has also been printed in, "Acta SS.", II November, (Brussels, 1894), 529-537; "Acta SS. O. S. Ben.", V, 812-833; and in P.L., CXLVI, 395-422.
