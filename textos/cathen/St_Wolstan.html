<h1>St. Wolstan</h1>  

<p>Benedictine, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, b. at Long Itchington, Warwickshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, about 1008; d. at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, 19 Jan., 1095. <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">Educated</a> at the great <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/05648a.htm">Evesham</a> and Peterborough, he resolutely combated and overcame the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> of his youth, and entered the service of Brithege, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, who <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> him <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> about 1038. Refusing all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> preferment, he became a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> in the great <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, and after holding various offices in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> became <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> prior there. He held this position, edifying all by his charity, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of life, and strict observance of the rule, until 1062, when the <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">See of Worcester</a> fell vacant by the translation of Bishop Aldred to the Archbishopric of York. Two <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Roman cardinals</a>, who had been Wolstan's guests at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> during <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, recommended the holy prior to King Edward for the vacant see, to which he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 8 September, 1062. Not a man of special learning or commanding <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, he devoted his whole life to the care of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, visiting, preaching, and confirming without intermission, rebuilding his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in the simple Saxon style, planting new churches everywhere, and retaining the ascetic personal habits which he had acquired in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. His life, notwithstanding his assiduous labours, was one of continuous <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and recollection; the Psalms were always on his lips, and he recited the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> aloud with his attendants as he rode through the country in discharge of his episcopal <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. Wolstan was the last <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> appointed under a Saxon king, the last episcopal representative of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> and of Cuthbert, and the link between it and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a> and Anselm. After the Conquest, when nearly all the Saxon nobles and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were deprived of their offices and honours in favour of the Normans, Wolstan retained his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and gradually won the esteem and confidence both of <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a> and of the Conqueror himself. &AElig;lred of Rievaulx tells the legend of his being called upon to resign his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, and of his laying his <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crozier</a> on the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Edward the Confessor at <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crozier</a> remained immoveable &#151; a sign from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, as was believed, that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was to retain his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. He survived both William the Conqueror and <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a>, and was one of the consecrators of <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>.
