<h1>St. Zenobius</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a> and one of the patrons of that city, b. there in the latter part of the reign of Constantine I; d. 337. Carefully <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, he came early under the influence of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Theodore, was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by him, and succeeded, after much opposition, in bringing his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father and mother</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>. He embraced the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> state, and rapidly rose to the position of <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, when his virtues and notable powers as a preacher made him known to St. Ambrose, at whose instance Pope Damasus (366-86) called him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and employed him in various important missions, including a legation to Constantinople. On the death of Damasus he returned to his native city, where he resumed his apostolic labours, and on the death of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that see, Zenobius, to the great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the people, was appointed to succeed him. The ancient legends of his episcopal career &#151; in which, however, there are many interpolations of a later date &#151; are unanimous in their description of his saintly life and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">supernatural gifts</a>. Extraordinary <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, including several instances of the restoration of the dead to life, are attributed to him, and during his prolonged episcopate his fervour and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> never for a moment flagged. According to his biographer and successor in the See of Florence, Antonius, he died in his ninetieth year, in 424; but, as Antonius says that Innocent I (d. 417) was at the time <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the date is uncertain. There is ground for <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that he actually died in 417, on 25 May, on which day the ancient tower where he is supposed to have lived, near the Ponte Vecchio, is annually decorated with flowers. His body was first buried in the Basilica of St. Laurence (<a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by St. Ambrose in 393), and was later translated to San Salvador's church, on the site of the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Beneath the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> is the silver shrine of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, designed by <a href="../cathen/06544a.htm">Ghiberti</a> about 1440, inn the same style as his famous bronze gates. There is a statute of Zenobus in San Marco, and other memorials of him in the city, where his name and memory are still <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>.
