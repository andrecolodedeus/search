<h1>St. Zita</h1>  

<p>Model and heavenly patroness of domestic servants, born early in the thirteenth century of a poor <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> at Montsegradi, a little village near <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>; died at <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, 27 April, 1271. A naturally <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> disposition and the teaching of a virtuous mother, aided by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>, developed in the child's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that sweetness and modesty of character and continual and conscientious application to work which constituted her especial virtues. At the age of twelve she entered the service of the Fatinelli <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>. Her <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and the exactitude with which she discharged her domestic <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, in which she regarded herself as serving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rather than man, even supplying the deficiencies of her fellow servants, far from gaining for her their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and esteem and that of her employers rather brought upon her every manner of ill-treatment of both the former and, through their accusations, of the latter. The incessant ill-usage, however, was powerless to deprive her of her inward peace, her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of those who wronged her, and her respect for her employers. By this meek and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> self-restraint she at last succeeded in overcoming the malice of her fellow-servants and her employers, so much so that she was placed in charge of all the affairs of the house.

<p>In her position of command over all the servants she treated all with kindness, not exacting from them any reckoning for the wrongs she had for so many years suffered from them. She was always circumspect, and only severe when there was a question of checking the introduction of vice among the servants. On the other hand, if any of them had been guilty of shortcomings, she took upon herself to excuse or defend them to their employers. Using the ample authority given her by her employers, she was generous in <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>, but careful to assist only those really in need. After her death numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were wrought at her intercession, so that she came to be <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a saint in the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, and the poets Fazio degli Uberti (Dittamonde, III, 6) and <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> (Inferno, XI, 38) both designate the city of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a> simply as "Santa Zita". The office in her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> was approved by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>.

<p>In 1580 her <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> was discovered in the Church of S. Frediano; thus was suggested the solemn <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of her cult, which was granted by <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> in 1696. The earliest biography of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> is preserved in an anonymous <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> belonging to the Fatinelli <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> which was published at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> in 1688 by Monsignor Fatinelli, "Vita beatf Zitf virginis Lucensis ex vetustissimo codice manuscripto fideliter transumpta". For his fuller "Vita e miracoli di S. Zita vergine lucchese" (Lucca, 1752) Bartolomeo Fiorito has used this and other notices, especially those taken from the process drawn up to prove the immemorial cult.
