<h1>St. &AElig;lred</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Rievaulx, homilist and historian (1109-66). St. &AElig;lred, whose name is also written Ailred, &AElig;thelred, and Ethelred, was the son of one of those married <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of whom many were found in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. He was born at <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Hexham</a>, but at an early age made the acquaintance of David, St. Margaret's youngest son, shortly afterwards King of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, at whose court he apparently acted for some years as a sort of page, or companion to the young Prince Henry. King David <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> English youth, promoted him in his household, and wished to make him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but &AElig;lred decided to become a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, in the recently founded abbey of Rievaulx in Yorkshire. Soon he was appointed master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, and was long remembered for his extraordinary tenderness and patience towards those under his charge. In 1143 when William, Earl of Lincoln, founded a new <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> upon his estates at Revesby in Lincolnshire, St. &AElig;lred was sent with twelve <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to take possession of the new foundation. His stay at Revesby, where he seems to have met <a href="../cathen/06557b.htm">St. Gilbert of Sempringham</a>, was not of long duration, for in 1146 he was elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of Rievaulx. In this position the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was not only superior of a community of 300 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, but he was head of all the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Causes were referred to him, and often he had to undertake considerable journeys to visit the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of his order. Such a journey in 1153 took him to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and there meeting King David, for the last time, he wrote on his return to Rievaulx, where the news of David's death reached him shortly afterwards, a sympathetic sketch of the character of the late king. He seems to have exercised considerable influence over Henry II, in the early years of his reign, and to have persuaded him to join Louis VII of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in meeting <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Pope Alexander III</a>, at Touci, in 1162. Although suffering from a complication of most painful maladies, he journeyed to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to attend the general chapter of his Order. He was present in <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster Abbey</a>, at the translation of <a href="../cathen/05322a.htm">St. Edward the Confessor</a>, in 1163, and, in view of this event, he both wrote a life of the saintly king and preached a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> in his praise. The next year &AElig;lred undertook a mission to the barbarous Pictish tribes of <a href="../cathen/06370a.htm">Galloway</a>, where their chief is said to have been so deeply moved by his exhortations that he became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. Throughout his last years &AElig;lred gave an extraordinary example of heroic patience under a succession of infirmities. He was, moreover, so abstemious that he is described as being "more like a ghost than a man." His death is generally supposed to have occurred 12 January, 1166, although there are reasons for thinking that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> year may be 1167. St. &AElig;lred left a considerable collection of sermons, the remarkable eloquence of which has earned for him the title of the English <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>. He was the author of several <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> treatises, notably the "Speculum Charitatis," also a compendium of the same (really a rough draught from which the larger work was developed), a treatise "De Spirituali Amiciti&acirc;," and a certain letter to an <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchoress</a>. All these, together with a fragment of his historical work, were collected an published by Richard Gibbons, S.J., at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, in 1631. A fuller and better edition is contained in the fifth volume of the "Bibliotheca Cisterciensis" of Tissier, 1662, from which they have been printed in P.L., vol. CXCV. The historical works include a "Life of St. Edward," an important account of the "Battle of the Standard" (1138), an incomplete work on the genealogy of the kings of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, a tractate "De Sanctimonialide Watton" (About the Nun of Watton), a "Life of <a href="../cathen/11084a.htm">St. Ninian</a>," a work on the "<a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">Miracles</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Hexham</a>," an account of the foundations of St. Mary of York and <a href="../cathen/06161a.htm">Fountains Abbey</a>, as well as some that are lost. No complete edition of &AElig;lred's historical <em>opuscula</em> has ever been published. A few were printed by Twysden in his "Decem Scriptores," others must be sought in the Rolls Series or in Raine's "Priory of Hexham" (Surtees Society, Durham, 1864).

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">An anonymous Latin Life of St. &AElig;lred is printed by the Bollandists, <em>Acta SS.</em>, January, vol. II; while other materials may be gathered from RAINE, <em>Priory of Hexham</em>, and from &AElig;lred's own writings. An excellent short biography was compiled by Father Dalgairns for NEWMAN's series of <em>Lives of the English Saints</em>, 1845 (new ed., London, 1903); <em>Dict. of Nat.
