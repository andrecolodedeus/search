<h1>Stanbrook Abbey</h1>  

<p>An abbey of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, midway between Malvern and <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and church are dedicated to Our Lady of Consolation, the title of the original foundation at <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, Spanish <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, 1625, effected by the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Monks of the English Congregation, under whose immediate <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> the community has always remained. Of the nine English ladies who began the foundation, <a href="../cathen/10564b.htm">Helen More (Dame Gertrude)</a> was chief foundress because of the liberality of her father, Cresacre More, great-grandson of <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">Sir Thomas More</a>; wherefore the community has special claims on the patronage of this blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. The other ladies were: Margaret Vavasour; Anne Morgan; Catherine Gascoigne; Grace and Ann More, cousins of Helen; Frances Watson; and two lay sisters, Mary Hoskins and Jane Martin. Dame Frances Gawen, one of three <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> lent by the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> to train the <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a>, governed as <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> until the infant community was in a position to choose one from its own body, Dame Catherine Gascoigne, <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>, 1629-1676. <a href="../cathen/02212b.htm">Dom Augustine Baker</a>, to whom their spiritual formation was entrusted, wrote at the Cambrai Abbey, for their use, spiritual treatises, which gave him celebrity. In 1793 the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French revolutionists</a>, seizing their house and <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, conveyed the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, twenty-two in number, to a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> in Compi&#232;gne. Here, consequent on hardship, four of them died, as also the Very Reverend Dom Augustine Walker, President of the Anglo-Benedictine Congregation, who had been arrested in their priests' quarters. Subsequently they had as fellow-prisoners the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> (since <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a>), who were led thence to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, July, 1794. Though a similar death awaited the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, this was averted by the downfall of Robespierre, their deliverance from jail being effected only on 25 April, 1795. Clad in worn-out secular attire left in the Compi&#232;gne <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, they reached <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in utter destitution, but were charitably lodged in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> for some days. Thence they proceeded to Lancashire, where the Very Reverend Dr. Brewer, President of the Anglo-Benedictine Congregation, made over to them the Ladies' School belonging to the Woolton mission under his care.

<p>In 1807 the community removed to <a href="../cathen/13399a.htm">Salford</a> Hall, near <a href="../cathen/05648a.htm">Evesham</a>, where by the joint kindness of its owner, Mrs. Stanford, and the life-heir, Robert Berkeley, Esq., of Spetchly, they lived free of rent, till able to purchase Stanbrook Hall, to which they removed in 1838. In 1871 an entirely new monastic structure was inaugurated by the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the abbey-church, designed by Edward Welby Pugin. The starting of this project was mainly attributable to the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and energy of the then <em>Vicarius monialium,</em> Dom James Laurence Shepherd, the well-known translator of <a href="../cathen/07058a.htm">Dom Gu&eacute;ranger's</a> "Ann&eacute;e Liturgique". The rest of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> building, of which Messrs. Cuthbert and Peter-Paul Pugin were the architects, was gradually erected during the abbacy of Lady Gertrude L. d'Aurillac Dubois, d. 1897. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, with its extensive grounds, is enclosed by the canonical wall completed by the present <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>. As formerly at <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, so at Stanbrook the solemn celebration of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, strictness of enclosure, and monastic observance are leading features. Though essentially devoted to the contemplative life, the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> receive for <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> within the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> a small number of alumn&aelig;. They are girls of the upper classes of life, and are fitted for their future position in <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> by a strong traditionary training on monastic lines according to the spirit of <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">St. Benedict's Rule</a>. Stanbrook Abbey has some reputation for its contributions to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature, as also to the popularization of <a href="../cathen/06779a.htm">Gregorian Chant</a>. Lady Cecilia A. Heywood, who was blessed <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> in November, 1897, is the twentieth in succession from the year 1629.
