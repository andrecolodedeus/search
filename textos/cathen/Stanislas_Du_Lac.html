<h1>Stanislas Du Lac</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> educationist and social work, b. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 21 November, 1835; d. there, 30 August, 1909. His father, Louis Paul Albert du Lac de Fug&egrave;res, was descended from a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, noted in history as early as 1206, and his mother was Camille de Rouvroy de Lamairie. Entering into the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at Issenheim, in Alsace, October 28, 1853, he studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at Laval till 1869, when he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by Mgr. Wicart, 19 September. The following summer (1870) he was made <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the new College of Sainte-Croix, at <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Mans</a>, where, during the Franco-Prussian <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, he organized an efficient <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> service. During the ten months of his rectorship at <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Mans</a>, twenty-two thousand soldiers sojourned successively in his college. In October, 1871, he succeeded the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> Father L&eacute;on Ducoudray as Rector of the Ecole Sainte-Genevi&egrave;ve, generally called "La Rue des Postes", an institution which prepared candidates for the great military and scientific <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. During his rectorship, from 1872 to 1881, 213 of his pupils were admitted to the Ecole Centrale, 328to the Ecole Polytechnique, and 830 to Saint-Cyr. With a rare combination of firmness and gentleness he trained his students to be such fearless <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> that they gradually infused a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> spirit into the military <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Saint-Cyr. This, together with their unparalleled success at the entrance examinations, was the real cause of the closing of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a> in 1880 and of the subsequent <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In 1880 he founded a new French college, St. Mary's, at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where he remained as <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> nine years, <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> by all who met him, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The last twenty years of his life were spent in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Versailles, as preacher, director of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and founder of the "Syndicat de l'Aiguille", a collection of loan and benefit <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> for needlewomen, dressmakers, seamstresses, especially those young sewing girls who are called <em>midinettes</em>. As early as 1901 this syndicate, which has spread all over <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, counted more than two thousand members and two hundred lady patronesses in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> alone, where its two restaurants, reserved exclusively for members, had served more than a million meals, and where its preventive <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> had saved and consoled thousands of young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Father du Lac had been for many years, in the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> anti-Catholic multitude, the personification of the scheming <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him best thought him only too frank, too apt to waste his kindness on men whose <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was implacable. He wrote two books: "France" (Paris, 1888), which vividly portrays the affectionate relations between the Rector of St. Mary's, <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, and his French boys; and "J&eacute;suites" (Paris, 1901), a <a href="../cathen/14103a.htm">defence of the Society of Jesus</a>, containing many autobiographical reminiscences. In the last long months of illness <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> took him away from the strife of tongues into the solitude of a religious house which was not his own, a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> where he died in poverty and perfect trust.
