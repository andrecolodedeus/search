<h1>Stanislaus Konarski</h1>  

<p>Born in 1700; died in 1773. This great reformer of Polish <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> was a <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarist</a> who, during a visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> after his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, received there the first <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of his life's mission. Returning to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> through <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (whose systems of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> he studied on his way), and at first unsuccessful in his plans, he set to compiling the "Volumina Legum", the first volume appearing in 1732. About the end of Augustus II's reign, and during the interregnum which followed, he wrote much in favour of Stanislaus Leszczynski, and, subsequently travelling in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> and in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, stayed for a time at the exiled king's court. Here he became convinced that reform in politics must be preceded by reform in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and, returning home in 1738, he attempted to change the subject-matter and methods of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. Good school-books and teachers were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>; the latter he tried to train himself as "Magister novitiorum" at Rzeszow college, and then sent them either to be tutors of young noblemen or to study abroad at his own cost. In 1740 he opened a <em>collegium nobilium</em> at <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, a most important experiment. In the first year he had but one pupil, in the second there were more than ten, while in the third he had not room for all who came. The teachers he had instructed now began to help him in writing school-books, etc. In 1754 he built a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> and obtained from <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> a change in the rule of the order: henceforth every <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarist</a> was to be a teacher. There were soon as many <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> as <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarist</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was no longer a privilege of the nobility alone. The classics, history and geography, natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, Roman and Polish law, were taught, together with the modern languages; and for the first time the Polish tongue was taught as a separate subject. Mental, rather than purely mnemonic, work was encouraged; moral <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was insisted upon; emulation succeeded to fear; self-sacrifice, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, patriotism were inculcated as the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of a citizen. Konarski had found theatricals in use; he maintained the custom, thinking these performances might become very instructive, had <a href="../cathen/12630b.htm">Racine</a> and <a href="../cathen/04374b.htm">Corneille</a> performed, and himself wrote a tragedy, "Epaminondas". He also introduced discussions and debating <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> for advanced pupils. Together with this, he laboured to reform style in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, wrote "De emendandis eloquenti vitiis", and attacked the bad taste prevalent at the time. The <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarist</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> succeeded so well that all others were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to follow his reform. Konarski was subjected to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> attacks, and the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">Papal nuncio</a>, Durini, suspected his <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. He cleared himself by his book, "De religione honestorum hominum".

<p>Having effected a complete reformation in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, he returned to politics. From 1760 to 1763 appeared his "Effective Way of Deliberating", which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the right of one member to veto the proceedings of the whole Diet had never been a law, but an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> custom, and showed from the procedure of other parliaments that a working majority was sufficient. The impression made by this work was immense, and even the most bigoted partisans of the veto were convinced. Thenceforward this custom was doomed-in itself a great step forward and a preliminary to the constitution of the Third of May. But the book contains many other valuable <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. His style is clear, calm, eloquent, rarely passionate. He did much for the <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarist</a> publications (v.g. the "Diplomatic Codex"), and the "Volumina Legum" is his work. A great admirer of French civilization and taste &#151; which, however, were not without danger in their tendencies, as was subsequently seen &#151; he was also the last Latin writer in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>; his "Opera Lyrica" (1767) are perfect in style and diction. King Stanislaus Augustus caused a medal to be struck in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, with the well-merited inscription, "Sapere auso".
