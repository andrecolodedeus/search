<h1>Stanislaus and John Kozmian</h1>  

<p>Two brothers who took part in the Polish insurrection of 1831, and subsequently fled the country. Stanislaus settled in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, studied its institutions, and strove to make both nations, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, acquainted with each other. John lived in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, was <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in spreading <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, and, when his wife died, became a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Later he went to Posen, and, as editor of the "Posen Review", became the centre of religious and political life there; Stanislaus aided him in his work and, returning to Posen, became president of the Society of Friends of Science. Both were ardent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, able reformers, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a> politicians, and had minds of exceptional power.
<h2>Stanislaus Kozmian</h2>

<p>(b. in 1811; d. in 1885)

<p>When a student at <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, had written some poetry, very romantic but only of average worth; later, in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, he set to translating <a href="../cathen/13748c.htm">Shakespeare</a>, a work which occupied him for thirty years, and was not complete at his death; he also translated poems by Byron, <a href="../cathen/10553b.htm">Moore</a>, Southey, Shelley, Cowper, and especially the splendid passages of Campbell on <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. He was secretary to the Society of Friends of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and in close relation with Lord Dudley Stuart. His translations of <a href="../cathen/13748c.htm">Shakespeare</a>, though naturally not perfect, are as good as those in any other language. Of his original work, the poem best known in his days was entitled "To the Masters of the Word", addressed to <a href="../cathen/10283a.htm">Mickiewicx</a>, <a href="../cathen/08698b.htm">Krasinski</a>, and Zaleski in 1846. He especially worshipped and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> <a href="../cathen/08698b.htm">Krasinski</a>, two of whose books ("The Day of To-Day" and "The Last One") first appeared as Koxmian's, as the author would not otherwise have published them. Their success put Kolmian in a very <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and painful position, which he described in one of his poems&mdash;an imitation of <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante's</a> "Inferno". Several other poems of a patriotic and religious tendency are also deserving of notice. His prose consists mainly of essays, many of which were published together in two volumes under the title "England and <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>". The first volume contains important information for the writer on that period of Polish history: what the English thought, what they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, how far their friendly feeling went, why the majority of the nation were indifferent to what might befall <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and so on. The second was interesting for the contemporary Polish reader, giving particulars of English institutions, life, politics, and literature&mdash;in the last respect nothing so good has since appeared in Polish. But it is impossible to notice separately all the multitudinous short articles that he wrote, those which deal with literary criticism are especially admirable. He was a practical man of action, a born journalist unpopular indeed, because, being a fervent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, he condemned conspiracies and did not confound revolution with a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> for independence. He lived and died comparatively unknown.
<h2>John Kozmian</h2>

<p>Born in 1812, died in 1877. As <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and author he wrote for upwards of twenty years in the "Posen Review"; his articles have been collected in three volumes (1881). Specially noteworthy are the programme of the Review, "That she may fulfil her mission, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> <em>must</em> be united to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>"; "The Two Idolatries", i.e., Revolutionism and Panslavism, and his last essay, "Duties are permanent." He also wrote a great deal about Italian affairs and in favor of the Temporal Power. We may also mention a controversial essay with the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/06334a.htm">F. Gagarin</a> (a Russian convert), who maintained that the great obstacle to the conversion of the Russians is that they identify <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> and <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. His literary articles are not numerous. He also wrote funeral orations. He and his brother were the first secular workers for the revival of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> convictions in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>.
