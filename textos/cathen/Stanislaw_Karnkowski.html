<h1>Stanislaw Karnkowski</h1>  

<p>(Karncovious.)

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> and <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, born about 1526; died at Lowicz, in the Government of <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, 25 May (<em>al.</em>, 8 June), 1603. As early as 1563 (according to <a href="../cathen/06376a.htm">Gams</a> not until 1568) he was named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Wlozlawsk (Wladislavia, Kalisch), and rendered great service to religion and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> by founding, besides several <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in his episcopal residence. By order of the Synod of Petrikau (1577), he made a new collection of synodal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> under the title "Constitutiones synodorum metrolpitanae ecclesiae Gnesnensis provincialium" (Krakow, 1579). His political and religious influence in contemporary <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> was great. Under King Sigismund II August (1548-72) the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> made great progress in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, especially the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> teaching, while the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> and <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinians</a> bitterly opposed each other. When Sigismund died, Henry of Valois, later Henry III of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, was elected King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. On his entry into Meseritz, Karnkowski welcomed him in the name of the Polish estates. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> also attended the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> (1574), and tried to keep the throne new king in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, but in the same year the French throne fell vacant and he returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Karnkowski then urged the election of Stephen B&aacute;thori, Prince of <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>. The latter was suspected of favouring the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, but under the influence of Karnkowski he declared openly for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> king 1 May, 1576, by Karnkowski, as Uchanski, <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>, had refused to crown him.

<p>Uchanski died 5 April, 1581, and Karnkowski was named his successor in the same year (21 April) in the archiepiscopal See of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> and Primacy of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>; as such, he governed <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> after the death of Stephen B&aacute;thori (12 Dec., 1586). Eventually he succeeded in electing as king Sigismund III Vasa (1587-1632). Through this young king, formerly Crown Prince of Sweden, and reared a good <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> by his mother Katharina, Karnkowski hoped to stay the progress of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. After <a href="../cathen/07473a.htm">Cardinal Hosius</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was the most prominent opponent of the Polish <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. He favoured the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in every way, built a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for them at Kalisch, and a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>. He established an institute for twelve noble students, which is still extant, under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>. It was he who urged the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Jacob Wujek to translate the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> into Polish; this translation was approved by the pope and is still regarded as a classic (Sommervogel, "Bibl. de la C. de J.", VIII, 1234 sp.). Karnkowski wrote several important works, mostly <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>; among them are: "Eucharistia", forty discourses in Polish on the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> (Krakow, 1602); Polish Sermons on the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> or the Redemption (Krakow, 1597); "De jure provinciali terrarum civitatumque Prussiae" (Krakow, 1574); "Liber epistolarum familiarium et illustrium virorum" (Krakow, 1584). He is buried in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> church at Kalisch.
