<h1>States of the Church</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/08245a.htm">Italian</a> <em>Lo Stato della Chiese</em>)

<p>Consists of the civil territory which for over 1000 years (754-1870) acknowledged the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as temporal ruler. The expression "Patrimonium Sancti Petri" originally designated the landed possessions and revenues of various kinds that belonged to the Church of St. Peter at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Until the middle of the eighth century this consisted wholly of private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, but the term was later applied to the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and more particularly to the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Our subject may thus be conveniently treated under the following heads: I. Patrimony of St. Peter (tracing the origin of the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to the time of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>); II. History of the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Patrimony of St. Peter</h2>
<h3 id="A">Patrimonial possessions of the Church of Rome</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a> (321), by which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> was declared qualified to hold and transmit <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, first gave a legal basis to the possessions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Subsequently the possessions were rapidly augmented by donations. Constantine himself set the example, the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran Palace</a> being most probably presented by him. Constantine's gifts formed the historical nucleus, which the Sylvester Legend later surrounded with that network of myth, that gave rise to the forged document known as the <a href="../cathen/05118a.htm">"Donation of Constantine"</a>. The example of Constantine was followed by wealthy <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the Roman nobility, whose memory frequently survived, after the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> themselves had become extinct, in the names of the properties which they had once presented to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a>.

<p>The donation of large estates ceased about 600. The Byzantine emperors subsequently were less liberal in their gifts; the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with the Lombards likewise had an unfavourable effect, and there remained few <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> in a position to bequeath large estates. Apart from a number of scattered possessions in the Orient, <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>, <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, and Africa, the patrimonies were naturally for the most part situated in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and on the adjacent islands. The most valuable and most extensive possessions were those in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, about <a href="../cathen/14395b.htm">Syracuse</a> and Palermo. The revenues from the properties in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and Lower <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in the eighth century, when Leo the Isaurian confiscated them, were estimated at three and one-half talents of gold. But the patrimonies in the vicinity of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were the most numerous and, after most of the remote patrimonies had been lost in the eighth century, were managed with especial care. Of other patrimonies may be mentioned the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> with the Island of Capri, that of <a href="../cathen/06333a.htm">Gaeta</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscan</a>, the <em>Patrimonium Tiburtinum</em> in the vicinity of <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tivoli</a>, estates about <a href="../cathen/11351c.htm">Otranto</a>, <a href="../cathen/11338a.htm">Osimo</a>, <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona, Umana</a>, estates near <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> and <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, and lastly properties in Istria, <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>.

<p>With these landed possessions, scattered and varied as they were, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was the largest landowner in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. For this reason every ruler of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was compelled of necessity to reckon with him first of all; on the other hand he was also the first to feel the political and economical disturbances that distressed the country. A good insight into the problems that required the attention of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the administration of his patrimonies can be obtained from the letters of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> (Mon. Germ. Epist., I). The revenues from the patrimonies were employed, not only for administrative purposes, for the maintenance and construction of church edifices, for the equipment of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, for the household of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and the support of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, but also to a great extent to relieve public and private want. Numerous poorhouses, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, and hospices for <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> were maintained out of the revenues of the patrimonies, many <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> were supported directly or indirectly, and slaves were ransomed from the possession of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>. But, above all, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> relieved the emperors of the responsibility of providing <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with food, and later also assumed the task of warding off the Lombards, an undertaking generally involving financial <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>, The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> thus became the champion of all the oppressed, the political champion of all those who were unwilling to submit to foreign domination, who were unwilling to become Lombards or yet wholly <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a>, preferring to remain Romans.
<h3 id="B">Political position of the papacy</h3>

<p>This political aspect of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> became in time very prominent, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, after the removal of the imperial residence to the East, was no longer the seat of any of the higher political officials. Even after the partition of the empire, the Western emperors preferred to make the better-protected <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> their residence. Here was the centre of Odoacer's power and of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogothic</a> rule; here also, after the fall of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogoths</a>, the viceroy of the Byzantine emperor in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a>, resided. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> appears with ever-increasing frequency as the advocate of the needy population; thus <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a> intercedes with <a href="../cathen/02061b.htm">Attila</a> and Geiserich, and Gelasius with <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>. <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> as <em>pr&oelig;fectus pr&oelig;torio</em> under the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogothic</a> supremacy actually entrusted the care of the temporal affairs to <a href="../cathen/08421b.htm">Pope John II</a>. When Emperor Justinian issued the <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a> (554), the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> together with the Senate was entrusted with the control of weights and measures. Thenceforth for two centuries the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> were most loyal supporters of the Byzantine Government against the encroachments of the Lombards, and were all the more indispensable, because after 603 the Senate disappeared. They, too, were the only court of judicature at which the Roman population, exposed as it was to the extortion of the Byzantine functionaries and officers, could find protection and defence. No wonder then that at scarcely any other time was the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> so popular in Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and there was no cause which the native population, who had again begun to organise themselves into bodies of militia, espoused with greater <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> then the freedom and independence of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a>. And naturally so, for they took part in the election of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as a separate electoral body.



<p>When the Byzantine emperors, infected with c&aelig;saro-papist tendencies, attempted to crush the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> also, they found in the Roman militia an opposition against which they were able to accomplish nothing. The particularism of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> awoke and concentrated itself about the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. When Emperor Justinian II in 692 attempted to have <a href="../cathen/13728c.htm">Pope Sergius II</a> (as formerly the unfortunate <a href="../cathen/09723c.htm">Martin I</a>) forcibly conveyed to Constantinople to extract from him his assent to the canons of the <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Trullan Council</a>, convoked by the emperor, the militia of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> and of the Duchy of Pentapolis lying immediately to the south assembled, marched into <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and compelled the departure of the emperor's plenipotentiary. Such occurrences were repeated and acquired significance as indicating the popular feeling. When Pope Constantine, the last <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to go to Constantinople (710), rejected the confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the new emperor, Bardanas, the Romans protested, and refused to acknowledge the emperor or the <em>dux</em> (military ruler) sent by him. Not until news was brought that the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> emperor had been replaced by one of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith was the <em>dux</em> allowed to assume his office. That was in 713. Two years later the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chair, which had last been occupied by seven Oriental <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, was filled by a Roman, <a href="../cathen/06787a.htm">Gregory II</a>, who was destined to oppose Leo III the Isaurian in the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclastic conflict</a>. The time was ripening for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to abandon the East, turn toward the West, and enter into that alliance with the Germano-Romanic nations, on which is based our Western civilization, of which one consequence was the formation of the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It would have been easy for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> to throw off the Byzantine yoke in Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> as early as the time of <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclasm</a>. If they resisted the impulse, it was because they correctly recognized that such an attempt would have been premature. They foresaw that the end of the Byzantine supremacy and the beginning of the Lombard power would have been encompassed at the same time. It was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> first to establish the fact that the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> could no longer protect the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the Romans against the Lombards, and then to find a power that could protect them. Both of these conditions were fulfilled in the middle of the eighth century.
<h3 id="C">Collapse of the Byzantine power in central Italy</h3>

<p>The strange shape which the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were destined to assume from the beginning is explained by the fact that these were the districts in which the population of Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> had defended itself to the very last against the Lombards. The two chief districts were the country about <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, the exarchate, where the <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a> was the centre of the opposition, and the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which embraced the lands of Roman <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> north of the Tiber and to the south the Campagna as far as the Garigliano, where the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself was the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the opposition. Furthermore, the greatest pains were taken, as long as it was at all possible, to retain control of the intervening districts and with them communication over the Apennines. Hence the strategic importance of the Duchy of the Pentapolis (Rimini, <a href="../cathen/11738b.htm">Pesaro</a>, <a href="../cathen/05785a.htm">Fano</a>, <a href="../cathen/14013a.htm">Sinigaglia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>) and <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>. If this strategic connexion were broken, it was evident that <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> could not singly maintain themselves for any length of time. This was recognized by the Lombards also. The same narrow strip of land in fact broke the connexion between their Duchies of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> and <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> and the main portion of the king's territories in the north, and it was against this therefore that, from the second decade of the eighth century, they aimed their attacks with ever-increasing energy. In the beginning the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> were able repeatedly to wrest from their hands all that they had gained. In 728 the Lombard king Liutprand took the Castle of Sutri, which dominated the highway at Nepi on the road to <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>. But Liutprand, softened by the entreaties of <a href="../cathen/06787a.htm">Pope Gregory II</a>, restored Sutri "as a gift to the blessed Apostles Peter and Paul". This expression of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber pontificalis"</a> was <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> interpreted to mean that in this gift the beginning of the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was to be recognized. This is incorrect inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> continued to acknowledge the imperial Government, and Greek officials appear in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for some time longer. True it is, however, that here for the first time we meet the <a href="../cathen/02004a.htm">association of ideas</a> on which the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were to be constructed. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> asked the Lombards for the return of Sutri for the sake of the Princes of the Apostles and threatened punishment by these sainted protectors. The <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Liutprand was undoubtedly susceptible to such pleas, but never to any consideration for the Greeks. For this reason he gave Sutri to Peter and Paul, that he might not expose himself to their punishment. What the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> then did with it would be immaterial to him.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that the Roman territory (at first in the more restricted, but afterwards also in the wider sense) was defended by the Princes of the Apostles became more and more prevalent. In 738 the Lombard duke Transamund of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> captured the Castle of Gallese, which protected the road to <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> to the north of Nepi. By the payment of a large sum of money <a href="../cathen/06789a.htm">Gregory III</a> induced the duke to restore the castle to him. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> then sought by an alliance with Duke Transamund to protect himself against Liutprand. But Liutprand conquered <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, besieged <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, laid waste the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and seized four important frontier fortresses (Blera, Orte, Bomarzo, and Amelia), thereby cutting off the communication with <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> and <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. In this exigency the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> now (739) for the first time turned to the powerful <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom, under the protection of which <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a> had begun his successful labours as a missionary in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. He sent to <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a>, "the powerful mayor of the palace" of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> monarchy and the commander of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> in the famous battle at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, undoubtedly with the consent of the Greek <em>dux</em>, and appealed to him to protect the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the Apostle. <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a> replied to the embassy and acknowledged the gifts, but was unwilling to offer aid against the Lombards, who were helping him against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. Accordingly the successor of <a href="../cathen/06789a.htm">Gregory III</a>, Zacharias (the last Greek who occupied the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chair) changed the policy that had been previously followed toward the Lombards. He formed an alliance with Liutprand against Transamund, and received (741) in return the four castles. This Zacharias obtained as the result of a personal visit to the camp of the king at <a href="../cathen/10704a.htm">Terni</a>. Liutprand also restored a number of patrimonies that had been seized by the Lombards, and furthermore concluded a twenty years' peace with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The duchy now had a respite from Lombard attacks. The Lombards fell upon <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, which they had already held from 731 to 735. The <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a> had no other recourse than to seek the aid of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Liutprand did in fact allow himself to be induced by Zacharias to surrender the greater part of his conquests. Nor was it unimportant that these districts too once owed their rescue to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Only a short time after Liutprand's death (744) Zacharias was successful in further postponing the catastrophe. When Rachis, the Lombard king, was besieging <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> (749), Zacharias so wrought upon his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> that the king raised the siege. But as a result of this Rachis was overthrown, and <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">Aistulf</a>, who was put into his place, at once showed by his acts that no consideration could halt him in his course.

<p>In 751 <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">Aistulf</a> conquered <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, and thereby decided the long delayed fate of the exarchate and the Pentapolis. And when <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">Aistulf</a>, who held <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> also under his immediate sway, directed all his might against the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, it seemed that this too could no longer be held. Byzantium could send no troops, and Emperor Constantine V Copronymus, in answer to the repeated requests for help of the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/14288c.htm">Stephen II</a>, could only offer him the advice to act in accordance with the ancient policy of Byzantium, to pit some other Germanic tribe against the Lombards. The <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> alone were powerful enough to compel the Lombards to maintain peace, and they alone stood in close relationship with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a> had on a former occasion failed to respond to the entreaties of <a href="../cathen/06789a.htm">Gregory III</a>. But meanwhile the relations between the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> rulers and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> had become more intimate. <a href="../cathen/15743b.htm">Pope Zacharias</a> had only recently (751), at Pepin's accession to the throne, spoken the word that removed all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> in favour of the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> mayor of the palace. It was not unreasonable, therefore, to expect an active show of gratitude in return, when <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was most grievously pressed by <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">Aistulf</a>. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/14288c.htm">Stephen II</a> secretly sent a letter to Pepin by <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, soliciting his aid against <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">Aistulf</a> and asking for a conference. Pepin in turn sent Abbot Droctegang of Jumi&egrave;ges to confer with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and a little later dispatched Duke Autchar and Bishop Chrodengang of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> to conduct the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> realm. Never before had a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> crossed the Alps. While Pope Stephen was preparing for the journey, a messenger arrived from Constantinople, bringing to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the imperial mandate to treat once more with <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">Aistulf</a> for the purpose of persuading him to surrender his conquests. Stephen took with him the imperial messenger and several dignitaries of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, as well, as members of the aristocracy belonging to the Roman militia, and proceeded first of all to <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">Aistulf</a>. In 753 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">Aistulf</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> met him at <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, refused to enter into negotiations or to hear of a restoration of his conquests. Only with difficulty did Stephen finally prevail upon the Lombard king not to hinder him in his journey to the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom.
<h3 id="D">Intervention of the Franks. Formation of the States of the Church.</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> thereupon crossed the Great St. Bernard into the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom. Pepin received his guest at Ponthion, and there promised him orally to do all in his power to recover the Exarchate of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> and the other districts seized by <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">Aistulf</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> then went to St-Denis near <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he concluded a firm alliance of friendship with the first <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> king, probably in January, 754. He anointed King Pepin, his wife, and sons, and bound the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> under the threat of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> never thereafter to choose their kings from any other <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> than the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a>. At the same time he bestowed on Pepin and his sons the title of "Patrician of the Romans", which title, the highest Byzantine officials in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the exarchs, had borne. Instead of the latter the King of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> was now to be the protector of the Romans. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in bestowing this title probably acted also in conformity with authority conferred on him by the Byzantine emperor. In order, however, to fulfil the wishes of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> Pepin had eventually to obtain the consent of his nobles to a campaign into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. This was rendered imperative, when several embassies, which attempted by peaceful means to induce the Lombard king to give up his conquests, returned without accomplishing their mission. At Quiercy on the Oise the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> nobles finally gave their consent. There Pepin executed in writing a promise to give to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> certain territories, the first documentary record for the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This document, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, has not been preserved in the authentic version, but a number of citations, quoted from it during the decades immediately following, indicate its contents, and it is likely that it was the source of the much interpolated "Fragmentum Fantuzzianum", which probably dates from 778-80. In the original document of Quiercy Pepin promised the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the restoration of the lands of Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, which had been last conquered by <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">Aistulf</a>, especially in the exarchate and in the Roman Duchy, and of a number of more or less clearly defined patrimonies in the Lombard Kingdom and in the Duchies of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> and <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>. The lands were not yet in Pepin's hands. They had therefore first to be conquered by Pepin, and his gift was conditioned by this event. In the summer of 754 Pepin with his army and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> began their march into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and forced <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">King Aistulf</a>, who had shut himself up in his capital, to sue for peace. The Lombard promised to give up the cities of the exarchate and of the Pentapolis, which had been last conquered, to make no further attacks upon or to evacuate the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the districts of Venetia and Istria, and acknowledged the sovereignty of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>. For the cities in the exarchate and in the Pentapolis, which <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">Aistulf</a> promised to return, Pepin executed a separate deed for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. This is the first actual "Donation of 754". But Pepin had hardly recrossed the Alps on his return home, when <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">Aistulf</a> not only failed to make preparations for the return of the promised cities, but again advanced against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which had to endure a severe siege. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> sent a messenger by sea, summoning Pepin to fulfil anew his pledge of loyalty. In 756 Pepin again set out with an army against <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">Aistulf</a> and a second time hemmed him in at Pavia. <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">Aistulf</a> was again compelled to promise to deliver to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the cities granted him after the first <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and, in addition, Commachio at the mouth of the Po. But this time the mere promise was not considered sufficient. Messengers of Pepin visited the various cities of the exarchate and of the Pentapolis, demanded and received the keys to them, and brought the highest magistrates and most distinguished magnates of these cities to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Pepin executed a new deed of gift for the cities thus surrendered to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, which together with the keys of the cities were deposited on the grave of St. Peter (Second Donation of 756).

<p>The Byzantine Government naturally did not approve of this result of the intervention of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>. It had hoped through the instrumentality of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> to regain possession of the districts that had been wrested from it by the Lombards. But Pepin took up arms, not to render a service to the Byzantine emperor, but for the sake of St. Peter alone, from whose protection he expected earthly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and everlasting <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Just as kings at that time founded <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and endowed them with landed properties, that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> might be offered for them there, so Pepin wished to provide the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with temporal territories, that he might be certain of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Therefore Pepin answered the Byzantine ambassadors, who came to him before the second expedition of 756 and asked him to return to the emperor the cities to be taken from the Lombards, that he had undertaken the expedition for St. Peter alone and not for the emperor; that to St. Peter alone would he restore the cities. Thus did Pepin found the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The Greeks undoubtedly had the formal right to the sovereignty, but as they had failed to meet the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of sovereignty to give protection against foreign enemies, their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> became illusory. If the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> had not interfered, the territory would by right of conquest have fallen to the Lombards; Pepin by his intervention prevented <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the native population from falling into the hands of the foreign conquerors. The States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are in a certain sense the only remnant of the Roman Empire in the West which escaped foreign conquerors. Gratefully did the Roman population acknowledge that they had escaped subjection to the Lombards only through the mediation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. For it was only for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> sake that Pepin had resolved to interfere. The results were important,

<ul><li>chiefly because the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> through his temporal sovereignty received a guarantee of his independence, was freed from the fetters of a temporal power, and obtained that freedom from interference which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the conduct of his high office; <li>because the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> threw off the political ties that bound it to the East and entered into new relations with the West, which made possible the development of the new Western civilization.</ul>

<p>The latter was destined to become especially prominent under Pepin's son, <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>.

<p>Under <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> the relations with the Lombards soon became strained again. <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Adrian I</a> complained that the Lombard king Desiderius had invaded the territories of the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and reminded <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> of the promise made at Quiercy. As Desiderius also championed the claims of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> nephews, he endangered the unity of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom, and <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> own interests therefore bade him to oppose Desiderius. In the autumn of 773 <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> entered <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and besieged Desiderius at Pavia. While the siege was in progress, <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 774, and at the request of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> renewed the promises made at Quiercy. Soon after this Desiderius was forced to capitulate, and <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> had himself proclaimed King of the Lombards in his place. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> attitude toward the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> now underwent a change. With the title of King of the Lombards he also assumed the title as "Patricius Romanorum", which his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> had never used, and read into this title <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> which under Pepin had never been associated with it. Moreover, differences of opinion arose between Adrian and <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> which had been assumed by Pepin and <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> in the document of Quiercy. Adrian construed it to mean that <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> should take an elastic concept of the "respublica Romana" to the extent of giving up not only the conquests of <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">Aistulf</a> in the exarchate and in the Pentapolis, but also earlier conquests of the Lombards in Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>. But Charles would not listen to any such interpretation of the document. As both parties were anxious to come to an understanding, an agreement was reached in 781. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> acknowledged the sovereignty of Adrian in the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and in the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> founded by Pepin's donations of 754-56. He now executed a new document in which were enumerated all the districts in which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was recognized as ruler. The Duchy of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (which had not been mentioned in the earlier documents) heads the list, followed by the exarchate and the Pentapolis, augmented by the cities which Desiderius had agreed to surrender at the beginning of his reign (Imola, Bologna, <a href="../cathen/05751b.htm">Faenza</a>, <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, <a href="../cathen/11338a.htm">Osimo</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Umana</a>); next the patrimonies were specified in various groups: in the Sabine, in the Spoletan and Beneventan districts, in Calabria, in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, however, in his character as "Patricius", wanted to be considered as the highest court of appeal in criminal cases in the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He promised on the other hand to protect freedom of choice in the election of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and renewed the alliance of friendship that had been previously made between Pepin and <a href="../cathen/14288c.htm">Stephen II</a>.

<p>The agreement between <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> and Adrian remained undisturbed. In 787 <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> still further enlarged the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by new donations: <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a> and a few other frontier cities of the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, besides several cities in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, Populonia, Roselle, <a href="../cathen/14165b.htm">Sovana</a>, <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Toscanella</a>, <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, <a href="../cathen/02203c.htm">Bagnorea</a>, <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>, Ferento, Orchia, Marta, and lastly Citt&agrave; di Castello appear to have been added at that time. All of this, of course, is based upon painstaking deductions, since no document has come down to us either from the time of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> or from that of Pepin. Adrian in these negotiations proved himself no mean politician, and is justly ranked with <a href="../cathen/14288c.htm">Stephen II</a> as the second founder of the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. His arrangements with <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> remained authoritative for the relations of the later <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> with the Carlovingians and the German emperors. These relations were given a brilliant outward expression by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> as emperor in 800.
<h2 id="section2">States of the Church</h2>
<h3 id="A">The period of the Carlovingian Emperors</h3>

<p>The States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> founded by the Carlovingians were the security for the friendly alliance between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the empire which dominated the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. But this friendly alliance also was and remained the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> condition for the existence of the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Without the protection of the great power beyond the Alps the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> could not have been maintained. The worst dangers threatened the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, not so much from foreign enemies, as from the factions of the nobility in the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, who were continually engaged in jealous quarrels, each striving to get control of the spiritual and temporal power attaching to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. The degradation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> reached its lowest point when it could obtain no protection from the empire against the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> for power of the factions of the Roman nobility or of the neighbouring patrician <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. This <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> for power manifested itself principally at the election of a new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. For this reason the emperors, when they assumed the responsibility of protecting the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, also guaranteed a canonical election, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> laid great stress upon having this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> renewed in writing by each new emperor in the confirmation of the old charters. Of these charters the oldest whose text is preserved is the "Hludovicianum" or <em>Pactum</em> of Louis the Pious, i.e. the instrument executed by that monarch for Paschal I in 817. With Paschal's successor, <a href="../cathen/05598b.htm">Eugene II</a>, the friendly alliance was, by order of Louis, renewed in 824 by his eldest son and colleague in the empire, Lothair I. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, dependent on the protection of the emperor, then granted the emperor new <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, which mark the zenith of the imperial influence under the Carlovingians. The emperor received the right of supervising the government and the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> through the instrumentality of permanent envoys, and no new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> until he had, together with the Romans, taken the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance to the emperor in the presence of imperial envoys.

<p>In this way the empire received in the "Constitution of Lothair" an indirect influence over the election of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and a supervision of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> government in the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But soon after this the Carlovingians were so busily occupied by their dynastic quarrels that they had but little time to concern themselves about <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Leo IV</a> had, in concert with some seaport towns of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, to take measures personally for the defence of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. The soldiers blessed by him won a brilliant victory at <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> in 849. As the right bank of the Tiber with its <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Basilica of St. Peter</a> was exposed to the pillage of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, Leo fortified it with a wall (848-52), and in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the part of the city so protected was called <em>Civitas Leonina</em>. In 850 Leo <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> Lothair's son, Louis II, as emperor. Although this emperor <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravely</a> opposed the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> in Lower <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> with all his power, this power was no longer that of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, for Louis's rule extended only over <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. To the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, then represented by <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a>, the regency of Louis II was at times a danger rather than a protection. His representative, Duke Lambert of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, under the pretence of superintending the election of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, invaded <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 867, and treated it as conquered territory. This was the prelude to the wretched period following the death of Louis (875), when <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> were placed at the mercy of the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> lords, who had come into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> with the Carlovingians, and who now quarrelled first with the Carlovingians still ruling beyond the Alps, then among themselves for the apple of discord, the imperial crown. In vain did the able <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">Pope John VIII</a> hope for help and protection from the West Frankish king, Charles the Bald, who had been <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor in 875. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Charles renewed the old charter relative to protection and donations and increased the domain of the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by new donations (Spoleto and <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>); he also gave up the claim to have envoys present at the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as well as the assignment to these envoys of the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. But beyond these donations on paper he did nothing. <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a>, at the head of his fleet at Cape Circeo (877), had to defend himself unaided against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. Fleeing from the dukes Lambert of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> and Adalbert of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, who bore themselves as representatives of the imperial power, he went to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, vainly imploring the Carlovingians for help. The East Frank, Charles the Fat, who received the imperial crown from <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a> in 881, likewise did nothing, and Arnulf, who was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor in 896, was compelled by illness to suspend further interference. Severely did the defenceless <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> have to suffer for having summoned him. <a href="../cathen/14289c.htm">Pope Stephen V</a> had previously (891) yielded to the urging of Duke Guido of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> and bestowed on him the imperial crown. Stephen's successor, Pope Formosus, had been compelled to give the crown also to Guido's son, Lambert as the associate of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> in the empire (892); he thus incurred the fierce <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of Lambert, when he afterwards summoned Arnulf to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> him emperor. When Lambert, after the death of Formosus, entered <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 897, he took a horrible revenge upon the corpse of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> through the medium of Stephen VI.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> was now completely at the mercy of the struggling factions of the nobility. <a href="../cathen/02428a.htm">Benedict IV</a> in 901 <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> as emperor Louis, King of Lower <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, who had been summoned by the Italian nobles. In 915 <a href="../cathen/08425b.htm">John X</a> <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> Louis's opponent, the Marquis Berengar of Friuli. Berengar was the last to receive the imperial crown before the founding of the Roman Empire of the German Nation. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself the greatest influence was won by the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the later Counts of Tusculum, which traced its descent to the senator and <em>dux</em>, Theophylactus, and whose power was for a time represented by the wife of Theophylactus, Theodora (called <em>Senatrix</em> or <em>Vesteratrix</em>), and her daughters Marozia and Theodora the Younger. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> also came under the power of these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Alberic, the husband of Marozia, with <a href="../cathen/08425b.htm">John X</a>, who had been raised to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> by the elder Theodora, defeated the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> on the Gangliano (916), and thereafter called himself Consul of the Romans. After his death this rank was transmitted to Marozia, and, on her fall, to his son Alberic. Marozia had <a href="../cathen/08425b.htm">John X</a> deposed, and finally had her own son by her first husband placed upon the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chair as <a href="../cathen/08426a.htm">John XI</a>. <a href="../cathen/08426a.htm">John XI</a> was entirely dominated by his mother. When Marozia's son, Alberic II, finally put an end to the despotic rule of his mother (932), the Romans proclaimed him their lord and master, conferred on him all temporal power, and restricted the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> authority to purely spiritual matters. Alberic, who had a palace on the Aventine, refused the German king <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a> permission to enter <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, when the latter appeared in Upper <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in 951. But, when Otto appeared for the second time in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, conditions had changed.
<h3 id="B">From the coronation of Otto I as emperor to the end of the Hohenstaufen line</h3>

<p>Alberic II died in 954. In accordance with a promise made to him, the Romans in 955 elected to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> as <a href="../cathen/08426b.htm">John XII</a> his seventeen-year-old son Octavian, who had succeeded him in the temporal power. This pontiff thus united the spiritual and temporal power, but only in the territory which had been subject to Alberic &mdash; that is substantially the old Duchy of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, or the "Patrimonium Petri". The Pentapolis and the exarchate were in other hands, ultimately falling to King Berengar of <a href="../cathen/08258a.htm">Ivrea</a>. To obtain protection against Berengar, <a href="../cathen/08426b.htm">John XII</a> called upon <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a> for help. Otto came and on 2 February, 962, received the imperial crown. On 13 February he drew up the charter (still extant in a contemporary calligraphic copy, preserved in the archives of the Vatican), in which he renewed the well-known covenants of his predecessors, increased the donations by the addition of several new ones, and undertook to secure the canonical election of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was not to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> until imperial envoys had assured themselves of the legality of the election and obtained from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a sworn promise of allegiance (cf. Th. Sickel, "Das Privilegium Ottos I f&uuml;r die romische Kirche", Innsbruck, 1883). The <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> condition for the co&ouml;peration of emperor and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was their common opposition to Berengar. This was removed when <a href="../cathen/08426b.htm">John XII</a>, who not unreasonably feared Otto's power, entered into secret negotiations with Berengar. Otto thereupon again came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had left, and demanded of the Romans an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> that henceforth they would never again elect a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> without the express consent and sanction of the emperor. Therewith the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> was declared subject to the emperor. This at once became evident, when a synod, over which Otto presided, deposed the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09160b.htm">Leo VIII</a>, who was chosen in accordance with Otto's wishes, was unable to remain at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> without Otto. The Romans, after the death of <a href="../cathen/08426b.htm">John XII</a>, elected <a href="../cathen/02428b.htm">Benedict V</a>, but Otto sent him into exile at <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>. Other afflictions beset <a href="../cathen/08427a.htm">John XIII</a>, to secure whose elevation the Romans and Otto had acted in harmony in 966. John needed the protection of the emperor against a rebellious faction of the nobility, whereupon Otto appointed a prefect of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and enfeoffed him with drawn sword. In return the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> the son of <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a> (<a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a>) with the imperial crown in the next year (967), and later married him to the Greek princess Theophano. <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a> had to render the same protection to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of his time. <a href="../cathen/08427a.htm">John XIII's</a> successor, <a href="../cathen/02428c.htm">Benedict VI</a>, was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> in the Castle of S. Angelo by hostile nobles. The <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frank</a> who was chosen in his place (<a href="../cathen/02661c.htm">Boniface VII</a>) had to flee to Constantinople, but the position of <a href="../cathen/02428d.htm">Benedict VII</a>, who was raised to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> with the consent of <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a>, remained uncertain until Otto in 980 came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where, after his defeat near Capo Colonne, he died (983) and was buried in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. <a href="../cathen/02661c.htm">Boniface VII</a>, who returned from Constantinople, had during the minority of Otto's son displaced <a href="../cathen/08427b.htm">John XIV</a>, the successor of <a href="../cathen/02428d.htm">Benedict VII</a>, and exposed him to death by starvation in the Castle of S. Angelo. And beside <a href="../cathen/08427c.htm">John XV</a>, who was made <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> after the fall of <a href="../cathen/02661c.htm">Boniface VII</a>, the dux, Crescentius, under the usurped title of "Patrician", ruled over <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, so that the times of an Alberic seemed to have returned.

<p>John V therefore earnestly desired the arrival of a German army. It appeared in 996 under the command of the sixteen-year-old <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a>. As John had died before Otto entered <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the German king, whom the Romans had asked to propose a candidate, designated, on the advice of the princes, his relative, the young Bruno, who was then elected at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and graced the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chair as <a href="../cathen/06790a.htm">Gregory V</a> (996-99). Crescentius was besieged in the Castle of S. Angelo and beheaded. <a href="../cathen/06790a.htm">Gregory V</a>, who <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> emperor, was the first German <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. His successor, the first <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, also designated by Otto, was the learned Sylvester II, near whom on the Aventine the emperor desired permanently to make his residence, that he might govern the West as the Roman emperors had once done. The old <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> and a ceremonial fashioned after Byzantine forms were to be put into effect. But these plans soon came to naught. Only a few years later, in 1002, the youthful and visionary emperor, bitterly disillusioned, died in his camp outside <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which had risen against him. And, when Sylvester II also passed away in 1003, <a href="../cathen/04484c.htm">John Crescentius</a>, the son of the Crescentius who had been beheaded by <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a>, having possessed himself of the patriciate, seized the government at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. After his death the Counts of Tusculum began to contend with the Crescentians for the supremacy, and, in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> set up by their opponents, raised one of their own followers to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chair as <a href="../cathen/02428e.htm">Benedict VIII</a>; the latter was recognized as the lawful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by Henry II, whom he <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 14 February, 1014. An intimate friendship united Benedict and Henry. Together they planned a reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which unfortunately was not carried out. Benedict was succeeded by his brother, <a href="../cathen/08429b.htm">John XIX</a>, a man less worthy of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, who had previously held the temporal power in the city, and who as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for the most part thought only of the interests of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. These urged him to gain the good will of Henry's successor, Conrad II, whom he <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1027. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> dignity sank to a still lower level under the nephew of <a href="../cathen/08429b.htm">John XIX</a>, <a href="../cathen/02429a.htm">Benedict IX</a>, whose elevation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne at the age of twenty was secured by his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> through <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. When the Romans set up an <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, Sylvester III, in opposition, Benedict wavered for a time in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether he ought not to resign; finally he relinquished the pontificate to his godfather John Gratian for 1000 pounds of silver. The purchaser had had recourse to this measure only to put an end to the abominable practices of the Tusculan. He called himself <a href="../cathen/06791b.htm">Gregory VI</a>, and stood in friendly relations with the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. But as John again asserted his claims, and all three <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> had evidently secured the dignity only through <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>, the party of reform saw no other remedy than to induce the German king, Henry III, to intervene. Henry III, through the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of Sutri and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, had all three <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> deposed. <a href="../cathen/06791b.htm">Gregory VI</a> in the capacity of secretary went into exile to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> with <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a> (later <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Pope Gregory VII</a>). Then, marking the zenith of the German imperial power at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, there followed a number of German <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>: <a href="../cathen/04017a.htm">Clement II</a>, who <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> Henry III emperor in 1046, conferring on him also the rank of Patrician, and with it the right of <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> at papal elections; Damasus II; <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Saint Leo IX</a> of Alsace, with whom the drift toward <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform finally reached the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chair; and Victor II.

<p>The reaction soon set in. Under the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a> the effort to free the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> from the commanding influence of the empire becomes clearly noticeable. At the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Synod of 1059 the papal election was placed under new regulations; being reposed essentially in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. The German king was no longer to have the right of designation, but at most only that of confirmation. As the German Court was unwilling to yield the right of designation without a struggle, which, according to its concept, was conferred together with the hereditary rank of Patrician, the first conflicts between empire and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> began. In opposition to <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a>, who was elected to succeed <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a>, the German Government set up <a href="../cathen/03128c.htm">Bishop Cadalus of Parma (Honorius II)</a>. Soon afterward, under Henry IV and <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, the conflicts broadened out into the conflict concerning investiture. In this contest the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> had pressing need of a temporal power to support it against the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. This support was destined to be furnished by the Normans, whose state, founded in Lower <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, became of ever-increasing importance to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>.

<p>The relations between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the Normans were not always friendly. When these at the time of <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> advanced into the Lombard Duchy of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, the Beneventans sought to defend themselves against them by expelling the reigning prince and electing the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1051 as their sovereign. Thus was <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> added to the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Actually, of course, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> had possession only of the city of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> with the district immediately under its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and that only since 1077. Through <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> became involved in a quarrel with the Normans and took the field against them, but was defeated and made captive near Civitate in 1053. The victors, however, did not fail to recognize and to respect in the captive the successor of Peter, and subsequently, as the result of negotiations with <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a>, the treaty of Melfi was made in 1059, in which the Normans acknowledged themselves vassals of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for the conquered territories &mdash; <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> was excepted &mdash; and engaged to pay a yearly tribute. They now also took upon themselves the protection of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as well as of the canonical election of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. A Norman army under <a href="../cathen/07072b.htm">Robert Guiscard</a> rescued <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> in the greatest distress, when Henry IV had come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with his <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Clement III</a>, received the imperial crown from the latter, and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> in the Castle of S. Angelo. Before the powerful Norman army Henry had to withdraw from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1084.

<p>A valuable ally of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> in its conflict with the empire was the great Countess Matilda of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, at whose Castle of <a href="../cathen/03298a.htm">Canossa</a> King Henry IV appeared in January, 1077, to beg <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> for <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from the ban of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Matilda had by will bequeathed her freehold estates to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but had also in 1111 made promises to <a href="../cathen/07232a.htm">Emperor Henry V</a>, but probably only in such a way that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> would remain chief owner. The succession to the lands bequeathed by Matilda furnished after her death (1115) a new cause, first for strained relations, then for a quarrel between emperor and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. This was partly due to the fact that the lands, because of their location, had a high strategic value. Whoever possessed them commanded the passage of the Apennines from the plains of the Po into <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. Henry V at once took possession of the lands, and subsequent kings and emperors to <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> also occupied or bestowed them in spite of the repeated protests of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>. Amid all this we often see <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and emperor working in harmony. The <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/01447a.htm">Anacletus II</a> with his protector, King Roger II of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, was attacked by Emperor Lothair, who took up the cause of <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a>. <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick I</a> had <a href="../cathen/01747b.htm">Arnold of Brescia</a>, who had openly preached against the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, executed as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> and rebel (1155).

<p>The various matters of dispute, which had led under <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick I</a> to the eighteen years' conflict with <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> and had been then settled in the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, were again revived when Henry VI, as husband of the Norman heiress Constance, at the death of the childless King William II in 1189, laid claim to the Norman Kingdom, which embraced <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and Lower <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as lord paramount wished to have the unrestricted disposal of the Norman kingdom, and first bestowed it on the <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> Tancred of <a href="../cathen/09107d.htm">Lecce</a>. But Henry disregarded this action and conquered the kingdom after Tancred's death in 1194. He desired to transform <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> into an hereditary monarchy. He also made old parts of the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> subject to him, when in 1195 he placed the Margravate of <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, and the ancient exarchate (the Romagna) under the lord high steward of the realm, Markwald of Anweiler, as his viceroy. But with his death in 1197 all the plans for world dominion collapsed. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> a national movement was started, which the youthful and energetic <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> utilized to reestablish and extend the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. First of all he enforced the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself by exacting an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance from the senators as well as from the prefect, previously appointed by the emperor. After this nearly all the towns and villages of the territory bequeathed by Matilda, in the <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a>, and in the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, also Assisi and <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, submitted to him. <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent</a> thus became the restorer of the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. After the precedent set by <a href="../cathen/11357a.htm">Otto IV</a> (Neuss, 8 June, 1201), the son of Henry VI, <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, who had been protected by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, confirmed anew the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in their constituent parts by a golden bull executed in the name of the empire at Eger on 12 July, 1213: these parts were the old Patrimony from Ceperano to Radicofani, the <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a>, the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, the territories of Matilda, the County of <a href="../cathen/02522c.htm">Bertinoro</a> (south of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>), the exarchate, and the Pentapolis. All these new acquisitions and the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in their entirety were again placed in the greatest jeopardy when the great struggle between <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> broke out, With the exception of the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the emperor had brought the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> into his power. <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> fled to his native city &OElig;cumenical <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> and thence to <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, where at the thirteenth &OElig;cumenical Council in 1245 he placed <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> under the ban of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ann deposed him. The conflict raged for several years longer, but the star of the Hohenstaufen was rapidly setting. The emperors son Enzio, commander-in-chief in Central and Upper <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, was captured by the Bolognese in 1249. The emperor himself died in 1250, and his son Conrad IV died a few years later (1254). When Frederick's <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> son Manfred undertook the continuation of the struggle and had himself <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> at <a href="../cathen/11419b.htm">Palermo</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a> summoned to his aid the brother of <a href="../cathen/09368a.htm">King Louis IX</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Charles of Anjou, who had accepted the Kingdom of Lower <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> an a fief of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Charles vanquished Manfred in 1266 at <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, and Conradin, the youthful nephew of <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, at Tagliacozzo in 1268, and had this last descendant of the Hohenstaufen house executed in the market-place of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. With this the danger to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> from the Hohenstaufen was removed, but a worse danger took its place.
<h3 id="C">From the Avignon Exile to the end of the fifteenth century</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> was now not only dependent upon the protection of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but was also entirely at its mercy. This was seen in the utter disregard shown by <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a> in his attitude toward <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> and his successors. <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, a native of Southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, did not venture to go to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> after his election in 1305, but had himself <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, and after 1309 resided at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, which now remained the residence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> until 1376. The country about <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> constituted the County of Venaissin or the Margravate of Provence, which on the ground of a former donation of the Counts of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> in 1273, had been given up to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by the French king, Philip III the Bold. The city of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> itself first came into the possession of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> by purchase in 1348. During the residence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> in <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> dominion in the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> almost ceased. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the Colonna and Orsini fought for the supremacy. In the other cities the French regents, who were sent from <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, found anything but willing obedience. Bologna revolted in 1334 against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> relative, Beltram. Cola di Rienzi deluded the Romans with the phantom of a republic. The state of <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a> was first ended by the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> Cardinal Albornoz (see <a href="../cathen/06558a.htm">GIL DE ALBORNOZ, ALVAREZ CARILLO</a>), whom <a href="../cathen/08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a> sent to the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> in 1353. Albornoz not only brought the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> under subjection to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but also reorganized them by means of the &AElig;gidian Constitutions, which were in force in the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> until 1816. But the successes of Albornoz were soon nullified again, when the Great Schism occurred during the residence at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. After its termination <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> (1417-31) sought to establish a centralized monarchy out of the various conflicting <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, privileges, and usurpations and in this had much success. New afflictions were brought by the period of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> in which visionaries of radical views <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> to pose as liberators from tyranny. Thus the conspiracy of Stefano Porcaro alarmed <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> in 1453, and the conspiracy of 1468 alarmed <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a>. Other dangers lay in the growth of power of certain <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> nobility in the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in the nepotism of some of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, who provided for their relatives at the expense of the States of the church, or in their international policies, for which the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had to suffer.
<h3 id="D">From the sixteenth century to the Treaty of Vienna</h3>

<p>Under <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> disintegrated into a series of states held by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> relatives of the Borgia <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, Cesare Borgia, whom <a href="../cathen/09501a.htm">Machiavelli</a> admired, laboured earnestly from his Duchy of Romagna to transform the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> into a Kingdom of Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. After his fall (1504) <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> sought to bring the cities on the Adriatic Sea under its power. <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> then in his impetuous way had recourse to force to reestablish and extend the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He conquered <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> and Bologna and by the League of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> forced <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> to give up <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, <a href="../cathen/03545b.htm">Cervia</a>, <a href="../cathen/05751b.htm">Faenza</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a>. But, after he had been satisfied by the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a>, he concluded the Holy League for the expulsion of the French from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the French in 1512 were once more victorious over the troops of the League at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, but thanks chiefly to the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> mercenaries, whom the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had enlisted through Cardinal Schinner, Julius attained his object. On the surrender of the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> to Maximilian Sforza, <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> made a still further gain for the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, since <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> and <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a> were taken from the duchy and incorporated in the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Reggio and <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>, which belonged to the Duke of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, were also taken possession of by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but his successor <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> had to restore these cities to the duke in 1515. A dreadful catastrophe was brought upon <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the vacillating policy of <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>. The disorderly troops of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> overran and plundered the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, occupied <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 6 May, 1527, and for eight days rioted there frightfully (<em>Sacco di Roma</em>). In the Castle of S. Angelo the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was held captive until 6 December. It was long before these wounds were healed although the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1529 concluded a peace with the emperor at Barcelona and received back the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The conclusion of peace was confirmed by the Conference of Bologna, at which <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> on 24 April, 1530, received the imperial crown from <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>.

<p>During this time as well as later a number of districts were for a time separated from the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and conferred as separate principalities by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> on their relatives. The Rovere <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> had in 1474 made Federigo of <a href="../cathen/10528a.htm">Montefeltro</a> Duke of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, and married Federigo's daughter Giovanna to his nephew Giovanni della Rovere. The son of this Giovanni, Francesco Maria della Rovere, came into possession of the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a> in 1508, during the pontificate of the other Rovere <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>. In addition to this <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> in 1512 conferred on him the Vicariate of <a href="../cathen/11738b.htm">Pesaro</a>, which had previously been a fief in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/09566a.htm">Malatesta</a> and since 1445 of the Sforza. Not until the male line of the Rovere became extinct in 1631 were Montefeltro and <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a> together with <a href="../cathen/11738b.htm">Pesaro</a> restored to the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Pope Paul III</a> in 1545 bestowed <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> and <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a> as a duchy on his son Pier Luigi Farnese. Even after the Farnese line had become extinct, the duchies reverted, not to the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but to a branch of the Spanish Bourbons, and finally in 1860 to <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>. To make up for this <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, which had once belonged to <a href="../cathen/10049b.htm">Matilda of Canossa</a> as a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> fief, had in 1208 fallen to the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Este, and had in 1471 been made a duchy. After the main line of the Este had become extinct in 1597, <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> reverted to the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and remained part thereof (except during the Napoleonic period) until the Italian annexation in 1860. <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a> and Reggio, however, fell in 1597 to a collateral line of the Este as a fief of the empire. Thus the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> before the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> embraced substantially the territory that had belonged to them at the time of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, except that some portions of the old Duchy of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> had been added in the south since the time of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>.

<p>Rapid changes came with the time of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> and of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>. In 1791 the French National Assembly announced the union of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> and Venaissin with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and in the Peace of Tolentino (1797) <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> had to give them up, while at the same time relinquishing the legations of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, Bologna, and Romagna to the Cisalpine Republic. In February, 1798, General Berthier, who had been sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, formed the rest of the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> into the Roman Republic. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, because he would not renounce his claim, was taken away as a captive and eventually confined in <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a>, where death soon released him (29 August, 1799). People were already rejoicing that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the church had come to an end. Their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> was, however, premature. Under the protection of Emperor Francis II the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> in 1800 elected <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. But hard trials awaited him. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that in 1801 <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> favour got back the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as bounded in the Peace of Tolentino. But the position of the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> remained extremely precarious. <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> in 1806 conferred <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> on Talleyrand and Pontecorvo on Bernadotte. In 1808, because <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> would not close his ports to the English, the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were again occupied and in 1809 completely confiscated. The Marches, <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, <a href="../cathen/03216c.htm">Camerino</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09492a.htm">Macerata</a> were annexed to the newly-created <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>, the rest of the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Not until the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, where the able <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a> represented the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, were the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> again established (1815), almost in their old dimensions except that <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> and Venaissin were not restored to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> received a narrow strip along the frontier of the <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> district north of the Po and the right of garrisoning <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> and Comachio.
<h3 id="E">From the Peace of Vienna to 1870</h3>

<p>The liberal and national <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> prevalent throughout Central <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> undermined the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, just as they did the rest of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and found expression in the high-sounding phrases "constitution" and "national unification". The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> and <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> had awakened these <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. The name of a <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>, whose crown <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> had worn, was not forgotten. With the old conditions, which the congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> had restored, the people were by no means satisfied. They lamented the division of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> into various states, bound together by no common bond, and above all the fact that they were ruled by foreigners. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the King of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> alone were looked upon as really native rulers. The other rulers were regarded more or less as foreigners. Naples-Sicily was ruled by the Bourbon line, which had come there in 1738, and which was opposed particularly by <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. In <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> and <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a> also the Bourbon line, first established here in 1748, ruled again, from the death (1847) of Marie-Louise, wife of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a>. In <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a> and <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> collateral lines of the house of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> ruled: in the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>, a line which had in 1803 become the heir of the ancient ducal house of Este; in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, which, after the <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici</a> had become extinct, had fallen to the ducal house of <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, the line sprung from Ferdinand III, brother of Emperor Francis I of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Furthermore, the Austrians were the immediate rulers of the Lombard-Venetian Kingdom. The current of national feeling was directed above all against the rule of the Austrians at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> as a government by foreigners, and also against the governments which pursued the policies of and were protected by <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria's</a> statesman <a href="../cathen/10245a.htm">Metternich</a> had at heart the maintenance of the order established by the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1815. As the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were included among the governments under <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria's</a> protection, they gradually shared the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>.

<p>The narrow police spirit of the absolute governments, which did not distinguish between what was justifiable and what was not, promoted the growth of dissatisfaction, which first took shape in <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret societies</a>. <a href="../cathen/03330c.htm">Carbonarism</a> and <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">freemasonry</a> spread rapidly. The Greek <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of independence, which excited universal admiration, aroused the national spirit in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The Sanfedists (<em>per la santa fede</em>), as the loyal <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were called, were only a weak support for the Papal Government in the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03330c.htm">Carbonari</a>, led by exiles and made fugitives in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and yielding to the impression made by the Revolution of July, profited by the vacancy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chair after the death of <a href="../cathen/12134a.htm">Pius VIII</a> in 1830, to inaugurate rising in the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, especially in Bologna. Under the presidency of Mazzini, the founder of the revolutionary <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of the "Giovane Italia", delegates assembled at Bologna in 1831, as a parliament of the united provinces, to establish a republican form of government, and elected a provisional government. When the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> asked for <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria's</a> assistance, <a href="../cathen/10245a.htm">Metternich</a> was ready to intervene without delay. The Austrians restored peace in the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as also in <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a> and <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>. But hardly had the troops departed, when new disorders broke out, and, in answer to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> renewed call for help, the Austrians reappeared at Bologna in 1832 under Radetsky. To neutralize the influence of the Austrians the French Government of Louis Philippe sent to <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a> troops, which remained there as long as the Austrians occupied Bologna (until 1838). In opposition to the followers of Mazzini there were not lacking for a while men who strove to bring about the unification of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> with the co-operation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Their spokesman was at first the former <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of King Charles Albert of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, <a href="../cathen/06562b.htm">Vincenzo Gioberti</a>, who in 1843, as an exile in <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, wrote the treatise "Il primato morale e civile degli Italiani", a publication which caused a great sensation. He desired that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should become the head of the national union of states in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, from which the foreign princes were to be excluded. <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, however, was to act as regularly appointed protector of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Count Antonio <a href="../cathen/13194b.htm">Rosmini</a>, desired an Italian confederation with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at its head and two deliberative chambers. He published his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> in 1848 in the treatise "Delle cinque piaghe della S. Chiesa", in which he also particularly recommended the reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The son-in-law of <a href="../cathen/09634a.htm">Manzoni</a>, Marchese Massimo d'Azeglo, set forth the perverse political conditions in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and especially in the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> more unsparingly in the treatise "Gli ultimi casi di Romagna" (1846), in which he urgently advocated reform, but at the same time warned against conspiracy and revolution. The majority of those who were enthusiastic about the unification of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> put their hope in <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, "la spada d'Italia". Cesare Balbo in his book "Le speranze d'Italia", which appeared in 1844, expected first of all the founding of a union of the Lombard states.

<p>The demand for reform in the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was in fact not unjustified. It was expected that it would be inaugurated by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI's</a> successor, who was hailed with extravagant hopes, when as <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> he ascended the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chair on 16 June, 1846. Men saw in him the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of whom <a href="../cathen/06562b.htm">Gioberti</a> had dreamed. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> convoked at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a council of state composed of representatives of the various provinces, established a formal cabinet council, and sanctioned the formation of a militia in the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In addition he suggested to <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> and <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> the formation of an Italian customs union. But the country was wrought up too highly to continue peacefully and slowly along such a course. The <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were dissatisfied because the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> were excluded from participation in the government of the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Even before the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> of February they forced by a popular uprising the appointment in 1848 of a cabinet of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. On 14 March, 1848, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> after long hesitation decided to proclaim the fundamental law for the temporal government of the lands of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; as in other lands two chambers were to vote upon the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which were to be drawn up by a council of state. But the chambers were forbidden to interfere in any way in questions purely spiritual or of a mixed character, and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a> had the right of veto over the decision of the chambers. This <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> unsatisfactory. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> was also expected to accommodate himself to the national desires when <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> after the outbreak of the revolution in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> had risen against the Austrians and <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a> was preparing to support the uprising. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> too, it was thought, should draw the sword against <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>.

<p>When <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in an <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> announced on 29 April, 1848, that he could never persuade himself to engage in a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> power such as <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and that he would never assume the headship of an Italian confederation, his popularity in Liberal-National circles was wellnigh at an end. The party of those, who with <a href="../cathen/06562b.htm">Gioberti</a> had dreamed of a unification of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> under the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, crumbled away. Mazzini made the demand that <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> be erected into a republic. A portion of the civic guard surrounded the Castle of S. Angelo and compelled the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to appoint Liberal <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>. But the revolutionary republicans would have nothing to do with such a compromise. They became bolder than ever when King Charles Albert was defeated by Radetsky at Custozza on 24-25 July, 1848, and the monarchical national party had thereby met with complete failure. When the Liberal minister Rossi sought to reorganize the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and at the same time urged on the formation of a confederation of the Italian states, he was stabbed to death on the steps of the Palace of the Cancelleria on 15 November, 1848. On the following day the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> found himself besieged in the Quirinal Only with difficulty could the <a href="../cathen/15276b.htm#swissguard">Swiss Guards</a> protect him from the fury of the populace. On 24 November <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> escaped in disguise to <a href="../cathen/06333a.htm">Gaeta</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan Kingdom</a>, whither King Ferdinand II had returned to take command in person. After the flight of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> an assembly was elected to administer the government, the republic was proclaimed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 9 February, 1849, and the temporal sovereignty declared abolished. Mazzini with his international following ruled at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In Florence also the republic was proclaimed on 18 February. But reaction followed quickly. This was hastened when the Austrians in a new passage of arms had defeated the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> at Mortara on 21 March, 1849, and at <a href="../cathen/11134b.htm">Novara</a> on 23 March. Charles Albert thereupon resigned in favour of his son Victor Emmanuel II. The Austrians were now more powerful in Upper <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> than ever. They brought back to Florence the Grand Duke of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. Ferdinand II suppressed the revolution in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> was readily heard when he appealed to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> powers for assistance against the republic. To anticipate <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Louis Napoleon</a>, then president of the Second Republic, with the consent of the Constituent Assembly in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, sent a force under Oudinot into the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, where besides Mazzini many revolutionaries from other lands (including Garibaldi) had gathered, and a triumvirate, composed of Mazzini, Aurelio Saffi, and Carlo Armellini, was administering the government. Oudinot's small force soon after its landing at <a href="../cathen/03798b.htm">Civitavecchia</a> was, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, at first defeated before <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. But now the Austrians also entered the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the north, in the south the Neapolitans, while in <a href="../cathen/14518c.htm">Terracina</a> <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> landed. Oudinot received reinforcements and began the siege of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Garibaldi with 5000 volunteers cut his way through to continue the struggle in the Apennines. On 2 July, 1849, Oudinot entered <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and again restored the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> re-entered <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 12 April, 1850.

<p>Thus not only the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> and their followers, but the Republicans also had been routed, and had shown that they were unable to bring about the unity of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. By the military power of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> all of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy's</a> forces had been shattered. But the object was not abandoned. A different programme was now adopted: to proceed with foreign aid under <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont's</a> leadership against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a> sought to retain the sympathies of all <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> by keeping the constitution, while the remaining governments of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> had returned to absolutism. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, bitterly disillusioned, declared the retention of a constitution wholly incompatible with the most vital interests and the canons of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as well as with the independence and freedom of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Between him, the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> no efforts could bring about an understanding that was satisfactory to all. A French garrison maintained the sovereignty of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, while the Austrians secured tranquillity in the legations. The question was: how long would the two foreign powers continue harmoniously side by side in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>? It was answered when <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a> undertook to show <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> the splendour of his imperial power and to force <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> out of its position of military supremacy in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The change of temper in those circles of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> that were striving for national unification was shown in a new treatise of <a href="../cathen/06562b.htm">Gioberti</a>, who in 1843 in his "Primato" had assigned the guidance to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In 1851 he published his book "Rinnovamento civile d'Italia" in which he set forth that the unification could be accomplished without <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and even against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the aid of <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>. To prepare <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a> for this r&ocirc;le was the task of Camillo Cavour, who was made prime minister in 1852. It was also he who found for <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> the ally who united with it against <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. At Plombi&egrave;res, a watering-place in <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, he interested <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon</a> in his plans in July, 1859, and all measures down to the smallest details were here agreed upon. The <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> succeeded in joining their forces with the French army, and the allies defeated the Austrians at Magenta and Solferino. <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon</a>, however, then swiftly concluded with the Emperor Francis Joseph the Peace of Villafranca-Z&uuml;rich, by the terms of which <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> had to give up <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> only, not Venetia; in it provision was also made for an Italian confederation, into which all Italian states, including <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> for Venetia, were to enter, and over which it was intended that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should preside. <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon</a> feared the intervention of the other powers, and at the same time was eager to show consideration for the feelings of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.

<p>In national circles in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> men were at first furious at the conditions of this treaty of peace. But calm soon returned when it was seen that <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon</a> made no preparations to bring back the expelled petty princes, and that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> would have nothing to do with the r&ocirc;le assigned to him. Cavour was able to continue his efforts in behalf of his schemes by the secret path of conspiracy. At his instigation apparently independent governments were established at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>, and Bologna; in reality, however, these were directed from <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, and were supported by <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, since <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> did not desire a <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a> dependent on <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, in the district of Modena-Parma, which had formed itself into the Republic of Emilia, and in the legations a vote of the inhabitants was taken, 15-20 March, 1860, which resulted unanimously in favour of annexation to <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>. <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon</a> himself had half desired this deceptive expedient, by means of which he had himself once risen to power, in order that he might have an excuse for letting matters take their own course. By the same expedient he now had voted to him the indemnity, stipulated in advance, for his interference in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> and Nice, which by a popular vote declared themselves for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> did not suffer the annexation of the legations quietly. He <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Victor Emmanuel and those who had assisted him. At the same time he issued a call for the formation of a volunteer army, which was joined by many of the French legitimists. The command of the army was undertaken by a bitter enemy of <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon</a>, General Lamorici&egrave;re, who had distinguished himself in Algeria. In a very short time the volunteer army saw active service. Garibaldi with 1000 armed insurgents had come from <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> and landed at Marsala in May, 1860, had revolutionized <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and was marching against <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. The Government at <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, which had at first allowed Garibaldi to do as he pleased, now saw with displeasure the progress of the Republicans, and feared that these might anticipate it at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. It sent an army to the south. <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon</a>, whose consent Cavour had sought for the foreseen clash with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, sent word to <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> "Fate presto" (act quickly) and crossed to Algeria that he might not see what was going on. At Castelfidardo, not far from <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> army met the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> forces under Lamorici&egrave;re, and Lamorici&egrave;re was defeated on 18 September, 1860. The <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> occupied the Marches, and then advanced into the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>. By a vote of the inhabitants on 21 September the population was then allowed to declare itself in favour of annexation to <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>. King Francis II of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> after a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> defence was forced to capitulate at <a href="../cathen/06333a.htm">Gaeta</a> on 13 February, 1861, and retired to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. All the annexed provinces sent representatives to the <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> Parliament, and Victor Emmanuel II was here proclaimed King of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> on 13 March, 1861. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Venetia alone were still to be won. Venetia was added to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in 1866 as the result of the victories of its ally, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>.

<p>At last <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was also to follow. <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon</a> had at the end of December, 1866, withdrawn the small French garrison from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> indeed that a foreign legion, composed for the most part of French soldiers and officers, was formed at Antibes to undertake the protection of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but its position was nevertheless very critical. Garibaldi in the autumn of 1867 invaded the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with his insurgents. Then <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon</a> once more sent a force from Toulon, which together with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> army repulsed the forces of Garibaldi near Mentana, northeast of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 3 November, 1867. The French garrison after this remained in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Parisian</a> Government had to yield to the wishes of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Not until 20 July, 1870, after the Franco-German War had broken out, were the troops withdrawn. After <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon</a> had been taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> at Sedan, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, which had removed its capital to Florence in 1865, sent troops against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under Cadorna, and these on 20 September, 1870, entered the city through the breach at the Porta Pia. A vote, which declared in favour of annexation to <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, was here also to give approval to the occupation. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> all participants in and authors of the occupation of the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. All <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> condemned the action of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. To protect itself against the remonstrances, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> on 13 May, 1871, issued the so-called law of the Papal Guarantees (see <a href="../cathen/07048a.htm">LAW OF GUARANTEES</a>), which was to secure to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> his sovereignty, the inviolability of his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as well as the freedom of the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> and of the &oelig;cumenical councils. In addition to this a yearly pension of 3,225,000 francs was voted to him. The Vatican, the Lateran, and the country-seat Castel Gandolfo were declared extra-territorial. But <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> to maintain his protests against the seizure of the States of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> refused to accept the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and shut himself up in the Vatican.

<p>The Roman question remains unsettled to the present day, since its solution by <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> has thus far been absolutely one-sided, besides having been brought about by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. Without heeding the protests of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was declared the capital of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> on 30 June, 1871. The radical elements, who were hostile to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and who had contributed so much to the unification of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, continued for the future also to hold the upper hand. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Non expedit" of 29 February, 1868, had forbidden the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to participate in the political life and especially in the election of representatives of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>. Only in very recent years has a gradual tendency to a change of relations become noticeable. Although <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, because of the principle involved, adheres to the "Non expedit", he permits the participation of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in administrative elections (municipal and provincial elections), and since the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Certum Consilium" of 11 June, 1905, in certain cases on the recommendation of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> also participation in the parliamentary elections. Since that time the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have begun to take part in the political life of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (1909: 22 representatives) and to exert an influence which we hope will redound to the welfare of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>.
