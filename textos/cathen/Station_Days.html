<h1>Station Days</h1>  

<p>Days on which in the early Church fast was observed until the Hour of None (between twelve and three o'clock), later of Sext (nine to twelve), as distinct from the strict observance of the fast day proper until <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> (three to six). The ancient <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> writers commonly apply the word <em>statio</em> to fast days, but a distinction must be made between <em>jejunium</em> and <em>statio</em>. Pamelius will not admit this distinction, but <a href="../cathen/02645b.htm">Cardinal Bona</a> is less uncompromising and admits that though <em>statio</em> is sometimes identical with <em>jejunium</em> this is not an absolute rule. The <em>statio</em> came to an end at the Hour of None, but the <em>jejunium</em> was not broken till the Hour of <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, which is a notable difference. However, <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> speaks of a less rigorous fast which was broken sooner and which he calls <em>semi-jejunium</em>. In this case the faithful did as on a day of <em>statio</em>, and the fast did not differ from the one on that day. To <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> <em>solvere stationem</em> meant exactly the same as <em>solvere jejunium</em>. But <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> designated certain churches in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as <em>stationes</em> and recommended that on the more solemn festivals they should be made stations (<em>stationes fieri</em>) until the Hour of Sext, and at these same churches on the appointed days (<em>statis dicbus</em>) the faithful should assist at the Office. The stations have long since been abandoned and have left their trace only in the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, but in some instances the fast lasted longer and has been preserved even to modern times. The classic text on the <em>stationes</em> is found in <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian's</a> "De Oratione" (XLV): "Similiter et stationum diebus non putant plerique sacrificiorum orationibus interveniendum quod statio solvenda sit accepto corpore Domini". (In the same way many think that on Station days we must not be present at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> because the Station should be finished when the Lord's Body is received.) Comparison of other phrases of the same author with this passage shows that the <em>statio</em> was celebrated on Wednesday and Friday, of each week, lasting until the ninth hour. The 69th Apostolic Canon enjoins the observance of a fast on these two days.

<p>An explanation of the fast of the <em>stationes</em> has been found in the fact that the solemnity was fixed <em>statis diebus</em>, but this is a purely verbal coincidence; and it seems difficult to find in it anything else. <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> gives a reason which may have been accepted in his time: "Our fasts", he says (Sermo XXV), "are our encampments against the attacks of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; they are called <em>stationes</em> because we remain standing" (<em>stantes</em>). It also seems probable that these days of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> were characterized by endless watchings, and processions either within or around the church, when the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to remain standing, <em>stantes</em>, as is said in modern French in exactly the same sense, <em>stationner</em>, to stand. <em>Statio</em> became the place before which or within which the faithful walked in procession and, tired out, but always standing, sometimes leaning on a stick, assisted, before separating, at the celebration of the Liturgy. The churches to which they repaired took the name of <em>stationes</em>, though incorrectly, and the route followed to reach them became <em>statio ad</em>. . . . The <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> became the object of a kind of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to which the faithful went in a body, and thus arose another <em>statio ad</em>. . . But the <em>martyria</em> alone did not attract the crowds; it became the custom to go to the celebrated <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a>, and sometimes all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of a large city assembled at a certain point, probably in the vicinity of the episcopal residence, to go thence with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the patriarch, or the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself to the place assigned for the celebration of the Eucharist. As time went on <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> or <em>tituli</em> were formed in the cities and their grouping gave rise to vexatious questions of precedence, which were solved as well as could be by "rotation". <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> has preserved the most complete accounts of its stational churches, but we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that these celebrations also took place at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and Constantinople. The going to the <em>statio</em> was quite a <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>; thither were carried the <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a>, <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> instruments, all that was peculiar to the service of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and also, doubtless, all that would supplement the insufficient <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> furniture of the church to which they were going. The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber pontificalis"</a> states that <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Leo III</a> (795) had twenty silver vessels made which were borne by <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a> in the processions to the stations. There is extant a writing called "De locis sanctis martyrum qu&aelig; sunt foris civitatis Rom&aelig;", the last chapter of which contains the list of "station <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a>" of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This little document, the work of a German pilgrim, dates from the pontificate of Honorius I (625-38), but seems to be based on an older compilation dating at least from <a href="../cathen/11603a.htm">Pelagius II</a> (579-90).

<p>The following is the list of the station churches as it was compiled in the time of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>: Patriarchal <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a>, S. Giovanni in Laterano, S. Pietro, S. Maria Maggiore, S. Paolo Fuori le Mura, S. Lorenzo Fuori le Mura; <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalitial</a> titles, S. Sisto; SS. Giovanni e Paolo, SS. Quattro Coronati, S. Clemente, S. Marcellino e Pietro, S. Pietro in Vincoli, S. Silvestro ai Monti, S. Prassede, S. Pudenziana, S. Eusebio, S. Vitale, S. Susanna, S. Ciriacos, S. Marcello, S. Lorenzo in Lucina, S. Lorenzo in Damaso, S. Marco, S. Anastasia, S. Nereo e Achilleo, S. Balbina, S. Sabina, S. Prisca, S. Maria in Trastevere, S. Cecilia, S. Crisogono; diaconates (those which had been stations before they were diaconates), S. Nicolo in Carcere, SS. Cosma e Damiano, S. Maria in Via Lata, S. Maria in Porticu, S. Maria in Domnica. The number of stations is eighty-six, and, that of the churches being less, some of them have the station several times in the year. S. Sabina, the station established by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> for <a href="../cathen/01775b.htm">Ash Wednesday</a>, is the most important of all because it was long customary for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> to repair thither on that day to distribute the ashes to the people.

<p>Persons desirous of gaining the station <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> first repair to a church in the vicinity of the station in imitation of the ancient collect, or gathering of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the people, preparatory to the procession. In this church <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are recited from the Station Manual, consisting of invocations to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> and the Martyrs. Then begins the journey to the station accompanied by the recitation of the Miserere, 5 Paters, the Ave and Gloria, and the steps of the Passion of Christ. On arrival at the station church the <a href="../cathen/09291a.htm">Litany of the Saints</a> is said with versicles and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, ending with the "De Profundis". The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> grants <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> to all who are unable to go in person to the stations, such as <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloistered</a> religious, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>, the sick, etc., who are free to visit their own church and say the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> prescribed. <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinals</a> and their attendants and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court may gain the station <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> by reciting certain <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in their oratory. These <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are printed annually and distributed to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who assist at the first Sistine chapel of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>.
