<h1>Stefano Borgia</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Velletri</a>, 3 December, 1731; died at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, 1804; Italian <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, antiquarian, and historian. He belonged to a well known <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Velletri</a>, not to be confounded with the Spanish Borgias or Borjas. [<em>Ed. Note:</em> The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> was, in fact, distantly related to the Spanish Borjas, who had <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> from Jativa, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, in the twelfth or thirteenth century.] His early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was controlled by his uncle Allessandro (1682-1764), <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06043c.htm">Fermo</a>. From his youth, Stefano Borgia manifested a great aptitude for historical research, but his dominant trait was his extraordinary taste for relics of ancient civilizations, a line in which he succeeded so well that, at the age of nineteen, he was received into the Academy of Cortona. He founded a museum in <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Velletri</a>, in which, during his whole life, he gathered <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, especially Coptic, and which may be considered as his greatest undertaking and achievement. Such was his passion for antiquities that he is known to have sold his jewels and precious earthenware in order to secure the coveted treasures and have the description of them printed. In his scientific career Borgia showed great disinterestedness, placing his collection at the disposal of learned men, regardless of creed and country, and giving them all possible encouragement and support. His amiable temperament and broad-minded character attracted to him all those with whom he came in contact; Paolinoda S. Bartolomeo, Adler, <a href="../cathen/15763a.htm">Zoega</a>, Heeren, and many others were among his enthusiastic friends.

<p>Borgia was not left, however, entirely to his chosen field of activity, but was called to fill several important political positions. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> appointed him Governor of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, and Borgia showed there great administrative talent. In 1770 he was made secretary of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation de Propaganda Fide</a>, an office of which he naturally took advantage to acquire antiquities by the help of the missionaries &#151; a help, be it said to their credit, which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> always forthcoming. He was made a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1789. In the troubled period of the French invasion Borgia was given charge of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> (1797-98). After the proclamation of the Republic, he was arrested (1798), but quickly released, whereupon he immediately resumed his studies and work of collecting; soon afterwards he joined <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> at Vallencia, and endeavoured to have this pontiff send to <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and Africa a body of missionaries who would preach the Gospel and gather various monuments.

<p>Cardinal Borgia was of the greatest service to <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pope Pius VII</a> in the reorganization of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>. In 1801 he was made Rector of the Collegium Romanum, and he was in the retinue of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> when this pontiff went to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to crown the new emperor <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>. Having arrived at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, Cardinal Borgia was taken ill and died. After his death his collection of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> was divided: the non-Biblical <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> were taken to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and placed in the Biblioteca Barbonica, now the Biblioteca Nazional; and the Biblical <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, excepting a few which were taken to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> by mistake, given to the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, together with the collection of <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> and monuments forming the Museo Borgiano (Cf. Ciasca, Fragmenta Copto-Sahidica, I, p. xvii.) Only a few years ago the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the Museo Borgiano were transferred to the Vatican Library, where they are to be found today. Before the partition of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> was made the eminent scholar and convert, <a href="../cathen/15763a.htm">Zoega</a>, wrote a complete and accurate description of them in his posthumous work "Catologus Codicum Copticorum manu scriptorum qui in Museo Borgiano Velitris ad servantur" (Rome, 1810). Besides the many services which Cardinal Borgia rendered to <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and scientists, he published several works bearing especially on historical topics: "Monumento di papa Giovanni XVI" (Rome, 1750); "Breve istoria dell antica citt&agrave; di Benevento" (ibid., 1763-69);"Vaticana confessio B. Petri chronoligcis testimoniis illustrata" (ibid., 1776); "De Cruce Vatican&acirc;" (ibid., 1779); "De Cruce Velitern&acirc;" (ibid., 1780; "Istoria del dominio temporale della Sede Apostolica nelle Due-Sicilie" (ibid., 1788).

<p>[<em>Note:</em> Cardinal Borgia's body was transferred from the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> to his hometown of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Velletri</a> on February 13, 2002, and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in that <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> on March 8, 2002.]
