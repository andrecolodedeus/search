<h1>Stephan Ladislaus Endlicher</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> botanist (botanical abbreviation, <em>Endl.</em>), linguist, and historian, b. at Pressburg, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, 24 June, 1804; d. at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 28 March, 1849. The son of a physician, he studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at Pesth and <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> from 1823 to 1826 at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>; he did not, however, enter the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. From 1826 at Pressburg he turned his attention to languages, studying especially Chinese, a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of which is shown in some of his later works: "Anfangsgr&uuml;nde der chinesischen Grammatik" (Vienna, 1844), and "Atlas von China nach der Aufnahme der Jesuiten" (Vienna, 1843). Urged by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, Endlicher took up the study of botany in 1826, and devoted all his spare time to it during the years 1828-36, when he had charge of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in the Imperial Library of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. In this same period he issued as librarian, in addition to a number of works on the ancient classical, German, and Hungarian literatures, the first volume (Vienna, 1836) of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> catalogue of the Imperial Library. In 1836, he was made curator of the botanical department of the Royal Natural History Museum, and in 1840, professor of botany at the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a>, and director of the Botanical Garden of the University. In 1830, he had issued his first botanical treatise, that on the flora of Pressburg. As curator of the botanical department he united the various distinct herbaria into one scientifically arranged general herbarium, to which he added, as a gift, his own containing 30,000 species of plants; the classification adopted by Endlicher remained unchanged until 1885. On his appointment as curator he began at once to develop his botanical system, which is explained in his well-known and most important work: "Genera plantarum secundum ordines naturales disposita" (Vienna, 1836-50), a work regarded as one of the fundamental writings of systematized botany.

<p>As early as 1835 he founded the first periodical in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> for the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, the "Annalen des Wiener Museums der Naturgeschichte". His numerous other writings on botanical subjects show an independent critical judgment, acute observation, and comprehensive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Endlicher also collaborated in a number of publications with other botanists; with Schott, Fenzl, and especially with Unger in "Grundz&uuml;ge der Botanik" (Vienna, 1843); with P&ouml;ppig in a work on the plants of <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>, <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, and the region of the Amazon (Leipzig, 1835-45); also in conjunction with the American Asa Gray, and with George Bentham and Robert Brown of Great Britain. Up to the time of his death Endlicher aided von Martius in editing the latter's great work "Flora Brasiliensis" (Munich and Leipzig, 1840-1906); the work, a folio costing 6000 marks, was finally completed in 130 parts of 20,733 pages in all, and containing 3811 plates. It was through Endlicher's exertions that von Martius was enabled to begin the bringing out of this work under the patronage, and with the financial aid, of the Emperor Ferdinand I. Endlicher's botanical <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and correspondence belong to the botanical department of the Royal Museum at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>; his correspondence with Unger was published by the botanist Haberlandt (Berlin, 1899). In addition to his other labours, he had a large share in founding (1846-47) the Imperial Academy of Sciences of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and was one of its first forty members. Endlicher became involved in the political movement of 1848; he was elected a member both of the German and the Austrian parliaments, but his political activities were not successful. Botanists have, on three occasions, sought to use his name as a designation of species of plants (<em>Endlichera, Endlicheria</em>), but according to the rules of the botanical nomenclature, such appellations express synonyms which should be avoided.
