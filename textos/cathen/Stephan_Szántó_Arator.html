<h1>Stephan Sz&aacute;nt&oacute; (Arator)</h1>  

<p>Born in the Diocese of Raab, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, 1541; died at <a href="../cathen/11247a.htm">Olm&uuml;tz</a> in 1612. On finishing his studies in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, he attached himself to the Diocese of Raab, and in 1560 was sent by his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to the German College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Here he joined the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit order</a>, and after his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. In 1566 he returned to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and thence went as professor to Nagy-Szomb&agrave;t. The succeeding years were spent at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and <a href="../cathen/06733d.htm">Graz</a>, where he lectured on <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. In 1568 Sz&agrave;nt&oacute; strove to found a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mission for <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>, where <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> was making great headway; this project he continued in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, wither he was summoned in 1579 as Hungarian penitentiary. This last position he held until 1579. His endeavours to found a <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungarian</a> College in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> after the model of the German College met with but temporary success. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Hermits of St. Paul near St. Stephen's on the Coelian was to serve for this purpose; the deed of foundation was approved by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was opened on 28 May, 1579. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, however, soon united the college with the German College. At the end of 1579 Sz&agrave;nt&oacute; left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and proceeded to <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>, where he displayed great activity in the work of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missions at Klausenberg (Kolozav&agrave;r), and later at V&agrave;rad. At this time occurred his literary polemics with the Reform preacher Peter Beregsz&agrave;szi, against which he wrote his "Epistola apologetica". In 1585, Sz&agrave;nt&oacute; proceeded to Gyula-Feh&eacute;rv&agrave;r, and thence, on the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit order</a> from <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>, to S&eacute;llye. In 1600 he went to Zni&oacute;v&agrave;ralja, and in 1605, on the destruction of this place by the troops of Bocskay, to <a href="../cathen/11247a.htm">Olm&uuml;tz</a>, where he remained until his death. During the siege of Zni&oacute;v&agrave;ralja his books and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, including the Hungarian <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> which he composed in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, were lost; until his death, he was working on a translation of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, which was later used by Georg K&agrave;ldy. Sz&agrave;nt&oacute; must also be credited, as has been recently <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, with the Hungarian portion of the great dictionary of <a href="../cathen/03169a.htm">Calepino</a>.
