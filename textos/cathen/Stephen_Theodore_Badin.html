<h1>Stephen Theodore Badin</h1>  

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> within the limits of the original thirteen States of the Union, pioneer missionary of Kentucky, b. at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 17 July, 1768; d. at <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, 21 April, 1853. <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">Educated</a> at Montaigu College, Paris, he entered the Sulpician Seminary of his native city in 1789. He was <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> when the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was closed by the revolutionary government, in 1791, and sailed from <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> for the American mission in November of the same year, with the Revs. B.J. Flaget and J.B. David, both destined in <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">God's providence</a> to wear the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> in <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>. They arrived in Philadelphia on the 26th of March, 1792, and were welcomed at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> by Bishop Carroll on the 28th. Stephen T. Badin pursued his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies with the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by Bishop Carroll, 25 May, 1793. His was the first <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. After a few months spent at <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown</a> to perfect himself in English, Father Badin was appointed to the Mission of Kentucky. He left for that scene of his apostolic labours with Father Barri&egrave;res, 3 September, 1793, travelled on foot as far as Pittsburgh, and by flat boat down the Ohio, landing at Limestone (Maysville), Ky., where they found twenty <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. They walked sixty-five miles to Lexington, and on the first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a>, 1793, Father Badin said his first Mass in Kentucky at the house of Denis McCarthy.

<p>He settled at White Sulphur, Scott County, sixteen miles from Lexington, and for about eighteen months attended this church and neighbouring missions. In April, 1794, his companion, who resided in Bardstown, left for <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, and Father Badin was now alone in the Kentucky mission. For fourteen years he attended to the spiritual wants of the various <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlements, scattered over an extent of more than 120 miles, forming new congregations, building churches, never missing an appointment. To visit his missions regularly he had to live in the saddle, and it is estimated that he rode more than 100,000 miles during his ministry in <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>. For many years he was unaided and alone; it was only in July, 1806, that he received permanent help, when the Rev. Charles Nerinckx came to take the larger part of the burden from his shoulders. They lived together at St. Stephen's, on Pottingers Creek, which was still their headquarters on the arrival, in 1811, of Bishop Flaget, whom Father Badin had suggested and urged as first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bardstown. Difficulties about the holding of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> soon arose between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and Father Badin, without, however, interfering with the reverence of the latter for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> friendship for him. Together they went to <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> in 1812 to submit the controversy to Archbishop Carroll. It was not settled. They returned to Kentucky in April, 1813, and Father Badin resumed his missionary <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and accompanied his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on many pastoral journeys, until 1819. The Rev. J. B. David had been appointed coadjutor in 1817, but persistently refused to accept the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. Father Badin, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that this selection would put an end to the controversy about <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, and be for the good of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of which he was the founder, left for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in the spring of 1819. The <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of Bishop David in September of that year, and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> suspicions about his disposition of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church properties</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to remain abroad. In 1820 he accepted the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Millaney and Marreilly-en-Gault, about forty miles from <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>. He continued, however, to take the greatest interest in the Kentucky missions, insisted on his loyalty to Bishop Flaget, and helped constantly and generously to secure gifts in money and valuable church-furniture for the missionaries. In 1822 he published in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, a "Statement of the Missions in Kentucky", with the same purpose in view.

<p>Father Badin returned to America in 1828. After a year on the Michigan mission, he went back to Kentucky in 1829. The next year he offered his services to Bishop Fenwick of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, and took charge of the Pottawottomie Indians at St. Joseph's River. Miss Campau of <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, an expert Indian linguist, acted as interpreter and teacher, until Father Badin left the place in 1836. Having returned to Cincinnati in that year, he wrote for the "Catholic Telegraph" a series of controversial "Letters to an Episcopalian Friend". In 1837 he went to Bardstown, Ky., was appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, and continued to visit the various missions. In 1841 he removed to <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> household. In that year he conveyed a great deal of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> (notably that of <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Portland</a>, near Louisville) to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and a farm to the <a href="../cathen/14150a.htm">Very Rev. E. Sorin</a> of Notre Dame, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>.

<p>On the 25th of May, 1843, Father Badin celebrated the golden jubilee of his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, at Lexington, where he had offered up the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a> for the first time in <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>. In September, 1846, he accepted from Bishop Quarter of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> the pastorship of the French settlement at Bourbonnais Grove, Kankakee County, Illinois. In the winter of 1848 he was again in <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, and Bishop-Coadjutor Spalding welcomed him to the episcopal household. About two years later he became the guest of <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">Archbishop Purcell</a> at <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, and eventually died at the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> residence. His body lay undisturbed in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> for over fifty years. In 1904 Archbishop Elder permitted its removal to the <a href="../cathen/11132a.htm">University of Notre Dame</a>, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>.

<p>Father Badin's writings are: "Etat des missions du Kentucky" (Paris, 1822), tr. in the "U.S. Cath. Miscellany" for December, 1824, and in the "Catholic World", September, 1875; "Carmen Sacrum", a Latin poem composed on the arrival of Bishop Flaget in <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, June, 1811, translated into English by Colonel Theodore O'Hara of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, Ky., author of the "Bivouac of the Dead"; "Epicedium", Latin poem composed on the occasion of the death of Col. Joe Davis at the Battle of Tippecanoe, 7 November, 1811, translated by Doctor Michell of New York (Louisville, 1844); "Sanctissim&aelig; Trinitatis Laudes et Invocatio" (Louisville, 1843), also the original text and tr. in Webb's "The Centenary of Catholicity in Kentucky" (Louisville, 1844); "Letters to an Episcopalian Friend"---three controversial articles on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the Eucharist (published in the "Catholic Telegraph" of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, 1836).
