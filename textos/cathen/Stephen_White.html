<h1>Stephen White</h1>  

<p>Antiquarian and polyhistor; b. at Clonmel, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, in 1574; d. in <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a>, 1646. He belonged to a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> devoted to religion and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. In 1592 Trinity College, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, was founded, and S. White (in all probability Stephen White) was one of the few students named in the charter. Unwilling to take the <a href="../cathen/11177a.htm">oath of supremacy</a>, he left his native land and entered the <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a> at Salamanca, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where in 1596 he joined the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, and taught from 1602 to 1606. The domestic record says of him "plurimum profecit in litteris". This skill he employed as one of the two principal collaborators of <a href="../cathen/02348a.htm">William Bathe's</a> systematic language method called "Janua linguarum", a work on which Comenius twenty years later based his celebrated "Janua linguarum reserata". In 1606 he went to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and lectured on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>, at <a href="../cathen/04795a.htm">Dillingen</a>, and other places. He applied himself assiduously to the study of history and was generally reputed to be one of the most leaned men of his time in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Ussher calls him "a man profoundly versed in the ancient records, not of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> alone, but of other countries". His chief interest was in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> history. To him is due the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of fixing the historic label "Scotia" where it belongs &#151; to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. He called attention to the rich treasures of <a href="../cathen/08116a.htm">Irish literature</a> preserved in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and generously supplied many noted scholars, as Ussher and <a href="../cathen/04099c.htm">Colgan</a>, with accurate copies of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> accompanied by critical emendations and valuable commentaries. His biographical notices of early <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were utilized in the "Acta SS." What gave him the bent towards early <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> history seems to have been the publication at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfurt</a> by Camden of two works by Gerald of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, <a href="../cathen/09210a.htm">libelling</a> <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and its people. In refutation he wrote his best-known work "Apologia pro Hibernia adversus Cambri calumnias". After an absence of nearly thirty-eight years he returned to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> to join the staff at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> recently established at <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. The college, however, was in a short time suppressed by the Government, and the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was confiscated and handed over to Trinity College. For some years he laboured in his native <a href="../cathen/15564b.htm">Diocese of Waterford and Lismore</a>, mainly engaged in teaching <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> to children. In 1644 he went to <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a> where he died.
