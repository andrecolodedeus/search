<h1>Stipend</h1>  

<p>[<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>stipendium</em>, a tax, import, tribute; in military use, pay, salary; contraction for <em>stipipendium</em>, from <em>stips</em>, a gift, donation, <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> (given in small <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coin</a>), and <em>pendere</em>, to weigh out]

<p>A stipend is a fixed pay, salary; retribution for work done; the income of an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> living. In canon law stipend is a general designation of means of support (<em>sustentatio congrua</em> or <em>congrua</em>) provided for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In the early ages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> no special provision was made for the maintenance of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, the tent-maker, set the example (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#vrs12">1 Corinthians 4:12</a>) of earning his own livelihood. In imitation of him many <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> worked at some craft or followed some profession, living by the labour of their own hands. Even in the fifth and sixth centuries there were <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, who in keeping with the advice of the Fourth <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> (a. 398, cann. 52, 53) supported themselves by their own labour. Early legislation (Canon. Apost., can. 6), which forbade the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to take up certain occupations and professions, is an indication that <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> sought to maintain themselves. Many of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, however, even from the beginning, were quick to follow the instructions of Christ and his Apostles (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs10">Matthew 10:10</a>; <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#vrs7">Luke 10:7</a>; <a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs13">1 Corinthians 9:13</a>; <a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#vrs17">1 Timothy 5:17-18</a>), founded on the practice in vogue among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (<a href="../bible/lev027.htm#vrs30">Leviticus 27:30 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/num018.htm#vrs23">Numbers 18:23 sq.</a>; etc.), who gave <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of all their goods and produce for the sustenance of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and levites. Thus did the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> provide for the bodily welfare of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in return for the spiritual gifts received through their ministry. Later the payment of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> was frequently insisted on by <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, St. Augustine, and others (<a href="../cathen/14697c.htm">Thomassin</a>, "Vet. et nov. eccl. disc., " III, II, xii, xiv). The Synods of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> (560) and M&acirc;con (586) strenuously exhorted the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to pay the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> made their payment <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> on his subjects by a royal ordinance of 779, the requirements of which he himself faithfully observed. The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of giving <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> has long since ceased almost universally, but the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, of course, must contribute to the proper support of sacred <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> offerings of the people made on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and other occasions were also intended in part for the maintenance of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, that they might not be compelled to engage in pursuits which might ill become the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a> or withdraw the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> from their spiritual work. In most countries the offerings of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> still constitute the chief support of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. A quasi-contract obtains between the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> on the one hand and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who minister to its wants on the other. Pastor and assistants are engaged in the work of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and receive in return a definite salary from the income or revenues of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. These revenues are derived from pew-rental, offerings, collections, subscriptions, and whatever other sources of income the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> may possess. Clerics engaged in teaching or other work not <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> are supported in much the same way, obtaining a salary from the institution by which they are employed. The salary (<em>congrua</em>) of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and assistants should be a fixed sum, such as will suffice for their necessities. The amount paid will depend on various circumstances of time, place, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, income of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the incumbent. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIV, c. 13, de ref.) directs <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to arrange. the <em>congrua</em> in the most convenient way. Salaries of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> are determined in <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> or otherwise with the advice of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> consultors (Cone. Plen. Balt. III, n. 273). Stole fees (jura stol&aelig;), or perquisites received on the occasion of the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> or <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a>, are not in the nature of stipends. At times, nevertheless, by <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> regulations, they form a portion of the salary of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> and assistants.

<p>In regard to so-called state aid of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the State began indirectly to help the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the time of Constantine, who gave a legal existence to churches as corporate bodies, permitting them to receive donations and legacies and to hold the same in perpetuity (Cod. Theod., XVI, 2, 4). He ordered contributions of grain to be given annually to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> out of the public granaries. He contributed large sums from his own resources for the support of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, and exempted the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from imposts in an edict imposing a general tax (Cod. Theod., XI, i, 1). Direct support of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> by the State is of comparatively modern origin, having developed since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. It obtains particularly in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries that have entered into a concordat, or treaty, with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for the support of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. This support is in recompense, far inadequate indeed, for the sequestration of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> funds and <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and certain countries of Central and South America thus directly support the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, paying salaries to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, vicars-general, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, and assistants. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, as well as Cuba, <a href="../cathen/12291b.htm">Porto Rico</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, when under Spanish rule, did the same.

<p>Since the time of Constantine the right of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to possess temporal goods has been universally acknowledged and protected by civil governments with some exceptions. These exceptions refer chiefly to bequests and legacies. The possession by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of temporal goods and the surrendering of the same to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> for their sustenance gave rise to <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, the fruits or income of which constitute the chief provision for the maintenance of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> possessing them. The fruits of a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> will maintain the incumbent, even though he have private means of support. He should have not only what is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for sustenance, but sufficient for fitting recreation and hospitality, and a modest portion for future contingencies: he may also assist near relatives to some extent. If anything remain, it is to be used in charitable works. Ecclesiastical goods are not to be bequeathed in any considerable quantity to profane purposes. There are other methods in vogue for the support of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> akin to, or divisions of, those mentioned: <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> offerings, <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, quasi-contracts, state aid, and <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. Stipends for the application of Masses were originally intended for the daily maintenance of the celebrant. (For treatment of the Mass-stipend see <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">SACRIFICE OF THE MASS</a>.) It is in this latter sense that the word is mostly used at present, though it occasionally designates certain allowances made from <a href="../cathen/06157b.htm">ecclesiastical foundations</a> in favour of students seeking a more special or more profound training in the arts or <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">BENEFICE</a>; <a href="../cathen/05421b.htm">ENDOWMENT</a>; <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">TITHES</a>.)
