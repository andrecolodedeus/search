<h1>Stockholm</h1>  

<p>Stockholm, the capital of the Kingdom of Sweden, is situated on Lake Maelar at the spot where it opens into the Saltsj&ouml;, a rocky bay of the Baltic 59&ordm; 20' N. lat. The city, through which flows the short but fine river the Norrstr&ouml;m, is built partly on islands, partly on heights, on both banks of the river, from which there is a view over Maelar and the Saltsj&ouml;. It is claimed that Stockholm was founded by Birger Jarl (died 1266), and the <a href="../cathen/07243a.htm">coat of arms</a> of the city still bears the picture of King St. Eric (died 1160). The city has a population of 341,986 and is the court residence of the king and the seat of the government, of the diplomatic corps, and of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. The entrance to Stockholm is defended by the fortresses Oscar Fredriks Borg and Waxholm. It is the seat of the chief military authorities of the fourth and fifth military districts, including artillery, cavalry, infantry, and transport, and is a station of the fleet. As the capital it is the seat of the central administration of the kingdom, and contains the supreme court, the Svea upper court, the national royal bank, the mint, and exchange. As regards administration the city of Stockholm forms a separate district, which is ruled by a governor and is distinct from the Province of Stockholm (Stockholms l&auml;n). The city has burgomasters, magistrates, and a common council of one hundred members. The importance of the city in regard to commerce, manufactures, and shipping is shown by the following statistics of the year 1908: value of imports, 157,966,681 kronen; value of exports, 45,934,890 kronen; factories, 732, with 29,948 workmen and an output of the value of 166,540,075 kronen. The shipping trade of the city is carried on by 249 ships of 124,037 tons. The vessels over ten tons which call at the port of Stockholm number 36,338.

<p>Schools of higher learning in Stockholm are the H&ouml;gskola, a free college founded in 1878, the Caroline medico-surgical institute, founded in 1815, the military academy, the academy for the artillery and engineering corps, the academy for music (1771), the academy of <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a> (1773), the technical high school, and the commercial high school. The learned <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> are the Swedish Academy, with eighteen members, founded by Gustavus III in 1786; the Academy of Sciences, founded in 1739; the Nobel Institute, which has an endowment of over thirty million kronen; the Royal Library, containing over 300,000 volumes; and the observatory. The most important public buildings are the royal castle, built in the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> style, one of the finest works of the celebrated <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> architect Count Nicodemus Tessin the Younger (died 1728); the Parliament building; the House of the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> Nobility, where the council of nobles formerly met, built in the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> style of 1661; the royal opera house and royal theatre; the national museum, with picture and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> galleries; the Northern Museum, with collections to illustrate the ethnography and development in civilization of the Scandinavian peoples; the Skansen, a large open-air museum and zo&ouml;logical garden. The Northern Museum and the Skansen were founded by Dr. A. Hazelius (died 1901). The chief public <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> are those of Birger Jarl, Gustavus Vasa, Gustavus II Adolphus, Charles XII, and Charles XIII, both of these last mentioned <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> being in the "Kungstr&auml;dg&auml;rden", Gustavus III, Charles XIV, a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Linn&aelig;us in a park bearing his name, and one of Berzelius.

<p>Stockholm has very few buildings belonging to the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, as the finest of this era, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and churches, were either disfigured or torn down at the introduction of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Thus, for example, Gustavus Vasa had the churches of St. Mary Magdalen, St. Clara, and St. Jacob torn down; after his death they were rebuilt in the style of a later period. This king also caused the choir of the Church of St. Nicholas (Storkyrkan) to be shortened. This church, founded about 1260, is one of the finest monuments still in existence of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> period of Stockholm. The Riddarholm church, originally the church of a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, is the burial place of the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> kings. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> church buildings of Stockholm belong to a large number of different <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>. The State Church is <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>; among the other <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> represented are: the followers of Waldenstr&ouml;m, <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptists</a>, <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodists</a>, <a href="../cathen/08174a.htm">Irvingites</a>, <a href="../cathen/01166a.htm">Adventists</a>, the Salvation Army, <a href="../cathen/10570c.htm">Mormons</a>, etc. Many of the adherents of these <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> have not withdrawn officially from the State Church.

<p>There are in Stockholm about 1800 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> for whom there are two <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches, that of St. Eugenia, in Norra Smedjegatan, and that of St. Eric, in G&ouml;tgatan. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cemetery has a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> called St. Joseph's. The <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> for Sweden lives at St. Eric's; the present <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> is Dr. A. Bitter, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05093c.htm">Doliche</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are connected with both churches. A higher <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls is under the care of the French <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05388a.htm">Sisters of St. Elizabeth</a> devote themselves to the care of the sick and have also charge of two asylums, Oscars Minne and Jozefinahemet. It was not until recent times that the two <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> of Stockholm were built, St. Eugenia in 1837 and St. Eric in 1892, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> established. From the introduction of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> to the edict of toleration issued by Gustavus III in 1781 public <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship was forbidden. Mass could be said only in the private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of the foreign ambassadors at Stockholm, and attendance at these services was forbidden to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> under severe penalties. Conversion was punished by expulsion from the country and confiscation of goods. As late as 1858 six <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who had returned to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were expelled from the country. It was not until 1860 that a restricted religious liberty was granted in <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>. Thus, for example, institutions and foundations of <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> not belonging to the State Church cannot hold real estate in the country without royal permission. Monasteries are forbidden. By the royal edict of 1910 the names of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are to be entered in the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran Church</a> books by the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> of the State Church, and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> must apply to these <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> for their marriage certificates.
