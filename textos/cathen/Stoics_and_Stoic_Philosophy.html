<h1>Stoics and Stoic Philosophy</h1>  

<p>The Stoic School was founded in 322 B.C. by Zeno of Cittium and existed until the closing of the Athenian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (A.D. 429), (it took the name from the <em>Stoa poikile</em>, the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> hall or <a href="../cathen/04128c.htm">colonnade</a> in which the lectures were held.) Its history may be divided into three parts: (1)<em> Ancient Stoicism</em>; (2)<em> Middle Stoicism</em>; (3) <em>New Stoicism</em>.
<h2 id="section1">Ancient Stoicism (322-204)</h2>

<p>Zeno of Cittium (b. 366; d. in 280) was the disciple of Crates the Cynic and the academicians Stilpo, Xenocrates, and Polemon. After his death (264), Cleanthes of Assium (b. 331; d. 232) became head of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; Chrysippus of <a href="../cathen/14134a.htm">Soli</a> (b. 280), succeeded and was scholarch until 204. These <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, all of Oriental origin, lived in Athens where Zeno played a part in politics and were in communication with the principal men of their day. The Stoic <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, of which Zeno laid the foundations, was developed by Chrysippus in 705 treatises, of which only some fragments have been preserved. In addition to the principles accepted by all thinkers of their age (the perception of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, if it exists, can only be immediate; the wise man is self-sufficient; the political constitution is indifferent), derived from the <a href="../cathen/14145c.htm">Sophists</a> and the Cynics, they base the entire moral attitude of the wise man conformity to oneself and nature, indifference to external things on a comprehensive concept of nature, in part derived from Heraclitus, but inspired by an entirely new spirit. It is a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in a universal nature that is at one and the same time Fate infallibly regulating the course of events (<em>eimarmene, logos</em>); Zeus, or providence, the eternal principle of finality adapting all other things to the needs of rational beings; the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> determining the natural rules that govern the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and of the gods; the artistic fire, the expression of the active force which produced the world one, perfect, and complete from the beginning, with which it will be reunited through the universal conflagration, following a regular and ever recurring cycle. The popular gods are different forms of this force, described allegorically in myths. This view of nature is the basis for the optimism of the Stoic moral system; confidence in the instinctive faculties, which, in the absence of a perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the world, ought to guide man's actions; and again, the infallible wisdom of the sage, which Chrysippus tries to establish by a dialectic derived from <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> and the Cynics. But this optimism requires them to solve the following problems: the origin of the passions and the vices; the conciliation of fate and liberty; the origin of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the world. On the last two subjects they propounded, all the arguments that were advanced later up to the time of Leibniz.
<h2 id="section2">Middle Stoicism (second and first centuries B.C.)</h2>

<p>Stoicism during this period was no longer a Greek <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; it had penetrated into the Roman world and had become, under the influence of Scipio's friend, Pan&#230;tius (185-112), who lived in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and of Posidonius, (135-40) who transferred the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> to <a href="../cathen/13024b.htm">Rhodes</a>, the quasi-official philosophy of Roman imperialism. Its doctrines were considerably modified, becoming less dogmatic in consequence of the criticism of the new Academician, Carneades (215-129). In Stoic morality, Pan&#230;tius develops the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of humanity. Posidonius at once a savant, historian, geographer, mathematician, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a> and a mystic who commenting on <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> works, revives his theories on the nature and destiny of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.
<h2 id="section3">New Stoicism (to A.D. 429)</h2>

<p>The new Stoicism is more <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> and didactic. Science is no longer the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of nature, but a kind of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <em>summa</em> of moral and religious sentiments. Very little has been preserved of the short popular treatises and discourses, wherein a vivid style introduced under the influence of the Cynic diatribe, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> endeavored to render his <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> principles practical. The letters of Seneca (2-68) to Lucilius, the conversations of Musonius (time of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>), and of Epictetus (age of <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>), the fragments of Hierodcles (time of Hadrian), the members of <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a> (d. 180), give but an incomplete <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. Stoicism, which generally disappeared as the official School, was the most important of the Hellenistic elements in the semi-oriental <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> of vanishing <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>.
