<h1>Strasburg</h1>  

<p>(ARGENTINENSIS)

<p>A German diocese immediately dependent on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Papal See</a>. According to legend the Diocese of Strasburg was founded in the third or fourth century. <a href="../cathen/01686a.htm">St. Arbogast</a> and Florentius were distinguished <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the sixth or seventh century. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> known to history is Ansoald, one of the signers of the Acts of the Council of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> of 614. His successor Eddo or Heddo, of the ducal <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Ettichos, organized his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> diocese in conjunction with <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, aided by the Carlovingians. The boundaries then given remained essentially the same throughout the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. On the left bank of the Rhine the diocese extended over the present Province of Alsace with exception of the south-eastern part between the Ill, Blind, and Rhine; on the right bank it extended from the Rhine to the crest of the Black Forest, and southward from the mouth of the Murg to the Elz. This territory was divided into seven archdiaconates, of which one included Strasburg, and one the region on the right bank of the Rhine. This subdivision remained substantially the same from the eleventh century to the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> granted Bishop Heddo unlimited <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the valley of the Breusch, and in 775 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> received freedom from customs <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> throughout the empire for himself and his vassals (<em>homines ecclesiae</em>). By the Treaty of Verdun (843) the Diocese of Strasburg fell to the empire of Lothair; in 870 it became part of the east <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom, later the Holy Roman Empire, so that the German character of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was preserved. Both Lothair and Louis the German confirmed the privileges that their forefathers had granted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Strasburg. Bishops Udo (950-65) and Erchanbald (965-91) restored Church discipline which had fallen into decay at the beginning of the tenth century. <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Emperor Otto I</a> granted Udo the ownership of the royal mint at Strasburg; <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a> (974) confirmed this gift and gave the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to establish a mint in any town of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> he desired. In 982 <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a> granted Erchanbald absolute <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the city of Strasburg and its environs, thus forming the main foundation of the secular supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Werner I of Habsburg (1001-29) received from emperors Henry II and Conrad II a large number of grants including the old Abbey of St. Stephen with all its <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. A new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, to replace the one destroyed in 1002 by Hermann of Swabia, was begun by Werner I in 1015 and dedicated in 1031. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> gave to the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the minster numerous <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> which he had collected in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/08084c.htm">conflict of investitures</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> generally sided with the imperial party: Werner II (1065-79); Theobald (1079-82), who took part in the election of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Clement III</a>; and Otto of Hohenstaufen (1082-1100), who accompanied <a href="../cathen/06624b.htm">Godfrey of Bouillon</a> on the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section1">First Crusade</a>. Gebhard I (1131-41) and Burkhard I (1141-62) were <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> promoters of Church reform; during the episcopate of Berthold I of Teck (1223-44), about 1230, the new orders of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> settled at Strasburg.

<p>The city of Strasburg developed under episcopal administration, and in the twelfth century it prospered greatly. Its efforts to abolish episcopal suzerainty and to obtain new privileges were especially successful during the <a href="../cathen/08084c.htm">Conflict of Investitures</a>. The town-council acquired great independence and the right of co-optation, although the right of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to appoint the council had been reconfirmed in 1214 by charter of <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a>. At the beginning of his episcopate Walter of Geroldseck (1260-63) wished to enforce this right, to dispose of communal <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and to regulate the taxes. The populace, siding with the council and the patricians, defeated the episcopal forces at Hausberger, 8 March, 1262, thus practically establishing the independence of the city. The succeeding <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Henry of Geroldseck (1263-73), made a treaty in 1263 by which at the close of the official year the council elected its own successors, and the citizens themselves had the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to settle all questions regarding communal <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> retained only the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to appoint the town magistrate, the castellan of the castle, the official in charge of the collection of the customs, and the superintendent of the mint. These offices, except that of magistrate, gradually sank in importance, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> no longer appointed the officials. Conrad of Lichtenberg (1273-99) completed the rebuilding in <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> of the minster, and began the construction of the beautiful west <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>. Bishops Johannes of Dirpheim (1306-28), chancellor of King Albert II, and Berthold II of Bucheck (1328-53) were both capable administrators, appointed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Notwithstanding their share in imperial politics, these <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> found time to hold <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> and labour effectually for church discipline in the diocese.

<p>In 1359 John II of Lichtenberg (1353-65) obtained the Landgraviate of Lower Alsace from the Counts of Oettingen. A land-register, that gave exact information concerning the secular possessions of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, was drawn up during his administration. The diocese included: in Lower Alsace the districts of Benfield, Markolsheim, Schirmeck, Dachstein, Kochersberg, Wanzemau, and Zabern; in Upper Alsace the stewardship of Rufach; in the present Duchy of Baden the districts of Oberjirch and Ettenheim. The episcopal possessions in Alsace were only exceeded in area by those of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>. With shrewd policy the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had opportunely broken the power of the local governors, and had successfully opposed the restoration of imperial administrative suzerainty over <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> territories. Under John's successors began the decline of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, promoted by unhappy political conditions and by the Great Schism. This decay was especially rapid during the episcopate of William of Diest (1394-1439), who, to carry on innumerable private and public <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, frequently mortgaged and squandered the episcopal lands. His successors, who, with the aid of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, finally paid off his <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a>, were: Rupert of the Pfalz (1440-78), who called the celebrated preacher <a href="../cathen/06403c.htm">Geiler von Kaysersberg</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> of the minster; Albert of the Pfalz (1478-1506); and William III of Honstein (1507-41).



<p>Soon after 1520 the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> gained many adherents in the city of Strasburg, owing to the labours of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> friends, Wolfgang Capito and Martin <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Bucer</a>, the efforts of the preacher Matthias Zell and of the Humanists Sturm and Hedio. In 1529 the council abolished the Mass; in 1531 the city joined the Smalkaldic League, whereupon the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, transferred his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to Zabern. Despite the rigorous opposition of William of Honstein and <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> of <a href="../cathen/09260a.htm">Limburg</a> (1541-68), all the secular lordships of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in Lower Alsace adopted the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, except the landgraviate; even part of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter became <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. John IV of Manderscheid-Blankenheim (1569-92) summoned the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to Molsheim to check the apostasy and encouraged the <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a>. After his death there was a double election: the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> canons chose John George of Brandenburg as administrator; the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> canons, Cardinal Charles of Lorraine. The struggle between the two candidates, called the Bishops' War of Strasburg (1592-1604), caused the diocese great misery. Charles of Lorraine was victor. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ownership was further secured in the successive election of two Austrian archdukes as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>: Leopold (1607-25), a brother of Emperor Ferdinand II, and Leopold William (1625-62), one of Ferdinand's sons. During the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a> the territory was so ravaged by Ernst of Mansfeld, the Swedes, and the French, that the population decreased 75 per cent. In 1680, during the episcopate of Charles Egon of F&uuml;rstenberg (1663-82), whose sympathies were French, <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> seized all the territory of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> on the left bank of the Rhine under pretence of "reunion"; the city of Strasburg became a French possession in 1681. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> retained the internal administration of his possessions in Alsace and the title of landgrave. The districts on the right bank of the Rhine remained within the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was still their ruler as prince of the empire. The occupation of Strasburg by the French brought the minster once more into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. William Egon of F&uuml;rstenberg (1682-1704) established the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at Strasburg and placed the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in charge of it. The succeeding four <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> belonged to the French princely <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of de Rohan; the last of these, Louis Rene de Rohan (1779-1802), was involved in the <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> affair of the diamond necklace. In 1790 the Constituent National Assembly secularized the Alsatian possessions of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and Rohan transferred his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to the German portion of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. In Strasburg Brendel, a constitutional <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was elected; Eulogius Schneider, whom he appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who refused to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, until the overthrow of the Reign of Terror in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> put an end to this <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>.

<p>By the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a> the Diocese of Strasburg received new boundaries, extending the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> over and beyond Alsace to the Lake of Bienne in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and south-westerly as far as Montbeliard. Rohan having resigned at the request of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, Peter Saurine (1802-13), former constitutional <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Strasburg. The districts on the right bank of the Rhine fell to Baden on account of the secularization of the German Church in 1803. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which had been a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> until 1802, became (1822) a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>; it was reduced in size towards the south and south-west. Bishop Andreas Raess (1842-87) endeavoured to revive <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, to promote the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and to establish religious associations. When Alsace became a German possession in 1871, the diocese received its present extent and was declared directly dependent on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> by Decrees of 10 and 14 July, 1874, and by the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> of 7 October, 1874. Raess was succeeded by Peter Paul Stumpf (1887-90), and the present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Adolf Fritzen, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 21 July, 1891. Bishop Fritzen has especially encouraged <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> associations, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> press, Church liturgy and psalmody. In 1902 he established a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of Strasburg.
<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>The Diocese of Strasburg includes the departments of Upper and Lower Alsace in the German Crown-Province of Alsace-Lorraine. In 1911 it contained 57 deaneries, 710 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 283 curacies, 710 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 454 <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curates</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> in other positions, 92 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> retired or on leave elsewhere, 106 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regulars</a>, and 846,100 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> while 350,000 of the population belonged to other faiths. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is appointed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in agreement with the German Emperor, and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter is appointed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In regard to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, see <a href="../cathen/01341c.htm">ALSACE-LORRAINE</a>. The most important church is the minster at Strasburg, the oldest parts of which belong to the eleventh century. The <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> is Romanesque, the upper part of the choir and the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a> belong to the Transition period, the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> is Gothic. The famous <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> is the chief work of <a href="../cathen/05526b.htm">Erwin of Steinbach</a> (1284-1318). The north tower, about 465 feet high, was completed in 1429-39 by Johann H&uuml;ltz of Cologne. The minster is rich in <a href="../cathen/14241a.htm">stained glass</a> of the period from the twelfth to the fifteenth century. Other churches are: St. Martin at Colmar, St. George at Schlettstadt, <a href="../cathen/14567b.htm">St. Theobald</a> at Thann, St. Nicholas at Hagenau, <a href="../cathen/09174a.htm">St. Leodegar</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Our Lady at Gebweiler, Old and New St. Peter at Strasburg, etc. Much frequented places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> are: Drei Aehren near Colmar, St. Odilien near Barr, Dusenbach near Rappoltsweiler, St. Morand near Altkirch, etc.
