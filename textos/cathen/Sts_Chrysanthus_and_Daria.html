<h1>Sts. Chrysanthus and Daria</h1>  

<p>Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, buried on the Via Salaria Nova, and whose <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a>, according to the testimony of the itinerary guides to the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, were publicly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> (<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, "Roma Sotterranea", I, 176). A church erected over the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> was situated near that of <a href="../cathen/13486b.htm">St. Saturninus</a>, which was built over the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of Thraso (<em>coemeterium Thrasonis ad S. Saturnium</em>). Their <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> was in fact in a disused sandpit (arenaria) near this <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a>. The two <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were revered in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the fourth century, as the appearance of their names in the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum" proves. The existing Acts of these Martyrs are without historical value; they did not originate until the fifth century, and are compiled in two texts--a longer one, written originally in Greek, but afterwards translated into Latin, and a shorter one in Latin. The historical notices of Chrysanthus and Daria in the so-called historical <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> of the West, as in the Greek synaxaria, go back to the legend which makes Chrysanthus the son of the noble Polemius of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. He came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> and was converted by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Carpophorus. Everything was done to make him <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a>. Daria, a beautiful and very intelligent Vestal, entered into relations with him, but she herself was won over to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> by Chrysanthus, and both concluded a virginal matrimonial union. Many Romans and Roman ladies were converted by these, among them the Tribune Claudius, his wife Hilaria and two sons Maurus and Jason, all of whom, with the exception of the mother, suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Chrysanthus and Daria were themselves condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>, led to a sandpit in the Via Salaria, and there stoned to death.

<p>This legend is evidently connected with a number of Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> were <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> of the Via Salaria, near those of Chrysanthus and Daria. The story, apart from the assured fact of their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> and the veneration of their <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a>, has, perhaps, some historical value, in assigning the date to the reign of the Emperor Numerianus (283-84). As this ruler was never in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, some historians believe (for instance, Allard; see below) that the name is <a href="../cathen/15256b.htm">Valerianus</a>, and transfer the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> under this emperor. But perhaps the name of Numerianus ought to be adhered to, and the origin of this indication is to be found in the legend of an Oriental <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> having the same name. There is another <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> closely connected with the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, which is related at the end of the Acts of these <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. After the death of the Chrysantus and Daria, when many of the faithful of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were assembled at their <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> to celebrate the anniversary of their death, they were surprised by the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a>, who filled in with stones and earth the subterranean <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> where the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were assembled, so that all perished. Later, when the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Sts. Chrysanthus and Daria was looked for and found, the bones of these <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and even the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> silver vessels, which they used for the celebration of the Eucharist, were also discovered. Everything was left as it was found, and a wall was erected so that no one could enter the place. Only through a window-opening in the wall could be seen the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Sts. Chrysanthus and Daria, as well as the bones of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> killed in the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. This <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, like so many others, was embellished by Pope Damasus, who had poems in praise of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> engraved on marble and placed there. <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> describes this sanctuary in an interesting chapter of his "De gloria martyrum", I, xxxviii (P.L., LXXI, 739). During the invasions of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> the sanctuary was <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecrated</a>, but later it was restored, as a metrical inscription composed at that time and falsely attributed to Pope Damasus asserts. In the ninth century the remains of Sts. Chrysanthus and Daria were brought to Pr&uuml;m and were thence transferred to Munstereifel in <a href="../cathen/11415b.htm">Rhenish Prussia</a>, where they are still greatly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of these <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> stands in the Roman Martyrology on the 25th of October, on which day, also, it appears in some <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the seventh century. In the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum" the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were mentioned on 12 August and 29 November; according to some <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, on other days also. The Greeks celebrate their feast on 19 March.
