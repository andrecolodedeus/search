<h1>Sts. Crispin and Crispinian</h1>  

<p>Martyrs of the Early Church who were beheaded during the reign of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>; the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of their execution is given as 25 October, 285 or 286. It is stated that they were brothers, but the fact has not been positively <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. The legend relates that they were Romans of distinguished descent who went as missionaries of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> to Gaul and chose <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a> as their field of labour. In imitation of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> they worked with their hands, making shoes, and earned enough by their trade to support themselves and also to aid the poor. During the <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> they were brought before <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Maximianus Herculius</a> whom <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> had appointed co-emperor. At first <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Maximianus</a> sought to turn them from their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by alternate promises and threats. But they replied: "Thy threats do not terrify us, for Christ is our life, and death is our gain. Thy rank and possessions are nought to us, for we have long before this sacrificed the like for the sake of Christ and rejoice in what we have done. If thou shouldst acknowledge and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Christ thou wouldst give not only all the treasures of this life, but even the glory of thy crown itself in order through the exercise of compassion to win eternal life." When <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Maximianus</a> saw that his efforts were of no avail, he gave Crispin and Crispinian into the hands of the governor Rictiovarus (Rictius Varus), a most cruel persecutor of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Under the order of Rictiovarus they were stretched on the rack, thongs were cut from their flesh, and awls were driven under their finger-nails. A millstone was then fastened about the neck of each, and they were thrown into the Aisne, but they were able to swim to the opposite bank of the river. In the same manner they suffered no harm from a great fire in which Rictiovarus, in despair, sought death himself. Afterwards the two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were beheaded at the command of <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Maximianus</a>.

<p>This is the story of the legend which the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> have incorporated in their great collection; the same account is found in various breviaries. The narrative says that a large church was built over the graves of the two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, consequently the legend could not have arisen until a later age; it contains, moreover, many details that have little probability or historical worth and seems to have been compiled from various fabulous sources. In the sixth century a stately basilica was erected at <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a> over the graves of these <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05386a.htm">St. Eligius</a>, a famous goldsmith, made a costly shrine for the head of St. Crispinian. Some of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of Crispin and Crispinian were carried to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and placed in the church of San Lorenzo in Panisperna. Other <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were given by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, dedicated to Crispin and Crispinian, which he founded at <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>. Crispin and Crispinian are the <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saints</a> of shoemakers, saddlers, and tanners. Their feast falls on 25 October.
