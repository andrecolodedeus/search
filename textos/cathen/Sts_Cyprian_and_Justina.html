<h1>Sts. Cyprian and Justina</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Antioch who suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> at <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, 26 September, 304, the date in September being afterwards made the day of their feast. Cyprian was a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> magician of Antioch who had dealing with demons. By their aid he sought to bring St. Justina, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> virgin, to ruin; but she foiled the threefold attacks of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> by the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>. Brought to despair Cyprian made the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> himself and in this way was freed from the toils of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. He was received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, was made pre-eminent by <a href="../cathen/03588e.htm">miraculous gifts</a>, and became in succession <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and finally <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, while Justina became the head of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> both were seized and taken to Damascus where they were shockingly tortured. As their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> never wavered they were brought before <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> at <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, where at his command they were beheaded on the bank of the river Gallus. The same fate befell a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, Theoctistus, who had come to Cyprian and had embraced him. After the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> had lain unburied for six days they were taken by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sailors to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where they were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> on the estate of a noble lady named Rufina and later were entombed in Constantine's basilica. This is the outline of the legend or allegory which is found, adorned with diffuse descriptions and dialogues, in the unreliable <a href="../cathen/10225a.htm">"Symeon Metaphrastes"</a>, and was made the subject of a poem by the Empress Eudocia II. The story, however, must have arisen as early as the fourth century, for it is mentioned both by <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a> and Prudentius; both, nevertheless, have confounded our Cyprian with <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian of Carthage</a>, a mistake often repeated. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> bore the name of Cyprian. The attempt has been made to find in Cyprian a mystical prototype of the Faust legend: <a href="../cathen/03156a.htm">Calderon</a> took the story as the basis of a drama: "El magico prodigioso". The legend is given in Greek and Latin in Acta SS. September, VII. Ancient Syriac and <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a> versions of it have been published within the last few years.
