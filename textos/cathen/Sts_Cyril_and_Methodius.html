<h1>Sts. Cyril and Methodius</h1>  

<p>(Or CONSTANTINE and METHODIUS).

<p>These brothers, the Apostles of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, were born in <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, in 827 and 826 respectively. Though belonging to a senatorial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> they renounced secular <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honours</a> and became <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. They were living in a <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">monastery</a> on the Bosphorous, when the Khazars sent to Constantinople for a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> teacher. Cyril was selected and was accompanied by his brother. They learned the Khazar language and <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> many of the people. Soon after the Khazar mission there was a request from the <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravians</a> for a preacher of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. German missionaries had already laboured among them, but without success. The <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravians</a> wished a teacher who could instruct them and conduct <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Divine service</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14041b.htm">Slavonic tongue</a>. On account of their acquaintance with the language, Cyril and Methodius were chosen for their work. In preparation for it Cyril invented an alphabet and, with the help of Methodius, translated the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and the necessary <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> into <a href="../cathen/14041b.htm">Slavonic</a>. They went to <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a> in 863, and laboured for four and a half years. Despite their success, they were regarded by the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> with distrust, first because they had come from Constantinople where <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> was rife, and again because they held the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> services in the <a href="../cathen/14041b.htm">Slavonic language</a>. On this account the brothers were summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a>, who died, however, before their arrival. His <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">successor</a>, <a href="../cathen/01156a.htm">Adrian II</a>, received them kindly. Convinced of their <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, he commended their missionary activity, sanctioned the <a href="../cathen/14041b.htm">Slavonic Liturgy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> Cyril and Methodius <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Cyril, however, was not to return to <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a>. He died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 4 Feb., 869.

<p>At the request of the <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravian</a> princes, Rastislav and Svatopluk, and the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> Prince Kocel of Pannonia, <a href="../cathen/01156a.htm">Adrian II</a> formed an Archdiocese of Moravia and Pannonia, made it independent of the German <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and appointed Methodius <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. In 870 King Louis and the German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> summoned Methodius to a synod at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. Here he was deposed and condemned to prison. After three years he was liberated at the command of <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">Pope John VIII</a> and reinstated as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a>. He zealously endeavoured to spread the Faith among the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a>, and also among the Poles in Northern <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a>. Soon, however, he was summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> again in consequence of the allegations of the German <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Wiching, who impugned his <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, and objected to the use of <a href="../cathen/14041b.htm">Slavonic</a> in the liturgy. But <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a>, after an inquiry, sanctioned the <a href="../cathen/14041b.htm">Slavonic Liturgy</a>, decreeing, however, that in the <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> the <a href="../cathen/06659a.htm">Gospel</a> should be read first in <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> and then in <a href="../cathen/14041b.htm">Slavonic</a>. Wiching, in the meantime, had been <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nominated</a> one of the suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Methodius. He continued to oppose his <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, going so far as to produce spurious <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">papal letters</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">pope</a>, however, assured Methodius that they were <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Methodius went to Constantinople about this time, and with the assistance of several <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, he completed the translation of the <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">Holy Scriptures</a>, with the exception of the <a href="../cathen/09495a.htm">Books of Machabees</a>. He translated also the <a href="../cathen/11094a.htm">"Nomocanon"</a>, i.e. the Greek ecclesiastico-<a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>. The enemies of Methodius did not cease to antagonize him. His health was worn out from the long struggle, and he died 6 April, 885, recommending as his <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">successor</a> Gorazd, a <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravian</a> <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> who had been his disciple.

<p>Formerly the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of Saints Cyril and Methodius was celebrated in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a> on 9 March; but <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> changed the date to 5 July. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, by his <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Grande Munus" of 30 September, 1880, extended the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> to the universal <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. [<em>Note:</em> The <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of Sts. Cyril and Methodius is currently celebrated on February 14 in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>.]
