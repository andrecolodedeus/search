<h1>Sts. Cyrus and John</h1>  

<p>Celebrated <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of the Coptic Church, surnamed <em>thaumatourgoi anargyroi</em> because they healed the sick gratis (<a href="../cathen/11078a.htm">Nilles</a>, Kallendarium utriusque Ecclesi&aelig;, Innsbruck, 1896, I, 89). Their <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a> is celebrated by the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> on the sixth day of Emsir, corresponding to 31 January, the day also observed by the Greeks; on the same day they are commemorated in the Roman Martyrology, regarding which see the observation of Cardinal Baronio (Martyrologium Romanum, Venice, 1586). The Greeks celebrate also the finding and translation of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> on 28 June (see "Menologium Basil." and "Menaia"). The principal source of information regarding the life, passion and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of Sts. John and Cyrus is the encomium written by Sophronius, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (d. 638). Of the birth, <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and first years of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing. According to the Arabic "Synaxarium" (Forget, Synax. Alexandrinum, <a href="../cathen/02392a.htm">Beirut</a>, 1906, II, 252), compiled by Michael, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Athrib and Malig, Cyrus and John were both Alexandrians; this, however, is contradicted by other documents in which it is said that Cyrus was a native of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and John of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>. Cyrus practised the art of medicine, and had a work-shop (<em>ergasterium</em>) which was afterwards transformed into a temple dedicated to the three boy-saints, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias. He ministered to the sick gratis and at the same time laboured with all the ardour of an apostle of the Faith, and won many from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>. This took place under the <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Emperor Diocletian</a>. Denounced to the prefect of the city he fled to Arabia of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> where he took refuge in a town near the sea called Tzoten. There, having shaved his head and assumed the monastic habit, he abandoned medicine and began a life of asceticism.

<p>John belonged to the army, in which he held a high rank; the "Synaxarium" cited above adds that he was one of the familiars of the emperor. Hearing of the virtues and wonders of Cyrus, he betook himself to Jerusalem in fulfillment of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, and thence passed into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> where he became the companion of St. Cyrus in the ascetic life. During the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> three holy virgins, Theoctista (Theopista), fifteen years old, Theodota (Theodora), thirteen years old, and Theodossia (Theodoxia), eleven years old, together with their mother Athanasia, were arrested at <a href="../cathen/03297b.htm">Canopus</a> and brought to Alexandria. Cyrus and John, fearing lest these girls, on account of their tender age, might, in the midst of torments, deny the Faith, resolved to go into the city to comfort them and encourage them in undergoing <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. This fact becoming known they also were arrested and after dire torments they were all beheaded on the 31st of January. The bodies of the two <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were placed in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Mark the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> where they remained up to the time of St. Cyril, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a> (412-444). At Menuthis (<em>Menouthes</em> or <em>Menouthis</em>) near Canopus there existed at that time a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> temple reputed for its oracles and cures which attracted even some simple <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the vicinity. St. Cyril thought to extirpate this <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> cult by establishing in that town the cultus of Sts. Cyrus and John. For this purpose he transferred thither their <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> (28 June, 414) and placed them in the church built by his predecessor, Theophilus, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>. Before the finding and transfer of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> by St. Cyril it seems that the names of the two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were unknown; certain it is that no written records of them existed (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G., LXXXVII, 3508 sq.). In the fifth century, during the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a>, their <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were brought to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by two <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, Grimaldus and Arnulfus&mdash;this according to a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> in the archives of the deaconry of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> in the Via Lata, cited by Antonio Bosio (Roma Sotterranea, Rome, 1634, p. 123). <a href="../cathen/09538a.htm">Mai</a>, however, for historical reasons, justly assigns a later date, namely 634, under Pope Honorius and the Emperor Heraclius (Spicilegium Rom., III, V). The <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were placed in the suburban church of St. Passera (Abbas Cyrus) on the Via Portuense. In the time of Bosio the pictures of the two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were still visible in this church (Bosio, op. cit., ib.) Upon the door of the hypogeum, which still remains, is the following inscription in marble:--

<blockquote><p>Corpora sancta Cyri renitent hic atque Joannis<br> Qu&aelig; quondam Rom&aelig; dedit Alexandria magna</p></blockquote>

<p>(Bosio, ib.; <a href="../cathen/09538a.htm">Mai</a>, Spic. Rom., loc. cit.). At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> three churches were dedicated to these <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, Abbas Cyrus de Militiis, Abbas Cyrus de Valeriis, and Abbas Cyrus ad Elephantum&mdash;all of which were transformed afterwards by the vulgar pronunciation into S. Passera, a corruption of Abbas Cyrus; in the Coptic Difnar, Apakiri, Apakyri, Apakyr; in Arabic, 'Abaqir, 'Abuqir (see Armellini, Le Chiese di Roma, Rome, 1891, 179 sq., 563 sq., 681, 945 sq.).
