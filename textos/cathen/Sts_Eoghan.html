<h1>Sts. Eoghan</h1>  

<p>(1) EOGHAN OF ARDSTRAW was a native of Leinster, and, after presiding over the Abbey of Kilnamanagh (Co. Wicklow) for fifteen years, settled in the valley of Mourne (Co. Tyrone), his mother's country, about the year 576. He was followed by many disciples including <a href="../cathen/04092c.htm">St. Kevin of Glendalough</a>, who completed his studies under this saint. As a boy he had been carried off to Britain, and subsequently he was taken captive to Brittany, together with St. Tighernach, who is best known as the founder of the abbey of Clones, Co. Monaghan. So great was the fame of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and learning of St. Eoghan, at Mourne, that he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ardstraw about the year 581. It is difficult to give his <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> with any degree of exactness, but the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalists</a> give the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death as 23 Aug., 618. His name is generally latinized as Eugenius, but the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> form is <em>Eoghan</em> (Owen), hence <em>Tir Eoghain</em>, or Tyrone.

<p>Ardstraw continued as an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> until 1150, when it was translated to Rathlure and subsequently to Maghera, but in 1254 it was definitely removed to Derry. In all these changes St. Eoghan was regarded as the clan patron, and hence he is the tutelary guardian of the <a href="../cathen/04742a.htm">See of Derry</a> to this day. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 23 August.

<p>(2) EOGHAN OF CLONCULLEN, Co. Tipperary, has been identified with Eoghan, son of Saran of Cloncullen, for whom <a href="../cathen/01234b.htm">St. Ailbe of Emly</a> composed a rule. He is entered in the Martyrologies of Tallaght and Donegal, and is venerated on 15 March.

<p>(3) EOGHAN, Bishop, is commemorated in the Martyrology of Tallaght on 18 April, and is included by the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> under that date, but the particulars of his life are scanty in the extreme.

<p>(4) EOGHAN THE SAGE (Sapiens) finds a place in the Irish martyrologies, and he is also included in the <a href="../cathen/01111d.htm">"Acta Sanctorum"</a>, but no reliable data as to his life is forthcoming. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 28 May.

<p>(5) EOGHAN OF CRANFIELD (Co. Antrim) has been described as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Moville, but there is reason to believe that he is to be identified with the preceding saint of the same name, especially as the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> style him <em>Episcopus et Sapiens de-Magh-cremhcaille</em>. A St. Ernan of Cremhcaille (Cranfield) is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> on 31 May, but this is also the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a> of St. Eoghan. However, "Ernan" may be a scribal <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> for "Eoghan", and this would account for the seeming mistake of name in regard to the patron of Cranfield.

<p>There are other Irish <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of this name, but their history is somewhat obscure, and it is not easy to reconcile their chronology.
