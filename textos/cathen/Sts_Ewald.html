<h1>Sts. Ewald</h1>  

<p>(Or HEWALD)

<p>Martyrs in Old Saxony about 695. They were two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and natives of Northumbria, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Both bore the same name, but were distinguished as Ewald the Black and Ewald the Fair, from the difference in the colour of their hair and complexions. According to the example of many at that time, they spent several years as students in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Ewald the Black was the more learned of the two, but both were equally renowned for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of life. They were apparently acquainted with <a href="../cathen/15645a.htm">St. Willibrord</a>, the Apostle of Friesland, and were animated with his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>. Indeed, by some they have been actually numbered among the eleven companions of that saint, but it is more probable they did not set out from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> till after St. Willibrord's departure. They entered upon their mission about 690. The scene of their labours was the country of the ancient Saxons, now part of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, and covered by the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of M&uuml;nster, <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>. At first the Ewalds took up their abode in the house of the steward of a certain Saxon earl or ealdormen (satrapa). <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> remarks that "the old Saxons have no king, but they are governed by several ealdormen [satrapas] who during <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> cast lots for leadership, but who in time of peace are equal in power" (Hist. Eccl., V, 10). The steward entertained his two guests for several days, and promised to conduct them to the chieftain, as they affirmed they had a message of considerable importance to deliver to him.

<p>Meanwhile, the Ewalds omitted nothing of their religious exercises. They <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> often, recited the <a href="../cathen/07500b.htm">canonical hours</a>, and celebrated <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>, for they carried with them all that was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> Saxons, understanding from these things that they had <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and missionaries in their midst, began to suspect that their aim was to convert their over-lord, and thus destroy their <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> and their religion. Inflamed with jealousy and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, they resolved that the Ewalds should die. Ewald the Fair they quickly despatched with the sword, but Ewald the Black they subjected to torture, because he was the spokesman and showed greater boldness. He was torn limb from limb, after which the two bodies were cast into the Rhine. This is understood to have happened on 3 October at a place called Aplerbeck, where a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> still stands.

<p>When the ealdorman heard of what had been done he was exceedingly angry, and took vengeance by ordering the murderers to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> and their village to be destroyed by fire. Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> bodies were <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> carried against the stream up the Rhine, for the space of forty miles, to the place in which the companions of the Ewalds were residing. As they floated along, a heavenly light, like a column of fire, was seen to shine above them. Even the murderers are said to have witnessed the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> brightness. Moreover, one of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> appeared in vision to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Tilmon (a companion of the Ewalds), and told him where the bodies would be found: "that the spot would be there where he should see a pillar of light reaching from earth to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>". Tilmon arose and found the bodies, and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> them with the honours due to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. From that time onwards, the memory of the Ewalds was annually celebrated in those parts. A spring of water is said to have gushed forth in the place of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.

<p>Pepin, Duke of Austrasia, having heard of the wonders that had occurred, caused the bodies to be translated to <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, where they were solemnly enshrined in the collegiate <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Cunibert. The heads of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were bestowed on Frederick, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, by Archbishop Anno of Cologne, at the opening of the shrine in 1074. These <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were probably destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a> in 1534. When St. Norbert visited Cologne, in 1121, he obtained two small vessels containing the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of several <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and among them were bones of the sainted Ewalds. These were deposited either at <a href="../cathen/12392a.htm">Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;</a>, or at Florennes, a <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the province of <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a>. The two Ewalds are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as patrons in <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, and are mentioned in the Roman Martyrology on 3 October. Their <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Cologne and M&uuml;nster.
