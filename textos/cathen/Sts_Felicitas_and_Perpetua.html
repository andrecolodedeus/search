<h1>Sts. Felicitas and Perpetua</h1>  

<p>Martyrs, suffered at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, 7 March 203, together with three companions, Revocatus, Saturus, and Saturninus. The details of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of these five confessors in the North African Church have reached us through a genuine, contemporary description, one of the most affecting accounts of the glorious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in ancient times. By a <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> of Septimus Severus (193-211) all imperial subjects were forbidden under severe penalties to become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. In consequence of this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, five <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> at Carthage were seized and cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, viz. Vibia Perpetua, a young married lady of noble birth; the slave Felicitas, and her fellow-slave Revocatus, also Saturninus and Secundulus. Soon one Saturus, who deliberately declared himself a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> before the judge, was also incarcerated. Perpetua's father was a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>; her mother, however, and two brothers were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, one being still a <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a>; a third brother, the child Dinocrates, had died a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>.

<p>After their arrest, and before they were led away to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, the five <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. The sufferings of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> life, the attempts of Perpetua's father to induce her to <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a>, the vicissitudes of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> before their execution, the visions of Saturus and Perpetua in their dungeons, were all faithfully committed to writing by the last two. Shortly after the death of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> added to this document an account of their execution. The darkness of their <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and the oppressive atmosphere seemed frightful to Perpetua, whose terror was increased by anxiety for her young child. Two <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> succeeded, by sufficiently bribing the jailer, in gaining admittance to the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and alleviated somewhat their sufferings. Perpetua's mother also, and her brother, yet a <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a>, visited them. Her mother brought in her arms to Perpetua her little son, whom she was permitted to nurse and retain in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> with her. A vision, in which she saw herself ascending a ladder leading to green meadows, where a flock of sheep was browsing, assured her of her approaching <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.

<p>A few days later Perpetua's father, hearing a rumour that the trial of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> would soon take place, again visited their dungeon and besought her by everything dear to her not to put this disgrace on her name; but Perpetua remained steadfast to her Faith. The next day the trial of the six confessors took place, before the Procurator Hilarianus. All six resolutely confessed their <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>. Perpetua's father, carrying her child in his arms, approached her again and attempted, for the last time, to induce her to <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> also remonstrated with her but in vain. She refused to sacrifice to the gods for the safety of the emperor. The <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> thereupon had the father removed by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">force</a>, on which occasion he was struck with a whip. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were then condemned to be torn to pieces by wild beasts, for which they gave thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In a vision Perpetua saw her brother Dinocrates, who had did at the early age of seven, at first seeming to be sorrowful and in pain, but shortly thereafter <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> and healthy. Another apparition, in which she saw herself fighting with a savage Ethiopian, whom she conquered, made it clear to her that she would not have to do battle with wild beasts but with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a>. Saturus, who also wrote down his visions, saw himself and Perpetua transported by four <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, towards the East to a beautiful garden, where they met four other <a href="../cathen/01191a.htm">North African Christians</a> who had suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> during the same <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, viz. Jocundus, Saturninus, Artaius, and Quintus. He also saw in this vision Bishop Optatus of Carthage and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Aspasius, who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> to arrange a reconciliation between them. In the meanwhile the birthday festival of the Emperor Geta approached, on which occasion the condemned <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were to fight with wild beasts in the military games; they were therefore transferred to the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> in the camp. The jailer Pudens had learnt to respect the confessors, and he permitted other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to visit them. Perpetua's father was also admitted and made another fruitless attempt to pervert her.

<p>Secundulus, one of the confessors, died in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. Felicitas, who at the time of her incarceration was with child (in the eighth month), was apprehensive that she would not be permitted to suffer <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at the same time as the others, since the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> forbade the execution of pregnant <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Happily, two days before the games she gave birth to a daughter, who was adopted by a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. On 7 March, the five confessors were led into the amphitheatre. At the demand of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> mob they were first scourged; then a boar, a bear, and a leopard, were set at the men, and a wild cow at the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Wounded by the wild animals, they gave each other the <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a> and were then put to the sword. Their bodies were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> at Carthage. Their <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a> was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> commemorated even outside Africa. Thus under 7 March the names of Felicitas and Perpetua are entered in the Philocalian calendar, i.e. the calendar of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> publicly in the fourth century at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. A magnificent basilica was afterwards erected over their <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, the Basilica Majorum; that the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> was indeed in this basilica has lately been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by Pere Delattre, who discovered there an ancient inscription bearing the names of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of these <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is still celebrated on 7 March. The Latin description of their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> was discovered by <a href="../cathen/07397a.htm">Holstenius</a> and published by Poussines. Chapters iii-x contain the narrative and the visions of Perpetua; chapters xi-ciii the vision of Saturus; chapters i, ii and xiv-xxi were written by an eyewitness soon after the death of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. In 1890 Rendel Harris discovered a similar narrative written in Greek, which he published in collaboration with Seth K. Gifford (London, 1890). Several historians maintain that this Greek text is the original, others that both the Greek and the Latin texts are contemporary; but there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the Latin text is the original and that the Greek is merely a translation. That <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> is the author of these Acts is an unproved assertion. The statement that these <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were all or in part <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a> also lacks <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>; at least there is no intimations of it in the Acts.
