<h1>Sts. Fergus</h1>  

<h2>St. Fergus Cruithneach</h2>

<p>Died about 730, known in the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> as St. Fergus Cruithneach, or the Pict. The <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> of Aberdeen states that he had been a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for many years in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> when he came on a mission to Alba with some chosen <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. He settled first near Strageath, in the present <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Upper Strathearn, in Upper Perth, erected three churches in that district. The churches of Strageath, Blackford, and Dolpatrick are found there today <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>. He next evangelized Caithness and established there the churches of Wick and Halkirk. Thence he crossed to Buchan in Aberdeenshire and founded a church at Lungley, a village now called St. Fergus. Lastly, he established a church at Glammis in Forfarshire. He went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 721 and was present with <a href="../cathen/13680a.htm">Sedulius</a> and twenty other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">basilica of St. Peter</a>, convened by <a href="../cathen/06787a.htm">Gregory II</a>. His remains were deposited in the church of Glammis and were the object of much <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">veneration</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Scone transferred his head to Scone church, and encased it in a costly shrine there is an entry in the accounts of the treasurer of James IV, October, 1503, "An offerand of 13 shillings to Sanct Fergus' heide in Scone". The churches of Wick, Glammis, and Lungley had St. Fergus as their <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">festival</a> is recorded in the Martyrology of Tallaght for the 8th of September but seems to have been observed in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> on the 18th of November.
<h2>St. Fergus, bishop of Duleek</h2>

<p>Died 778, mentioned by Duald MacFirbis, Annals of the Four Masters, Annals of Ulster.
<h2>St. Fergus, bishop of Downpatrick</h2>

<p>Died 583. He was sixth in descent from Coelbad, King of Erin. He built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> called Killmbain, identified by some as Killyban, Co. Down, and afterwards was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and ruled the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> of Druimleithglais (Down). He was probably the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on the 30th of March.

<p>Ten <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of this name are mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> of Donegal.
