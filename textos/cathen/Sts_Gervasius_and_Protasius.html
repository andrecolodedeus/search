<h1>Sts. Gervasius and Protasius</h1>  

<p>Martyrs of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, probably in the second century, patrons of the city of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and of haymakers; invoked for the discovery of thieves. Feast, in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, 19 June, the day of the translation of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>; in the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, 14 Oct., the supposed day of their death. Emblems: scourge, club, sword.

<p>The Acts (Acta SS., June, IV, 680 and 29) were perhaps compiled from a letter (Ep. liii) to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, falsely ascribed to <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>. They are written in a very simple style, but it has been found impossible to establish their age. According to these, Gervasius and Protasius were twins, children of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Their father <a href="../cathen/15486a.htm">Vitalis</a>, a man of consular dignity, suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> under <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>(?). The mother Valeria died for her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. The sons are said to have been scourged and then beheaded, during the reign of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, under the presidency of Anubinus or Astasius, and while Cajus was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. Some authors place the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, while others object to this time, because they fail to understand how, in that case, the place of burial, and even the names, could be forgotten by the time of St. Ambrose, as is stated. <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> places their death before <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>. It probably occurred during the reign of <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Antoninus</a> (161-168).

<p>St. Ambrose, in 386, had built a magnificent basilica at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. Asked by the people to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> it in the same solemn manner as was done in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he promised to do so if he could obtain the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. In a dream he was shown the place in which such could be found. He ordered excavations to be made in the cemetery church of <a href="../cathen/10666b.htm">Sts. Nabor and Felix</a>, outside the city, and there found the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of Sts. Gervasius and Protasius. He had them removed to the church of St. Fausta, and on the next day into the basilica, which later received the name San Ambrogio Maggiore. Many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are related to have occurred, and all greatly rejoiced at the signal favour from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, given at the time of the great struggle between St. Ambrose and the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> Empress Justina. Of the vision, the subsequent discovery of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> and the accompanying <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, St. Ambrose wrote to his sister Marcellina. St. Augustine, not yet <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, witnessed the facts, and relates them in his "Confessions", IX, vii; in <a href="../fathers/120122.htm"><em>City of God</em> XXII.8</a>; and in "Serm. 286 in natal. Ss. Mm. Gerv. et Prot.", they are also attested by <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">St. Paulinus of Nola</a>, in his life of St. Ambrose. The latter died 397 and, as he had wished, his body was, on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a>, deposited in his basilica by the side of these <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. In 835, Angilbert II, a successor in the See of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, placed the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the three <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in a porphyry sarcophagus, and here they were again found, January, 1864 (Civilt&agrave; Cattolica, 1864, IX, 608, and XII, 345).

<p>A tradition claims that after the destruction of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> by <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a>, his chancellor Rainald von Dassel had taken the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> from <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and deposited them at Altbreisach in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, whence some came to <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>; the claim is rejected by <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (Biraghi, "I tre sepoleri", etc. <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 1864). Immediately after the finding of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> by St. Ambrose, the cult of Sts. Gervasius and Protasius was spread in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and churches were built in their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> at <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, <a href="../cathen/11089b.htm">Nola</a>, etc. In Gaul we find churches dedicated to them, about 400, at <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Mans</a>, <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>. At the Louvre there is now a famous picture of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> by Lesueur (d. 1655), which was formerly in their church at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. According to the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a> (402-417) dedicated a church to them at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Later, the name of <a href="../cathen/15486a.htm">St. Vitalis</a>, their father, was added to the title. Very early their names were inserted in the <a href="../cathen/09291a.htm">Litany of the Saints</a>. The whole history of these <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> has received a great deal of adverse criticism. Some deny their existence, and make them a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianized</a> version of the Dioscuri of the Romans. Thus Harris, "The Dioscuri in Christian Legend", but see "Analecta Boll." (1904), XXIII, 427.
