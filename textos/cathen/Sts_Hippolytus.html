<h1>Sts. Hippolytus</h1>  

<p>Besides the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">St. Hippolytus of Rome</a>, others of the name are mentioned in the old <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> and legends of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> as having shed their blood for the Faith. Some of these, however, are to be identified with him. In the Acts of St. Laurence we find an officer Hippolytus who, with his nurse Concordia and nineteen others of his household, was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> for the Faith. The same statement also appears in the Roman Martyrology under the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of 13 August. But this Hippolytus is without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> identical with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> who has been connected by legend with St. Laurence, whose grave is situated near the cemetery of Hippolytus.

<p>Hippolytus was also commemorated at a later date in common with St. Cassian, with whom he had no connection whatsoever. According to the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> of Prudentius on Cassian (Peristephanon, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> IX), the latter was a teacher at <a href="../cathen/07692a.htm">Imola</a> (Forum Cornelii) and was surrendered to the fury of his pupils, who tortured him to death with their iron styles. He is without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> an historical <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, who probably suffered in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>.

<p>Another Hippolytus is likewise found among a group of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> described as "Greek martyrs" (martyres groeci), whose burial place was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of Callistus. This Hippolytus is certainly distinct from the Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> (<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, "Roma sotterranea", III, 201-208). The <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of these <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is celebrated on 2 December.

<p>Furthermore the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Hippolytus of Porto is commemorated on 22 August in the Roman Martyrology. This statement, which occurs even in ancient <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a>, is connected with the confusion regarding the Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, resulting from the Acts of the Martyrs of Porto. It has not been ascertained whether the memory of the latter was localized at Porto merely in connection with the legend in Prudentius, without further foundation, or whether a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> named Hippolytus was really <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at Porto, and afterwards confounded in legend with <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus of Rome</a>.
