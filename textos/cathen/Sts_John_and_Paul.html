<h1>Sts. John and Paul</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyred</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 26 June. The year of their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is uncertain according to their Acts, it occurred under <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a> (361-3). In the second half of the fourth century, Byzantius, the Roman senator, and Pammachius, his son, fashioned their house on the C&aelig;lian Hill into a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> basilica. In the fifth century the <em>presbyteri tituli Byzantii</em> (priests of the church of Byzantius) are mentioned in an inscription and among the signatures of the Roman Council of 499. The church was also called the <em>titulus Pammachii</em> after Byzantius's son, the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> friend of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>. In the ancient apartments on the ground-floor of the house of Byzantius, which were still retained under the basilica, the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of two Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, John and Paul, was the object of veneration as early as the fifth century. The <em>Sacramentarium Leonianum</em> already indicates in the preface to the feast of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, that they rested within the city walls ("Sacr. Leon.", ed. Feltoe, Cambridge, 1896, 34), while, in one of the early itineraries to the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, their grave is assigned to the church on the C&aelig;lian (De rossi, "Roma sotterrania", I, 138, 175). The <em>titulus Byzantii</em> or <em>Pammachii</em> was consequently known at a very early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> by the names of the two <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> (<em>titulus SS. Joannis et Pauli</em>). That the two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, is historically certain; as to how and when their bodies found a resting-place in the house of Pammachius under the basilica, we only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it certainly occurred in the fourth century. The year and circumstances of their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> are likewise unknown. According to their Acts, which are of a purely legendary character and without historical foundation, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were eunuchs of Constantina, daughter of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>, and became acquainted with a certain Gallicanus, who built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> in <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>. At the command of <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a>, they were beheaded secretly by Terentianus in their house on the C&aelig;lian, where their church was subsequently erected, and where they themselves were buried. The rooms on the ground-floor of the above-mentioned house of Pammachius were rediscovered under the Basilica of SS. Giovanni e Paolo in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. They are decorated with important and interesting frescoes, while the original <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> (<em>confessio</em>) of Sts. John and Paul is covered with <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of which the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> are the subject. The rooms and the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> form one of the most important early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> memorials in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Since the erection of the basilica, the two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have been greatly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>, and their names have been inserted in the Canon of the Mass. Their <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 26 June.
