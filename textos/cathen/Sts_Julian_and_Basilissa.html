<h1>Sts. Julian and Basilissa</h1>  

<p>Husband and wife; died at Antioch or, more probably, at <a href="../cathen/01564a.htm">Antinoe</a>, in the reign of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, early in the fourth century, on 9 January, according to the Roman Martyrology, or 8 January, according to the Greek Menaea. We have no historically certain data relating to these two holy personages, and more than one this Julian of <a href="../cathen/01564a.htm">Antinoe</a> has been confounded with Julian of Cilicia. The confusion is easily explained by the fact that thirty-nine <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of this name are mentioned in the Roman Martyrology, eight of whom are commemorated in the one month of January. But little is known of this <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, one we put aside the exaggerations of his Acts. Forced by his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marry</a>, he agreed with his spouse, Basilissa, that they should both preserve their virginity, and further encouraged her to found a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, of which she became the superior. while he himself gathered a large number of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and undertook their direction. Basilissa died a very holy death, but <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> was reserved for Julian. During the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> he was arrested, tortured, and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, by the order of the governor, Martian, according to the Latins, at <a href="../cathen/01564a.htm">Antinoe</a>, in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, according to the Greeks, which seems more probable. Unfortunately, the Acts of this <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> belong to those <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> romances so much appreciated in early times, whose authors, unearned only for the edification of their readers, drowned the few known facts in a mass of imaginary details. Like many similar lives of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, it offers <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, prodigies, and improbable utterances, that lack the least historical value. In any ease these two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> must have enjoyed a great reputation in antiquity, and their veneration was well established before the eighth century. In the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum" they are mentioned under 6 January; Usuard, Ado, <a href="../cathen/11125b.htm">Notker</a>, and others place them under the ninth, and <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a> under the thirteenth of the same month, while Vandelbert puts them under 13 February, and the <a href="../cathen/10191b.htm">Menology</a> of Canisius under 21 June, the day to which the Greek Menaea assign St. Julian of Caesarea. There used to exist at Constantinople a church under the invocation of these <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, the dedication of which is inscribed in the Greek Calendar under 5 July.
