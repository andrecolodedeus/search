<h1>Sts. Mark and Marcellian</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyred</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> towards the end of the third century, most likely in 286. These <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, who were brothers, are mentioned in most of the ancient <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> on 18 June, and their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is known to us from the Acts of St. Sebastian, which, though in great part legendary, are nevertheless very ancient. Cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> for being <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, they were visited by their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father and mother</a>, Tranquillinus and Martia, who, being still <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolaters</a>, implored them to return to the worship of the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> gods to save their lives. But Sebastian, whose approaching <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> was to render him illustrious, having penetrated into their <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> at the same time, exhorted them so earnestly not to abandon the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>, that he not only rendered their fidelity immovable, but also converted their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and several of their friends who were present. The judge, before whom they were at length brought, not being able to induce them to <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a>, condemned them to death. They were buried in the Via Ardeatina, near the cemetery of <a href="../cathen/06098b.htm">Domitilla</a>. Their bodies were translated at a later date (which is not quite certain, but probably in the ninth century) to the church of Sts. Cosmas and Damian, where they were rediscovered in 1583 in the reign of <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>. They still rest there in a <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, near which may be seen an ancient <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> wherein the two <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> are represented with a third <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who seems be the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>.
