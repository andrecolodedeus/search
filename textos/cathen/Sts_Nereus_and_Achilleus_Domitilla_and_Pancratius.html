<h1>Sts. Nereus and Achilleus, Domitilla and Pancratius</h1>  

<p>The commemoration of these four Roman <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is made by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on 12 May, in common, and all four are named in the Proper of the Mass as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. The old Roman lists, of the fifth century, and which passed over into the Martyrologium Hiernoymianum, contain the names of the two <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> Nereus and Achilleus, whose grave was in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Domitilla on the Via Ardeatina; in the same calendar was found the name of St. Pancratius, whose body rested in a <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> on the Via Aurelia. The notice in the more complete version given by the Berne Codex, runs as follows: "IIII id. Maii, Romae in coemeterio Praetextati natale Nerei et Achillei fratrum, et natale sci. Pancrati via Aurelia miliario secundo" (On 12 May at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the cemetery of Praetextatus [an evident <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> for Domitilla] the natal day of Nereus and Achilleus, and the natal day of St. Pancratius, on the Aurelian Way at the second milestone"; ed. de Rossi-Duchesne, Acta SS., Nov., II, [59]). In the invocation of the Mass for their feast, in the "Sacramentarium Gelasianum", the names of Nereus and Achilleus alone are mentioned, and this is because only their invocation in the Mass was entered in the collection, the feast of St. Pancratius being celebrated in the church built over his grave on the Via Aurelia. In the Mass of his festival, the formula of which is unknown to us, his name, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, was alone mentioned. In the fourth and following centuries there was celebrated on 12 May in both places, at the grave of Saints Nereus and Achilleus on the Via Ardeatina, and at that of St. Pancratius on the Via Aurelia, a special votive Mass. The Itineraries of the graves of the Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, written in the seventh century, are unanimous in their indication of the resting-place of these <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> (de Rossi, "Roma sotterranea", I, 180-83). The church which was erected in the fourth century over the grave of St. Pancratius, stands today in somewhat altered style. The legend describing the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> is of later origin, and not reliable historically; it is probable that he was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/15256b.htm">Valerian</a> (257-58) or in that of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> (304-06).

<p>The church built over the grave of Sts. Nereus and Achilleus in the Via Ardeatina, is of the latter part of the fourth century; it is a three-naved basilica, and was discovered by de Rossi in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Domitilla. Amongst the numerous objects found in the ruins were two pillars which had supported the <em>giborium</em> ornamented with <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> representing the death of the two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> by decapitation; one of these pillars is perfectly preserved, and the name of Achilleus is carved on it. There was also found a large fragment of a marble slab, with an inscription composed by Pope Damasus, the text of which is well-known from an ancient copy. This oldest historical mention of the two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> (Weyman, "Vier Epigramme des h. Papstes Damasus", <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 1905; de Rossi, "Inscriptiones christianae", II, 31; Ihm, "Damasi epigrammata", Leipzig, 1895, 12, no. 8) tells how Nereus and Achilleus as soldiers were obedient to the tyrant, but suddenly being <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, joyfully resigned their commission, and did the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> death; as to the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of their glorious confession we can make no inference. The acts of these <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, legendary even to a romantic degree, have no historical value for their life and death; they bring no fewer than thirteen different Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> into relation, amongst them even <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> Petrine Acts, and place their death in the end of the first and beginning of the second centuries. These Acts were written in Greek and Latin; according to Achelis (see below) the Greek was the original text, and written in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the sixth century; Schaefer (see below) on the other hand holds the Latin to have been the older version, and seeks to prove that it emanated from the first half of the fifth century; so remote a date is improbable, and the sixth century is to be preferred as the source of the Acts. According to these legends Nereus and Achilleus were eunuchs and chamberlains of <a href="../cathen/06098b.htm">Flavia Domitilla</a>, a niece of the <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Emperor Domitian</a>; with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> virgin they had been banished to the island of Pontia, and later on beheaded in <a href="../cathen/14518c.htm">Terracina</a>. The graves of these two <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were on an estate of the <a href="../cathen/06098b.htm">Lady Domitilla</a> near the Via Ardeatina, close to that of <a href="../cathen/11781b.htm">St. Petronilla</a>.

<p>The author of this legend places the two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> quite differently from Pope Damasus, in his poem: as Nereus and Achilleus were buried in a very ancient part of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of Domitilla, built as far back as the beginning of the second century, we may conclude that they are among the most ancient <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, and stand in very near relation to the Flavian <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/06098b.htm">Domitilla</a>, the foundress of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a>, was a member. In the Epistle to the Romans, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> mentions a Nereus with his sister, to whom he sends greetings (<a href="../bible/rom016.htm#vrs15">Romans 16:15</a>), perhaps even the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> was a descendant of this disciple of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle of the Gentiles</a>. Owing to the purely legendary character of these Acts, we cannot use them as an argument to aid in the controversy as to whether there were two <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the name of <a href="../cathen/06098b.htm">Domitilla</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Flavian, or only one, the wife of the Consul Flavius Clemens (see <a href="../cathen/06098b.htm">FLAVIA DOMITILLA</a>). As to other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of the name Nereus, who are especially noted in the old <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, or as being natives of that country (e.g., in the Martyrologium Hieronymianum, 11 May, 15 or 16 October, 16 Nov.) though there is one of the name in the present Roman Martyrology under <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of 16 Oct., nothing more is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.
