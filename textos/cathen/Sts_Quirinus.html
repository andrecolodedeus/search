<h1>Sts. Quirinus</h1>  

<p>Several <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of this name are mentioned in the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum" and in the historical Martyrologies of the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and the feasts of these <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are still to be found in the catalogue of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>.

<p>(1) According to the legendary <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts of the martyrs</a> St. Maris and St. Martha, a Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Quirinus (Cyrinus) was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of  Pontian. However, the Itineraries to the graves of the Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> do not mention him. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 25 March. Perhaps this Quirinus is meant by the expression "Rom&aelig; sancti Cyri" found in the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum" of 24 March (cf. "Acta SS.", III, March, 543 sqq.; Dufourcq Les Gesta martyrum romains", I, 240). In the eighth century the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> were translated to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> abbey of Tegernsee in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>.

<p>(2) Another Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> named Quirinus was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Pr&aelig;textatus on the Via Appia. Both the name and the place of burial are mentioned in the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum" (ed. De Rossi-Duchesne, 52), as also in the Itineraries to the graves of the Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> (<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, "Roma sotterranea", I, 180-1). His name undoubtedly appeared in the catalogue of Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of the fourth century under <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of 30 April, which is the day that the Martyrology of Jerome assigns him. He is introduced into the legendary Acts of Sts. Alexander and Balbina, where it is said he was a tribune (Dufourcq, loc. cit., 175). Ado took the name from these Acts and put it in his Martyrology under <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of 30 March, on which day it is now also found in the Roman Martyrology (Quentin, "Les martyrologes historiques", 490). In 1050 the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of Quirinus were given by <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> to his sister Gepa, <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Neuss. In this way the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> came to the beautiful Romanesque Church of St. Quirinus at Neuss which still exists.

<p>(3) The <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of a third St. Quirinus, now in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, were brought thither from Pannonia. This St. Quirinus was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Siscia, now Sissek in <a href="../cathen/04510a.htm">Croatia</a>, and suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in 309. He was thrown into the water with a millstone about his neck and drowned. The genuine Acts of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> are still in existence (Ruinart, "Acta mart.", <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, 522), also a <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> by Prudentius (loc. cit., 524). Upon the incursion of the barbarians into Pannonia at the beginning of the fifth century the inhabitants fled to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and took the bones of St. Quirinus with them. The remains were taken to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in a vaulted chamber near the Church of St. Sebastian on the Via Appia (De Waal, "Die Apostelgruft ad Catacumbas an der via Appia", Rome, 1894). His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is observed on 4 June.

<p>(4) The name of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Quirinus, who is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tivoli</a>, is found in the present Roman Martyrology under the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of 4 June. There is no historical account of him; he is, perhaps, identical with one of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of this name who are mentioned in the Martyrology of Jerome among groups of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> under the dates of 12 March, 3 and 4 June. Under 4 June a Quirinus is mentioned with a statement of the place "Nividuno civitate" (Mart. Hieron., 31, 73, 75).

<p>(5) At Malmedy, in <a href="../cathen/11415b.htm">Rhenish Prussia</a>, is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> a St. Quirinus. It is related that at the beginning of the ninth century his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were translated to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church there. According to the legend he was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, together with a companion Nicasius, in the <em>pagus Vulcassinus</em> (Vexin). No trustworthy historical reports of him exist. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is observed on 11 October.
