<h1>Sts. Romanus</h1>  

<p>(1) A Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Romanus is mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> (ed. Duchesne, I, 155) with three other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> as companions in the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> (10 August, 258). There is no reason to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that this mention rests upon a genuine ancient tradition. Like <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> Romanus was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of the Cyriaca on the Via Tiburtina. The grave of St.Romanus is explicitly mentioned in the Itineraries of the seventh century (<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, "Roma sotterranea", I, 178-9). In the purely legendary Acts of <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>, the ostiary Romanus is transformed into a soldier, and an account in accordance with this statement was inserted in the historical <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> and in the present Roman Martyrology, which latter places his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> on 9 August (cf. Duchfourcq, Les Gesta Martyrum romains", I, 201).

<p>(2) In 303 or 304, at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> called Romanus of Caesarea in Palestine suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at Antioch. Upon the proclamation of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian's</a> edict he strengthened the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">Christians of Antioch</a> and openly exhorted the weaker brethren, who were willing to offer <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, not to waver in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. He was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, was condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> by fire, and was bound to the stake; however, as the Emperor Galerius was then in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, Romanus was brought before him. At the emperor's command the tongue of the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a> confessor was cut out. Tortured in various ways in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> he was finally strangled. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> speaks of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in "De martyribus Palestin.", c. ii. Prudentius ("Peristephanon", X in "P.L.", LX, 444 sqq.) relates other details and gives Romanus a companion in <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> by name Barulas. On this account several historians, among them <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, consider that there were two <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> named Romanus at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, though more likely there was but the one whom <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> mentions. Prudentius has introduced legendary features into his account, and his connection of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of Barulas with that of Romanus is probably arbitrary. The feast of St.Romanus is observed on 18 November [cf. Allard, "Histoire des pers&eacute;cutions", IV, 173 sq.; Quentin, "Les martyrologes historiques" (Paris, 1908), 183-5].

<p>(3) The "Martyrologium Hieronymianum" mentions <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of this name at several dates, chiefly in large companies of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. No further particulars are known of any of them.

<p>(4) A <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> named Romanus laboured in the district of Blaye, in the present French department of the Gironde, at the end of the fourth century. <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> gives an account of him ("De gloria confessorum", c. xlv), and relates that <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a> made ready the grave of the dead Romanus. An old life of St.Romanus was published in the "Analecta Bollandiana", V (1866), 178 sqq. The <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> is observed on 24 November.

<p>(5) St.Romanus, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Condat, now St. Claude in the French Jura, b. about 400; d. in 463 or 464. When thirty-five years old he went into the lonely region of Condat to live as a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>, where after a while his younger brother Lupicinus followed him. A large number of scholars, among whom was <a href="../cathen/05597c.htm">St. Eugendus</a>, placed themselves under the direction of the two holy brothers who founded several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>: Condat (now Saint-Claude), Lauconne (later Saint-Lupicin, as Lupicinus was buried there), La Balme (later Saint-Romain-de-Roche), where St.Romanus was buried, and Romainm&ocirc;tier (<em>Romanum monasterium</em>) in the canton of Vaud in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. Romanus was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by <a href="../cathen/07349a.htm">St. Hilary of Arles</a> in 444, and with Lupicinus he directed these <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> until his death. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is observed on 28 February. Two lives of him are in existence: one by <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> in the "Liber vitae patrum" (Mon. Germ. Hist.: Script. Merov., I, 663), and an anonymous "Vita Sanctorum Romani, Lupicini, Eugendi" [ibid., III, 131 sqq.; cf. Beno&icirc;t, "Histoire de St-Claude", I (Paris, 1890); Besson, "Recherches sur les origines des &eacute;v&ecirc;ch&eacute;s de Gen&egrave;ve, Lausanne, et Sion" (Fribourg, 1906), 210 sqq.].

<p>(6) St.Romanus, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> near <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, at the beginning of the sixth century. He aided St. Benedict when the latter withdrew into a solitary place and regularly brought Benedict bread to support life (<a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, "Dialogi", II, i). Romanus later (fom 523) represented St. Benedict at <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a>, and is said to have afterwards gone to Gaul and to have founded a small <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Dryes-Fontrouge, where he died about 550 and was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a saint. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is observed on 22 May. A St.Romanus, who is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Auxerre on 8 October, is probably identical with this Abbot Romanus whose <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were subsequently translated to Auxerre [cf. "Acta SS.", May, V, 153 sqq.; October, III, 396 sqq.; Adlhoch in "Studien und Mitteilungen aus dem Benedictiner- und Cisterzienerorden" (1907), 267 sqq., 501 sqq.; (1908), 103 sqq., 327 sqq., 587 sqq.; Leclerc, "Vie de St Romain, &eacute;ducateur de St B&eacute;noit" (Paris, 1893)].

<p>(7) St.Romanus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; d. about 640. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is observed on 23 October. The legend of this saint has little historical value (Acta SS., October, X, 91 sqq.), and there is but little authentic information concerning him [cf. "Analecta Bollandiana" (1904), 337 sq.].

<p>(8) St.Romanus, "the Singer", the most important representative of rhythmic poetry in the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>. According to the Greek "Menaia" he was born in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> at Berytus, then went to Constantinople, where he became one of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> at the Blachernen church. The era in which he lived is not certainly ascertained; most probably, however, his residence in Constantinople was from about 515 to 556. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is observed on 1 October. Several of his poems were edited by Pitra, "Analecta sacra", I (Paris, 1876), 1-241 [cf. Maas, "Die Chronologie der Hymnen des Romanus" in "Byzantin. Zeitschrift" (1906), 1-44; Bardenhewer, "Patrologie" (3rd ed.), 486].

<p>[<em>Note:</em> St.Romanus the Singer, described above (8), is identical with <a href="../cathen/13154a.htm">St. Romanos the Melodist</a>, <em>Romanus</em> and <em>Romanos</em> being the Latin and Greek forms respectively of the same name.]
