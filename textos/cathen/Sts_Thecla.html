<h1>Sts. Thecla</h1>  

<p>I. Thecla of Iconium</p>

<p>The reputed pupil of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, who is the heroine of the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> "Acta Pauli et Theclae" (cf. <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">APOCRYPHA</a>). Our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of her is derived exclusively from these Acts, which appeared about 180. According to this narrative Thecla was a virgin of <a href="../cathen/07619a.htm">Iconium</a> who was converted to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and led to dedicate herself to perpetual virginity by the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>. <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">Miraculously</a> saved from death at the stake to which she had been condemned, she went with St. Paul to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm#II">Antioch in Pisidia</a> where she was thrown to the wild beasts and was again saved from death by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. After this she went to Myra where the Apostle was, and finally to Seleucia where she died. With the consent of St. Paul she had acted as a "female Apostle" in proclaiming the Gospel. Notwithstanding the purely legendary character of the entire story, it is not impossible that it is connected with an historical <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. It is easy to believe that a virgin of this name who was a native of <a href="../cathen/07619a.htm">Iconium</a> was actually converted by St. Paul and then, like many other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of the Apostolic and later times, laboured in the work of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missions (cf. Harnack, "Die Mission und die Ausbreitung des Christentums in den ersten drei Jahrhunderten", 2nd ed., I, 295; II, 58). In the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> the wide circulation of the Acts led to a great veneration of Thecla. She was called "Apostle and protomartyr among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>". Her veneration was especially great in a number of Oriental cities, as Seleucia where she was buried, <a href="../cathen/07619a.htm">Iconium</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>. Her cult appeared very early also in Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, particularly in those districts where the Gallican Liturgy prevailed; there is direct <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this in the fourth century. Her name is given with various topographical comments (Nicomedia, <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>) on several days in the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum". Thus Thecla is mentioned in this <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> on 22 February, 25 February, 12 September, 23 September, and 17 November ("Mart. Hieron.". ed. de Rossi-Duchesne, 24, 36, 120, 124, 144). It seems certain that on all these dates, and probably also on 20 and 21 December, the same <a href="../cathen/14563a.htm">St. Thecla</a>, the pupil of St. Paul, is meant. In <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede's</a> Martyrology (cf. Quentin, "Martyrologes historiques du moyen &acirc;ge", 93) her name is mentioned with a brief notice taken from the Acts on 23 September, the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> as that on which her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is given in the present Roman Martyrology. The <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> celebrates her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> on 24 September and gives her the title of "Protomartyr among women and equal to the Apostles" (cf. <a href="../cathen/11078a.htm">Nilles</a>, "Calendarium utriusque ecclesiae", I, 283 sq.). See bibliography of <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">APOCRYPHA</a>; HOLZHEY, <em>Die Thecla-Akten, ihre Verbreitung u. Beurteilung in der Kirche</em> (Munich, 1905).

<p>II. We possess historically accurate accounts of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> of <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a> in Palestine named Thecla. According to <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> ("De martyribus Palestinen.", 3) she was condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> in the second year of the great <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> (304-05) together with a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> named Agapius and was torn to pieces in a horrible manner by the wild beasts to which she was thrown. The present Roman Martyrology gives the feast of this saint under the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of 19 August.

<p>III. The "Martyrologium Hieronymianum mentions a Thecla in connection with a Zosimus among the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> whose feast was celebrated on 1 June; these two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were commemorated at Antioch. Whether this Thecla was a local saint of the Oriental <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> is not known.

<p>IV. A <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/14563a.htm">St. Thecla</a> on the Via Ostiensis, not far from the <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">burial place of St. Paul</a>, is mentioned in the seventh-century itineraries to the graves of the Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. A church stood on this spot on a hill over the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> where the body of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> rested. <a href="../cathen/14563a.htm">St. Thecla</a> must be regarded as a Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. Armellini believes that he has found the cemetery of <a href="../cathen/14563a.htm">St. Thecla</a> (cf. Marucchi, Les catacombes romaines", Rome, 1903, p. 91 sqq.).

<p>V. The Martyrology of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> mentions under 31 May (69), in connection with two <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> buried on the Via Aurelia, a group of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> named Tertulla, Lupus, Justa, and Thecla. It is very possible that besides the <a href="../cathen/14563a.htm">St. Thecla</a> buried on the Via Ostiensis another Roman <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> bearing the same name was buried on the Via Aurelia. Still we have no further account of this group of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and just as little of a number of Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, among whom the name of a Thecla also occurs, that are given under 26 March in the present Roman Martyrology.

<p>VI. In the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum" (58, 78) a long list of the names of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">African</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> is given under the dates of 10 May, 13 and 14 June, and each time a Thecla is mentioned. Nothing further is known of this saint. In the legend of the twelve brothers and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, Donatus, etc. (cf. Acta SS., Sept., I, 138-41), the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of the brothers are called Boniface and Thecla, and these two are also given in the present Roman Martyrology as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> under 30 August. Apart from the purely legendary Acts just mentioned nothing is known of them. VII. In the "Acts of St. Hermagoras", which are equally legendary (<a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, "Martyr. Romanum cum notis Baronii", <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1609, p. 494) a <a href="../cathen/14563a.htm">St. Thecla</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> is mentioned together with several other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who are only known through this legend. Their <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is observed on 3 September.
