<h1>Sts. Vitus, Modestus, and Crescentia</h1>  

<p>According to the legend, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>; feast, 15 June. The earliest testimony for their veneration is offered by the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum" (ed. De Rossi-Duchesne, 78: "In Sicilia, Viti, Modesti et Crescentiae"). The fact that the note is in the three most important <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> proves that it was also in the common exemplar of these, which appeared in the fifth century. The same Martyrologium has under the same day another Vitus at the head of a list of nine <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, with the statement of the place, "In Lucania", that is, in the Roman province of that name in Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> between the <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscan</a> Sea and the Gulf of <a href="../cathen/14450d.htm">Taranto</a>. It is easily possible that the same <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Vitus in both cases, because only the name of a territory is given, not of a city, as the place where the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>. This testimony to the public veneration of the three <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in the fifth century proves positively that they are historical <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. There are, nevertheless, no historical accounts of them, nor of the time or the details of their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. During the sixth and seventh centuries a purely legendary narrative of their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> appeared which was based upon other legends, especially on the legend of Poitus, and ornamented with accounts of fantastic <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. It still exists in various versions, but has no historical value.

<p>According to this legend Vitus was a boy seven years of age (other versions make him twelve years old), the son of a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> senator of Lucania. During the era of the Emperors <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> and Maximilian, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> sought in every way, including various forms of torture, to make him <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a>. But he remained steadfast, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> aided him in a wonderful manner. He fled with his tutor Modestus in a boat to Lucania. From Lucania he was taken to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to drive out a demon which had taken possession of a son of the <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Emperor Diocletian</a>. This he did, and yet, because he remained steadfast in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>, he was tortured together with his tutor Modestus and his nurse Crescentia. By a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> brought back the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> to Lucania, where they died from the tortures they had endured. Three days later Vitus appeared to a distinguished matron named Florentia, who then found the bodies and buried them in the spot where they were. It is evident that the author of the legend has connected in his invention three <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who apparently suffered death in Lucania, and were first <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> there. The veneration of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> spread rapidly in Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, as is shown by the note in the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum". <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope Gregory the Great</a> mentions a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> dedicated to Vitus in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> ("Epist.", I, xlviii, P.L., LXXXVII, 511). The veneration of Vitus, the chief saint of the group, also appeared very early at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Pope Gelasius (492-496) mentions a shrine dedicated to him (Jaff&eacute;, "Reg. Rom. Pont.", 2nd ed., I, 6 79), and at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the seventh century the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deaconry</a> was dedicated to him ("Liber Pont.", ed. Duchesne, I, 470 sq.). In the eighth century it is said that <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Vitus were brought to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St-Denis by Abbot Fulrad. They were later presented to Abbot Warin of Corvey in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, who solemnly transferred them to this <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in 836. From Corvey the veneration of St. Vitus spread throughout <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> and in the districts of eastern and northern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. St. Vitus is appealed to, above all, against epilepsy, which is called St. Vitus's Dance, and he is one of the Fourteen Martyrs who give aid in times of trouble. He is represented near a kettle of boiling oil, because according to the legend he was thrown into such a kettle, but escaped <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the three <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> was adopted in the historical Martyrologies of the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> and is also recorded in the present Roman Martyrology on 15 June.
