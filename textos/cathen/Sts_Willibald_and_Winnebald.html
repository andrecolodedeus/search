<h1>Sts. Willibald and Winnebald</h1>  

<p>(WUNIBALD, WYNNEBALD).

<p>Members of the Order of St. Benedict, brothers, natives probably of Wessex in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, the former, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;tt</a>, born on 21 October, 700 (701); died on 7 July, 781 (787); the latter, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Heidenheim, born in 702; died on 18 (19) December, 761. They were the children of St. Richard, commonly called the King; their mother was a relative of <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>. Willibald entered the <a href="../cathen/15545a.htm">Abbey of Waltham</a> in Hampshire at the age of five and was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by Egwald. He made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 722 with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> and brother. Richard died at <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a> and was buried in the Church of St. Frigidian. After an attack of malaria Willibald started from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 724 with two companions on a trip to the Holy Land, passed the winter at <a href="../cathen/11541a.htm">Patara</a>, and arrived at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> on 11 November, 725. He then went to <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, to Constantinople, and in 730 arrived at the Abbey of Monte Casino, after having visited the grave of St. Severin of Noricum in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. In 740 he was again at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whence he was sent by <a href="../cathen/06789a.htm">Gregory III</a> to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. There he was welcomed by <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, who <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> him on 22 July, 741, and assigned him to missionary work at <a href="../cathen/05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;tt</a>. Possibly the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of Willibald was connected with <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface's</a> missionary plans regarding the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>. On 21 October, 741 (742), <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at S&uuml;lzenbr&uuml;cken near Gotha. The <a href="../cathen/05364a.htm">Diocese of Eichst&auml;tt</a> was formed a few years later. Winnebald had, after the departure of his brother for Palestine, lived in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 730 he visited <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to procure candidates for the religious state and returned the same year. On his third visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> received a promise that Winnebald would go to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Winnebald arrived in Thuringia on 30 November, 740, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He took part in the Concilium Germanicum, 21 April, 744 (742), was present at the Synod of Liptine, 1 March, 745 (743), subscribed Pepin's donation to <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, 753; joined the League of Attigny in 762; and subscribed the last will of Remigius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>. With his brother he founded the <a href="../cathen/10452a.htm">double monastery</a> of Heidenheim in 752; Winnebald was placed as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> over the men, and his sister, <a href="../cathen/15526b.htm">St. Walburga</a>, governed the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> community. Winnebald's body was found incorrupt eighteen years after his death. His name is mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Martyrology. Willibald blessed the new church of Heidenheim in 778. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> occurs in the Roman Martyrology on 7 July, but in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> it is observed by concession of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> on 9 July. A costly <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> for his remains was completed in 1269.
