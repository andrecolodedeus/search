<h1>Studion</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>Studium</em>), the most important <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Constantinople, situated not far from the Propontis in the section of the city called Psamathia. It was founded in 462 or 463 by the consul Studios (Studius), a Roman who had settled in Constantinople, and was dedicated to <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>. Its <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> came from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/01105d.htm">Acoemetae</a>. At a later date the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and customs of Studion were taken as models by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Mount Athos</a> and of many other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>; even today they have influence. The Studites gave the first <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their devotion to the Faith and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> during the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Acacius (484-519); they also remained loyal during the storms of <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclastic dispute</a> in the eighth and ninth centuries. They were driven from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Studion and the city by <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> Copronymus; after his death (775), however, some of them returned. Abbot Sabbas <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> defended the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrines</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclasts</a> at the <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Seventh Ecumenical Council in Nicaea</a> (787). His successor was <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">St. Theodore of Studion</a> to whom the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> owes the most of its fame, and who especially fostered study. During <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">St. Theodore's</a> administration also the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were harassed and driven away several times, some of them being <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. Theodore's pupil Naucratius re-established discipline after the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclastic dispute</a> had come to an end. Abbot Nicholas (848-5 and 855-58) refused to recognize the Patriarch Photius and was on this account <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the Studion. He was succeeded by five <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> who recognized the patriarch. The brilliant period of the Studion came to an end at this time. In the middle of the eleventh century, during the administration of Abbot Simeon, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> named Nicetas Pectoratus (Stethatos) made a violent attack on the Latins in a book which he wrote on unleavened bread, the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, and the marriage of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. In 1054 he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to recant in the presence of the emperor and of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> and to throw his book into the fire, but he began the dispute again later. As regards the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in other directions it is especially celebrated for its famous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of calligraphy which was established by <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">St. Theodore</a>. In he eighth and eleventh centuries the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was the centre of Byzantine religious poetry; a number of the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> are still used in the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>. Besides <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">St. Theodore</a> and Nicetas, a number of other <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> writers are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. In 1204 the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a> and was not rebuilt until 1290; the greater part of it was again destroyed when the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> captured Constantinople (1453). The only part now in existence is the Church of St. John Baptist, probably the oldest remaining church in Constantinople, a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> which still preserves from the early period two stories of columns on the sides and a wooden ceiling, and which is now the mosque Imrachor-Dschamissi.
