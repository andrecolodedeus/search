<h1>Styria</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German</a> Steiermark)

<p>A duchy and Austrian crownland, divided by the River Mur into Upper and Lower Styria. The province is rich in minerals, as iron ore, brown coal, etc. Its area is 8980 sq. miles, and in 1910 it had 1,441,604 inhabitants. Of the population 68 per cent are Germans, and 32 per cent Slovenes. The Slovenes, who are a branch of the Slavonic race, live chiefly in the southern and southeastern portions of the province, in Lower Styria. Ninety-eight per cent of the population is <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>; one per cent <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>; the rest are <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or belong to the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>. The capital of the province is Graz (152,000 inhabitants); it is the residence of the governor and the seat of the administration of the province. In the Roman era Styria was a part of Noricum. During the great migrations various German tribes traversed the region, and about <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 600 the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> took possession of it. Styria came under the supremacy of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> as a part of Karantania (Carinthia). Large numbers of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, especially Bavarians, came into the country, settled in colonies in it, and made it <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. The work of conversion was carried on mainly from <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>; Bishop Virgilius of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> (745-84), an Irishman, was largely instrumental in converting the country to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and gained for himself the name of "Apostle of Karantania". The Patriarchs of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> also shared in the work. In 811 <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> made the Drave River the boundary of the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> and <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>. In the tenth century a part of Styria was separated from Carinthia under the name of the Carinthian Mark; it was also named the Windic March. The margraves ruling the mark took from the name of the fortified castle of Steier the title of Margraves of Steiermark, and the country received in German the name of Steiermark. During the reign of Margrave Ottokar II (1164-92) Styria was raised to a duchy by the <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Emperor Frederick Barbarossa</a> in 1180. With the death of Ottokar the first line of rulers of Styria became extinct; the region fell to the Babenberg <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> who then ruled in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. In a short time this <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> became extinct also, and Styria then passed under the control of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> (1254-60), and of King Ottokar of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>; finally in 1276 it came into the possession of the Habsburgs, whose <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> it still remains. During the years 1379-1439 and 1564-1619 it was ruled by princes of its own from a branch of the Habsburgs. At the time of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> invasions in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the land suffered severely. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> made incursions into Styria nearly twenty times; <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, cities, and villages were destroyed and plundered, while the population was either killed or carried away into slavery.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> made its way into the country about 1530. During 1564-90 the country was ruled by Duke Karl, whose wife was the Duchess Maria of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a> champion of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. He introduced the <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a> into the country on the basis of the Religious Peace of Augsburg of 1555. In 1573 he summoned the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and in 1586 he founded the <a href="../cathen/06733d.htm">University of Graz</a>. In 1598 his son and successor, Ferdinand, suppressed all <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and expelled the foreign teachers and preachers. The common people again accepted with but slight opposition the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> doctrines were maintained only in a few isolated mountain valleys, as in the valley of the Inn and the valley of the Mur. The nobility were not forced to return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; each could have <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> services in his own house. After Ferdinand had become Emperor of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (1619) and had defeated his <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> opponents in the battle of the White Mountain near Prague (1620), he forbade in 1625 all <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> church services. In 1628 he commanded the nobility also to return to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. A large number of noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, consequently, <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> from the country; but most of them either returned, or their descendants did so, becoming <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and recovering their possessions. In the second half of the seventeenth century the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> spirit broke out again, especially in the distant valleys in the mountains, owing to events in the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>. The agitators from the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> districts of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> were expelled, and the peasants who would not give up <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> were condemned to compulsory emigration to <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>. It should be remembered that the harsh <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> issued by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rulers of Stylria and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> were the application of the axiom then current in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> national law: <em>cujus regio ejus religio,</em> and that the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes suppressed and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> and its adherents much more severely in their territories. The Edict of Toleration issued by the <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a> in 1781 put an end to the religious contest of more than two hundred years. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> then received the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to found <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> communities and to exercise their religion there undisturbed. On account of the constitutions gained by the German people in 1848 all the provinces of the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian Empire</a> received complete liberty of religion and of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, parity of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to the public exercise of religion. As regards the present relation between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, conditions are the same as in the other sections of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>.

<p>Ecclesiastically the province is divided into two prince-bishorics, <a href="../cathen/13672a.htm">Seckau</a> and <a href="../cathen/09049a.htm">Lavant</a>. Ever since the time of their foundation both have been suffragans of the <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Archdiocese of Salzburg</a>. The Prince-Bishopric of Sekau was established in 1218; since 1786 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of the prince-bishop has been Graz. The Prince-Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/09049a.htm">Lavant</a> was founded as a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in 1228, and raised to a prince-bishopric in 1446; since 1847 Marburg on the Drave has been the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of the prince-bishop. There are in the entire Duchy of Styria 96 deaneries and 551 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, altogether 1163 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> districts, each district containing on an average 1151 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Styria contains many old and celebrated houses of the orders, as: the collegiate foundation of the Reformed <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a> of Vorau (founded 1163); the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> at <a href="../cathen/01145a.htm">Admont</a> (1074); at St. Lambrecht (1066); at <a href="../cathen/13672a.htm">Seckau</a> (founded as a house of the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a> in 1140, suppressed in 1782, from 1883 a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, since 1887 abbey of the Beuronese <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>); the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at Rein (1120); the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/06733d.htm">Graz</a> (since 1515; founded in 1230 as a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a>), at Maria-Lankowitz (1467), at Maria-Nazareth (1632); the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorite</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at <a href="../cathen/06733d.htm">Graz</a> (1526), and of St. Peter and Paul at Pettau (1239); the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at Cilli (1611), Leibnitz (1634), Hartberg (1654), and Schwanberg (1706); the collegiate foundations of the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> at Mautern (dating from 1826; founded in 1670 as a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>), and at Leoben (1844); the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappist</a> Abbey of Maria-Erl&ouml;sung at Reichenberg (1881; <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> since 1891), etc. There are also many houses of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> orders and congregations. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> and confraternities are large and numerous.
