<h1>Subdeacon</h1>  

<p>The subdiaconate is the lowest of the sacred or major orders in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>. It is defined as the power by which one <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> as a subdeacon may carry the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> with wine to the altar, prepare the necessaries for the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, and read the Epistles before the people (Ferraris, op. cit., <em> infra</em> No. 40). According to the common opinion of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> at present, the subdeaconship was not instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Nor are there sufficient grounds for maintaining that it had an Apostolic origin. There is no mention of the subdiaconate in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> or in the authentic writings of the <a href="../cathen/01637a.htm">Apostolic Fathers</a>. These authorities make reference only to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>. At the Council of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> (A.D. 1091), <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> says: "We call <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacred orders</a> the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deaconship</a> and <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, for we read that the primitive Church had only those orders" (Can. I). Gratian (Dist. 21) says: "In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself instituted subdeacons and <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a>". It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIII, cap. 17, de ref.) says that "The functions of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deaconship</a> to the ostiariate were laudably sanctioned in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from the times of the Apostles"; but these words simply indicate that the "functions" were so exercised (that is as part of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a>); it was only in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> that they were separated from the office of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and committed to inferior <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>. This explains why some <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> (e.g. <a href="../cathen/14697c.htm">Thomassinus</a>, p. I, lib. II, cap. xl) speak of the subdeaconate as of Divine institution, that is they look on it as made up of functions proper to <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>. Gasparri (op. cit. <em>infra</em>, I, No. 35) says: "The Church, in the institution [of the subdeaconship] proceeded thus. She wished to commit to others the inferior functions of the order of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a>, both because the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, with the increase of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, could not suffice for their many and grave <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, and because she wished that others, received among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and marked with the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">clerical tonsure</a>, should ascend through <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, only after trial, to major orders. Imitating the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine Law</a> of the first three grades (<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>), she decreed that the power of performing these functions should be conferred by external rites similar to those by which major orders were bestowed."

<p>The subdiaconate is most probably, some say certainly not a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrament, but a <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramental</a> instituted by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. If it cannot be repeated, this is because the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has so wished, for she could institute a sacramental similar to a sacrament externally without thereby <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliging</a> us to hold that it imprints an indelible character on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the recipient. Wernz (op. cit. <em>infra</em>, No. 158) says: "Since ordinations below the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deaconship</a> are most probably not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, but rather <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a> they do not imprint the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">sacramental character</a>, hence if they are conferred validly, they give a power of order instituted solely by human law and circumscribed by its limits."

<p>Historically, the earliest mention of the subdiaconate seems to be found in the letter of <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Pope Cornelius</a> (A.D. 255) to Fabius of Antioch, in which he states that, there are among the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> forty-six <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, seven <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and seven subdeacons. There is nothing to indicate, however, that the subdiaconate is not older than the third century. That there were subdeacons in the African Church in the same century is evident from the letters of <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> (e.g. Epistle 8). The fourth <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> also mentions them in 398. The Synod of Elvira, (305) in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> does the same (c. 30). Their existence in the Oriental Church is testified to by <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> in 330 (ep. 2) and by the Council of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> (can. 21) in 361. At present, among the Greeks and other orientals, as also formerly in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, subdeaconship is only a <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor order</a>. It has been counted among the major orders in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, however, for nearly seven centuries. It seems to have been elevated to the rank of a sacred order in the thirteenth century, but it is impossible to fix the precise date. <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a>, at the close of the eleventh century, expressly limited the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacred orders</a> to <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a>, and in the middle of the twelfth century, <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a> still calls the subdeaconship a <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor order</a>. But at the end of the twelfth century, Peter Cantor (De verbo mirifico) says that the subdiaconate had lately been made a sacred order. Early in the thirteenth the <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> authoritatively declared that the subdeaconship was to be enumerated among the major orders and that subdeacons could be chosen to a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> without special <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> (Cap. 9. x, de &aelig;t., 1, 14). The reason for this change of discipline was probably not because subdeacons were bound to <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> for this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> began to be imposed upon them in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> in the fifth and sixth centuries [thus <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a> in 446 (in c. 1, dist. 32) and the Council of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> in 538], but more likely because their functions brought them so closely into the service of the altar.

<p>Subdeaconship is conferred when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> gives the empty <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a> to the candidate to be touched, saying: "See what kind of ministry is given to you, etc." Two ceremonies following, the presentation of the <a href="../cathen/04543a.htm">cruets</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> and the imposition of the vestments, are not essential and need not be supplied if omitted (S. R. C., 11, March, 1820). Then the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> gives the candidate the Book of Epistles to be touched, saying: "Take the Book of Epistles and receive power to read them in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">holy Church of God</a> for the living and the dead in the name of the Lord." In case of omission, this rite must be supplied and is probably an essential part of the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> (S. C. C., 11 Jan., 1711). In the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, there is a <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> and a suitable <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, but there is no <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that a letter of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (A.D. 1204) is cited as requiring that if the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> in the subdeaconship be omitted, it must be afterwards supplied (cap. 1, x, de sacr. non interand, 1. 6), but there seems no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the word "deaconship" was in the original text (Correct. Rom. ad cit. cap. 1).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of a subdeacon are to serve the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> at Mass; to prepare the <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> and sacred <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">vessels</a> for the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>; to present the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a> at the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a>, and pour water into the wine for the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>; to chant the Epistles solemnly; to wash the sacred linen. In the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, subdeacons prepare the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> at the prothesis and guard the gates of the sanctuary during the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>. In the ancient <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, the subdeacons administered in great part the temporal goods of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and were often employed on important missions by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. A candidate for the subdiaconate must have been confirmed and have received <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>. He must have the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> befitting his grade in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and have entered on his twenty-second year. He must also have acquired a title to orders. After <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, he is bound to <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> and to the recitation of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>.
