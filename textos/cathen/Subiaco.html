<h1>Subiaco </h1>  

<p>(SUBLACUM, SUBLACEUM, SUBLAQUEM).

<p>A city in the Province of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, twenty-five miles from <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tivoli</a>, received its name from the artificial lakes of the villa of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> and is renowned for its sacred grotto (Sagro Speco), the Abbey of St. Scholastica, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> residence and Church of St. Andrew, which crowns the hill. When <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">St. Benedict</a>, at the age of fourteen, retired from the world he lived for three years in a cave above the River Anio, supplied with the necessaries of life by a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, St. Roman. The grotto became the cradle of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>.- St. Benedict was able to build twelve <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and to place twelve <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in each. The one at the grotto seems to have had but a short existence; in 854 we find a record of its renovation. In this year <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Leo IV</a> is said to have <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> an altar to Sts. Benedict and Scholastica and another to St. Sylvester. Another renovation took place in 1053 under Abbot Humbert of St. Scholastica. Abbot John V, created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, made the grotto the terminus of a yearly procession, built a new road, and had the altars reconsecrated. Shortly before 1200 there existed a community of twelve, which <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> made a <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a>; <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> in 1312 appointed a special <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. A new road was built by the city in 1688. The sacred grotto is still a favourite <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, and on 27 October 1909, <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> granted a daily plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> to those who receive <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> there and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> according to the intention of the Holy Father (Acta. Ap. Sedis, II, 405). A short description of the grotto the church, and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, is given by Chandlery, "Pilgrim Walks in Rome" (New York, 1908), p. 469. The Abbey of St. Scholastica, about a mile and a half below the grotto was built by St. Benedict himself (about 520), and endowed by the Roman patricians, Tertullus and &AElig;quitius. The second <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, <a href="../cathen/07451a.htm">St. Honoratus</a>, changed the old <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> into a chapter room and built a new one, dedicating it to Sts. Cosmas and Damian. It was destroyed by the Lombards in 601 and abandoned for a century. By order of <a href="../cathen/08423b.htm">John VII</a> it was rebuilt by Abbot Stephen and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to Sts. Benedict and Scholastica. Demolished in 840 by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> and again in 981 by the Hungarians, it rose from its ruins. <a href="../cathen/02428d.htm">Benedict VII</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the new church, and henceforth the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was known by the name St. Scholastica. In 1052 <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> came to Subiaco to settle various disputes and to correct abuses; a similar visit was made by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>. Special favour was shown by <a href="../cathen/11514b.htm">Pascal II</a>, who took the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tivoli</a> and made it an abbacy nullius. Its temporal welfare was also a care of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. Thus, among others, <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, at his visit, in 1203, increased the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. With the decline of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">religious fervour</a>, strifes and dissension arose to such an extent that Abbot Bartholomew in 1364, by command of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, had to dismiss some of the incorrigible <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and fill their places with religious from other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Numbers were brought in from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and for many decades Subiaco was a centre of German thrift, <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, and art. Still, it seems the discipline was not satisfactory, for <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a> (1378-89) abolished the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> for life, took away from the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> the right of election, and gave the administration and revenues to a member of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>. <a href="../cathen/03187a.htm">Callistus III</a>, in 1455, gave the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> <a href="../cathen/07719a.htm">in commendan</a> to a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. The first of these was the Spanish Cardinal Torquemada and the second <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Roderigo Borgia</a> (later <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>), who remodeled the Castrum Sublacence, once the summer resort of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, and made it the residence of the <a href="../cathen/04155b.htm">commendatory abbot</a>.

<p>Many of these <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> cared but little for the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and looked only for the revenues. As an example, Pompeo Colonna, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13054a.htm">Rieti</a>, <a href="../cathen/04155b.htm">commendatory abbot</a> since 1506, squandered the goods of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and gave the income to unworthy subjects. On complaint of the community, in 1510, <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> readjusted matters and restored the monastic possessions. For spiritual benefit a union had been made between Subiaco and the <a href="../cathen/05785d.htm">Abbey of Farfa</a>, but it lasted only a short time. In 1514 Subiaco joined the Congregation of St. Justina, whose abbot-general was titular of St. Scholastica, while a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> remained <a href="../cathen/04155b.htm">commendatory abbot</a>. Even after this union there were quarrels between Subiaco and <a href="../cathen/05785d.htm">Farfa</a>, Subiaco and <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>. After this but little is known about the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> until the middle of the nineteenth century. In 1851 some of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, with consent of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, formed a separate province, though still belonging to the Congregation of St. Justina. Soon other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in various parts of the world wished to join this union, and <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 9 March, 1872, established the Cassinese Congregation of primitive observance. This congregation, known also as the Congregatio Sublacensis, has had a marvellous growth for, according to the "Famili&aelig; Confderat&aelig;" of 1910, it embraces 35 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in 5 provinces, with a total of 1050 religious. The troubles of Subiaco did not cease for by order of 19 June, 1873, the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was sequestrated by the Italian Government, the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> declared a national monument, and the religious tolerated as custodians of the same. At first but few <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> remained, but in 1897 there was a again a community of 25 and the "Famili&aelig; Confderat&aelig;" of 1910 notes 21 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 10 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, 8 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, and 3 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>. On 7 January, 1909, <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> restored to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> the right of electing their own <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. On the 28th they elected Lawrence Salvi. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> conferred on him the right of wearing the cappa magna on 17 Feb., and four days later Salvi received the abbatial benediction. In 1904 Luigi Cardinal Macchi resigned his office as <a href="../cathen/04155b.htm">commendatory abbot</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> retained the position for himself ordering the Acts of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> to bear the heading: "Pius X Abbas Sublacensis". The abbacy nullius comprises 24 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 91 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (<a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, and secular), and 23,000 inhabitants [Annuaire Pont. Eccl&eacute;s. (1911) 339]. The episcopal functions are performed by Victor M. Corvaia, O.S.B., <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15060a.htm">Tripolis</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> and archives were once of great value. In Subiaco, the German printers, Sweinheim and Pannartz, found home and printed "Donatus pro parvulis", "Lactantius", (1465), and <a href="../fathers/1201.htm">"De Civitate Dei"</a> (1467). Today the printing press is doing valuable work; in 1908 appeared "Petri Boherii in Regulam S. Benedicti Commentarium nunc primum editum cura et studio P. Allodi".
