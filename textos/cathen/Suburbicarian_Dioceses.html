<h1>Suburbicarian Dioceses</h1>  

<p>A name applied to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> nearest <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a>, <a href="../cathen/06243a.htm">Frascati</a> (Tusculum), <a href="../cathen/11421a.htm">Palestrina</a>, Sabina, <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia and Velletri</a>, Porto and S. Rufina, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of which form the order of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">cardinal bishops</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">See of Albano</a> (<em>Albanensis</em>) has its <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, on the site of a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> built by Constantine, on the Appian Way, about ten miles from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The name corresponds to the Latin <em>ager Albanus</em> which commemorated the ancient city of Alba Longa, famous in Roman history. The diocese now comprises twelve <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and has a population of 41,000. <a href="../cathen/06243a.htm">Frascati</a>, the ancient Tusculum, is in the Alban Hills, twelve miles from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The diocese (<em>Tusculana</em>) contains eight <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and has a population of 16,000; within its limits is the famous <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> Abbey of Grottaferrata. The capital of the <a href="../cathen/11421a.htm">Diocese of Palestrina</a> (<em>Praenestinensis</em>) is the ancient Praeneste, on the Via Labicana. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, divided into twenty-four <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, has a population of 45,700. The Diocese of Sabina (<em>Sabinensis</em>) was formed out of three oldest <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>: S. Maria in Vescovio, Corese, and Mentana. Corese is the ancient Cures, which was, in remote ages, the Sabina capital; hence, obviously, the name <em>Sabina</em>. This, the largest of the suburbicarian <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, contains some 55,000 inhabitants, in thirty-five <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia and Velletri</a> (<em>Ostiensis et Veliternensis</em>) was formed in the twelfth century by the union of the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Velletri</a> (the ancient Velitrae of the Volscians) with that of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>. The latter place was the seaport of ancient <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This diocese has sixteen <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with 34,000 inhabitants. Porto, opposite <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> at the mouth of the Tiber, was the Roman port (<em>portus</em>) constructed by the Emperor Claudius. The Basilica of Sts. Rufina and Secundus, about fourteen miles from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, on the Via Aureliana, having become the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the fifth century, this see was eventually united with that of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>. The diocese (<em>Portuensis et S. Rufinae</em>) has eighteen <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with a population of about 5000.

<p>The term <em>suburbicarius</em> is taken from Roman public law, the expression <em>regiones</em> or <em>provinciae suburbicariae</em> meaning the districts adjacent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The term <em>ecclesiae suburbicariae</em> occurs first in Rufinus [Hist. eccl., I (x), 6], where he refers to the sixth canon of Nicaea treating of the extension of the patriarchal power of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Rufinus certainly uses the words in the sense of "all the Churches <em>de facto</em> subject to the <em>episcopus urbicus</em>, that is, of Rome", meaning all the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Churches of the West</a>. The so-called Old (<em>prisca</em>) Version of the Nicene canons says that the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> extends over "suburbicaria loca et omnem provinciam suam", where <em>suburbicarius</em> is certainly more restricted in meaning than in the passage from Rufinus, and so must have been employed as it was used in Roman public law. In fairly recent times the expression was used synonymously with <em>suburbanus</em>, that is "in the immediate vicinity of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>", to signify the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>.

<p>Naturally these <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> had a certain importance in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Some authorities have suggested that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were mere auxiliaries of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, subject, however, to his. Certainly they had some prerogatives. For instance, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, in the fourth century and probably in the third, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; in the sixth century the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a> recited the second <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Porto the third. In the eighth century we read (Vita Stephani, III) of the most ancient custom in virtue of which seven of these <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, called <em>hebdomadarii</em>, celebrated <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in turn in place of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and were called <em>episcopi cardinales</em>, from being permanently attached to the <em>cardo</em>, that is the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; but we are not told who they were. In the eleventh century there were seven (six after the union of Porto and Silva Candida). Besides the titles <em>episcopi hebdomadarii</em> (twelfth century) and <em>cardinales Romanae Sedis</em> they were also known as <em>Vicarii</em> and <em>Cooperatores papae</em> and <em>episcopi romani</em>. The last title must have had a wider signification, as it was used of other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> besides the seven, like the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tivoli</a>, Gabii (united later with <a href="../cathen/11421a.htm">Palestrina</a>), Lavicum (united with Tusculum), <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Velletri</a>, Nepi, and <a href="../cathen/13683b.htm">Segni</a>. In addition to the districts already mentioned these <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had others. For instance the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Porto had ordinary delegated <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in Trastevere, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Silva Candida in the Leonine city and also in the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Basilica of St. Peter</a>. Both had residence on the Tiber island, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a> had an episcopal residence near the Lateran. Probably as early as the eleventh century these <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had the right of participating in the election of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; the Constitution of <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a> (1059), which fixed the right of electing the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as belonging exclusively to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal clerics</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, supposes that the former already enjoyed the right.

<p>As the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">cardinal-bishops</a> are largely absorbed in the business of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>, some of them, in particular the Bishops of Sabina and <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Velletri</a>, have for centuries had <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishops</a>. <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, in his Constitution "Apostolicae Romanorum" (1910), ordained that there should be suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for all the suburbicarian <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The Constitution decrees that: <ol> <li>the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">cardinal-bishop</a> is always the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the suburbicarian see; <li>each <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">cardinal-bishop</a> shall in future have a <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as suffragan, <li>who shall be nominated by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; to take possession of his office the nominee must present to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> the document containing his <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a>; <li>in virtue of the present Constitution it is presumed that the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">cardinal-bishop</a> has given his suffragan all the faculties <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the government of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, such as other resident <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have, with the following restrictions: <li>the auxiliary governs the diocese in the name and place of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; <li>with the death or transfer of the latter the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the auxiliary does not cease, he continues to rule the diocese as administrator Apostolic; <li>he must make an annual report to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> on the moral and <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> condition of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; <li>where possible, a part of the episcopal palace shall be set aside for the suffragan and the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>; <li>the blessing of the <a href="../cathen/07421b.htm">holy oils</a>, the pontifical celebrations on the greater feasts of the year in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/03133a.htm">"Caeremoniale"</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, is reserved to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, who may, however, delegate the auxiliary; <li>the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of celebrating Mass for the people is imposed on the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, who <li>has the right of having his coat-of-arms on the palace, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and other customary places; <li>the episcopal throne is reserved to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> whose name alone is mentioned in the canon; <li>the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, even when absent from the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, can grant an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of 200 days; <li>if the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> is in the diocese he alone may officiate, or grant permission to officiate, pontifically; <li>the auxiliary may not grant <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> in the chapter and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> not reserved to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> without the consent of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; <li>the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> may personally supervise and visit the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; <li>the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> retains the right of assisting at marriages and of administering the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. The auxiliary is charged specially with examining candidates for <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and the other orders; but he may not confer or authorize the conferring of orders without the permission of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; <li>the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod is to be held with the consent and in the name of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, who alone has the right of approving and <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgating</a> its decrees; <li>uniting or dividing <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, even <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a>, requires the consent of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, who <li>is to be consulted on appointments to offices and chairs in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; <li>after the death or transfer of the suffragan, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> through his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar general</a> shall provide for the government of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> till the appointment of a new suffragan; <li>when a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">cardinal-bishop</a> dies the same ceremonies shall take place as are customary on the deaths of resident <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">cardinal-bishops</a>. </ol>
