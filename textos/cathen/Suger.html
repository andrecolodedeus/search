<h1>Suger</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St-Denis, statesman and historian, b. probably at or near St-Denis, about 1081; d. there, 13 Jan., 1151. Towards 1091 he was offered to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St-Denis where he became a fellow-student of King Louis VI. From 1104 to 1106 he attended another <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, perhaps that of St-Beno&icirc;t-sur-Loire near Orl&eacute;ans. He became secretary to Abbot Adam of St-Denis in 1106, was named <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of Berneval in Normandy towards 1107 and of Toury in Beauce in 1109. Louis IV sent him (1118) to the Court of Gelasius II at Maguelonne in Southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and later to that of <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. During his stay at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1121-22) he was elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St-Denis, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> on his return. He attended the First General Council of the Lateran in 1123, and so favourably impressed <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a> that eighteen months after his return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, desirous of conferring new honours (probably the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>) upon him, invited him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Suger proceeded as far as Lucca, but retraced his steps upon receipt of the news of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> death. Henceforth most of his time was spent at Court until 1127, when he initiated, and subsequently successfully accomplished, the reform of his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. He continued to remain, however, the constant advisor of Louis VI and of his successor Louis VII. During the latter's absence on the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section2">Second Crusade</a> he was appointed regent of the kingdom (1147-49). He had opposed the king's departure on the ground that the powerful and turbulent vassals were a danger to the royal power, but so successful was his administration that the king, upon his return, bestowed upon him the title of "Father of the Country". Although the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> ended in failure, Suger equipped an army and was about to depart for the Holy Land when he died. As a statesman he sought to strengthen the royal power, to improve agriculture, commerce, and trade, and to reform the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. As <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> he not only introduced thorough-going reforms, but also completed in 1144 the new monastic church. He has left an account of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the edifice, "Libellus de consecratione eccl. S. Dionysii", and a memoir on his own abbatical administration, "Liber de rebus in administratione sua gestis". Of greater importance for the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the period are his "Vita Ludovici Grossi regis", a eulogistic but reliable life of Louis the Fat, and "Historia Ludovici VII", a history of Louis VII, which in its present form is the work of a <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of St-Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s. We also possess of him some letters, official documents, and a will of the year 1137.
