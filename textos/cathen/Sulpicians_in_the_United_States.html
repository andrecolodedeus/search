<h1>Sulpicians in the United States</h1>  

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> came to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> at the very rise of the American Hierarchy. When the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> was threatening to involve them in the impending ruin of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the superior-general, Father Emery, looking for a place of refuge abroad, was meditating an establishment at Gallipolis, a French settlement on the Ohio; but the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Cardinal Dugnani, made the happier suggestion of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, which had just been erected into the first American see. An interview in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> between Bishop Carroll, who had come to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (1790) for episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, and Father Nagot resulted in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> gladly accepting the offer of Father Emery to found a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. On 10 July, 1791, four <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> landed at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>: Francis Charles Nagot, <a href="../cathen/14336a.htm">Superior</a>, Anthony Gamier, Michael Levadoux, and John Tessier. They purchased the One Mile Tavern on the edge of the city, dedicated the house to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, and in October opened classes with five students whom they had brought from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. This was the beginning of St. Mary's, the first American <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, which still stands on the same spot. The number of <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> was augmented the following year by the arrival of Flaget, David, Chicoisneau, Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal, Richard, and Ciquard, and in 1795 by the accession of Dubourg, nearly all of whom were destined to become important figures in the history of the American Church. These ten or eleven new workers were a large accession to the small body of American <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, then only about thirty-five, who were endeavouring to serve a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> extending from the Atlantic to the Mississippi Valley. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was in its infancy; there was no organized community of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (since the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Jesuits</a>), no teaching sisterhood, no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. An academy for boys was about to open at <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown</a>. Non-Catholic <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> was almost as backward as the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. In these conditions Bishop Carroll's greatest need and most difficult task, as he had long recognized, was to recruit a sufficiently numerous and fit <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, if possible native, which he could hope for only from a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. Naturally, he welcomed the coming of the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> as "a great and auspicious event" for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>.

<p>But the time was not ripe for a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> as there were no students prepared to enter it. Georgetown Academy, founded chiefly to develop <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> vocations, instead of being an aid to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> drew on St. Mary's few students to recruit its teaching staff. The natural remedy of opening a preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> was forbidden (see below). The almost hopeless condition may be judged from the fact that during each of the first three years there were only five students and in the next year, 1794, only two, nearly all of whom were from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>; from 1795 to 1797 there were none at all. So with little or no opportunity of cultivating their own field, the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> offered themselves to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for any work at hand. Flaget, David, Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal, and Dubourg taught at the Georgetown Academy; Dubourg, an enterprising and energetic man, being made president (1796-99), greatly increased its numbers and prestige. Ciquard worked among the Indians of Maine; Levadoux, Dilhet, and Richard among the French and the Indians of Illinois and Michigan. Richard, still well remembered at <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, which some years ago placed his <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> on the city hall, deserves special mention. He restored religion, established <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, founded a young ladies' academy and a preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for young <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> set up the first printing press in the West, published the first newspaper in <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a> and the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>; was a founder, vice-president, and professor of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of Michigan and the only <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> ever elected to Congress. <a href="../cathen/06367b.htm">Gallitzin</a>, a pioneer <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in Western <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, converted six thousand non-Catholics. The <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> ministered in the churches of the city and the missions of the country. They were considered as <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and are credited with having introduced into the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> some of the dignity and splendour of old-world <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship.
<h2>St. Mary's Seminary</h2>

<p>After a trial of ten or eleven years the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> had no prospects of success; an academy which Dubourg had opened for foreign boys was not allowed to receive Americans (see below); the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> there had no means of support. Meanwhile, the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution in France</a> had passed, religion was restored by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> were being reopened. In these circumstances of 1802 only one course seemed possible to the superior-general in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>: to recall his subjects to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> gradually. Bishop Carroll, who had the highest esteem for the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> and regarded them as the hope of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, was very deeply afflicted by this resolution, and in many letters begged Father Emery not to carry it out. "If it be necessary for me", he wrote, "to bear the terrible trial of seeing the greater number of them depart, I implore you to leave here at least a germ which may produce fruit in the season decreed by the Lord." Nevertheless, Gamier (who afterwards became superior-general), Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal, and Levadoux departed for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1803, though with the greatest reluctance; Nagot was detained from going by ill-health. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> seemed doomed. It was saved by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, whom Father Emery, moved by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> appeals, consulted at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1804. "My son," said the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, "let it stand, let that <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> stand. It will bear fruit in its own time." Father Emery accepted these words as the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> remained. But progress was slow; St. Mary's College, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and Mt. St. Mary's, Emmitsburg, both founded by the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> (see below), furnished few students to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. Still, Bishop Carroll had the consolation of seeing thirty <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> from there before his death in 1815.



<p>Under the second superior, Father Tessier (1810-29), the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> became solidly established, although the number of ordinations averaged only two or three a year. His chief support up to 1817 was Father Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal, whose abilities raised him in that year to the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. In 1822 St. Mary's Seminary was endowed by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> with all the privileges of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. The third superior, Father Louis Regis Deluol (1829-49), a man of exceptional ability and character, exerted a strong influence not only on the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and college over which he presided, but on the general affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in America. St. Charles' College was founded during his administration. St. Mary's College was suppressed under his successor, Father Francis L'Homme (1849-60). The <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> immigration, the spread of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and the foundation of St. Charles' College, contributed to render the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> as fruitful in vocation in the one decade of Father L'Homme's administration as it had been in the preceding sixty years. Two directors at St. Mary's, Fathers Alphonse Flammant (1856-64) and Francis Paulinus Dissez (1857-1907), deserve mention here as saintly men who deeply influenced Cardinal Gibbons, the first Archbishop Keane of <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, and other leaders of the American Church. A half-century of teaching at St. Mary's made Father Dissez one of the best known and most <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of America.

<p>St. Mary's prospered and grew under the fourth superior, Father Joseph Paul Dubreul (1860-78), and still more under his successor, <a href="../cathen/09533b.htm">Father Alphonse Magnien</a> (1878-1902), who saw an enrolment of over three hundred students. Father Dubreul built the central portion of the present <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in 1878: the building was completed by <a href="../cathen/09533b.htm">Father Magnien</a>. All that remains from the old days is the sisters house, in which Mother Seton began her work as a Sister of Charity, and the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, built in 1806, which long served as a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church and was regarded in those days as a gem of architecture. Both Dubreul and <a href="../cathen/09533b.htm">Magnien</a> were marked types of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> ecclesiastic, and moulded the character of hundreds of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> now living. Probably no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in our day was better known or better <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> than the good and genial "Abb&eacute;" <a href="../cathen/09533b.htm">Magnien</a>. He was the close friend and trusted adviser of Cardinal Gibbons, who said of him some time after his death: "I had been so much accustomed to consult the venerable Abb&eacute; on important questions, and to lean upon him in every emergency, that . . . I feel as if I had lost my right arm. He was indeed <em>dimidium anim&oelig; me&oelig;</em>." The present superior, Father Edward Randall Dyer, D.D., was appointed in Aug., 1902, after <a href="../cathen/09533b.htm">Father Magnien's</a> health had failed. St. Mary's Seminary has given over thirty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and eighteen hundred <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of America, of whom more than fourteen hundred are still living. The largest of our American <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, and national in its scope, it draws its students from every quarter of the country. It has always taken a leading part in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> conferences of the <a href="../cathen/05305a.htm">Catholic Educational Association</a>. It was the scene of the Third Plenary Council and of many notable <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> gatherings. Its archives and <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> are rich in materials of early American Church History.
<h2>St. Mary's College, Baltimore</h2>

<p>The impossibility of getting students for the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> led the fathers to teach Latin to a few boys in 1793-94, in the hope of recruiting vocations; but this was discontinued through fear of injuring the Georgetown Academy. Father Dubourg resigned the presidency of Georgetown in 1799 in order to found a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at <a href="../cathen/07153b.htm">Havana</a>. Unsuccessful in the attempt, he returned to <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> in Aug., 1799, with three young <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>; these, with a few French boys, he lodged and instructed at the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. In the following year a building was erected for them alongside the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and the institution was named St. Mary's College. In deference to the wishes of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, no American boys were admitted, but many students came from <a href="../cathen/04558c.htm">Cuba</a>, <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">San Domingo</a>, <a href="../cathen/08270a.htm">Jamaica</a>, and Porto Rico, besides French boys from the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. In 1803 the doors were opened to American students, without distinction of creed; and in 1805 the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was raised to the rank of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> by an act of the legislature. The students numbered then, or in the following year, 106, which was considered a remarkable success; for the history of all higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> up to that time had been, almost without exception, a record of failures. It drew students from the whole country, but chiefly from <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> and the neighbouring states, north and south. Many were non-Catholics. Some continued to come from the West Indies and from Central America. The <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> had vicissitudes chiefly financial, but it maintained a high standard and enjoyed a high reputation, for it was conducted by able men who brought the culture of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to a country where <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was still in a very crude condition. Its student roll rose at times to two hundred or over. Among its eleven presidents are numbered Archbishops Dubourg and <a href="../cathen/05269a.htm">Eccleston</a>, and Bishops David, Brut&eacute;, and Chance; and the names of many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and notable <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and citizens are found on the list of its professors and students.

<p>Despite its half-century of useful and distinguished work, it did not adequately fulfil the main purpose of its foundation; a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, frequented by sons of rich <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and containing many non-Catholics, was found unfavourable to the fostering, and even to the preservation, of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> vocations. Accordingly it was resolved in 1848, on the occasion of the official visit of <a href="../cathen/05752b.htm">Father Faillon</a> from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, to suppress St. Mary's College and start an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> college. In the autumn of that year, St. Charles' College was opened (see below); and in 1852 St. Mary's College by order of the superior-general, Father de Courson, was closed at the height of its prosperity. By an understanding with the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Loyola College supplied its place.
<h2>Mount St. Mary's, Emmitsburg</h2>

<p>The necessity of a strictly <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> had forced itself upon the mind of Father Nagot in the first years of St. Mary's College. In 1806 this saintly old man of over seventy gathered about a dozen boys around him at Pigeon Hill, Adams Co., <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, in a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> region that had long been ministered to by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. After two years of instruction, they were transferred to the care of the Rev. John Dubois, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Emmitsburg, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, who himself was already instructing a few boys. In 1808 Father Dubois, who had become a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Sulpician, acquired land and built Mount St. Mary's College, in the name of the Society of St. Sulpice. He did heroic work, single-handed, as teacher and as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. In 1812 he was joined by Father Brut&eacute;. Together they were the main factors in creating a flourishing college where the spirit of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> reigned and was very fruitful in vocations. Mount St. Mary's, founded to supply vocations to St. Mary's Seminary, became a rival by force of circumstances, for it could obtain teachers only by retaining the graduates of the college who taught the younger boys at the same time they pursued their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> studies. It also became a rival of St. Mary's College when it began to admit boys who did not aspire to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and even non-Catholics. For these, and also for financial reasons, the Society of St.Sulpice in 1826 made an amicable separation from Mount St. Mary's, which has continued the noble spirit of Brut&eacute; and Dubois and done invaluable services to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of America.
<h2>St. Charles' College, Ellicott City</h2>

<p>Persisting in the effort to establish a purely <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> college, according to the spirit of their vocation and the mind of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, in 1831, laid the cornerstone of St. Charles' College, near Ellicott City, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. The ground, together with a small sum of money, had been donated by <a href="../cathen/03379c.htm">Charles Carroll of Carrollton</a>, who survived to witness the cornerstone laying. Lack of funds long delayed the completion of the college. It was opened in 1848 with four students by the Rev. Oliver Jenkins, who became its first president. In ten or twelve years the students numbered over a hundred. Here, at last, was a strictly <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> college, firmly established, giving a solid classical <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and maintaining the purest traditions of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> discipline and spirit. St. Charles' became well known throughout the country, no section of which has not been well represented among its student body. The enrolment for years has been about two hundred. It has trained over fourteen hundred <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for the American Church and pointed the way to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> colleges now becoming numerous and most helpful. Father Jenkins remained president till 1869, though he had been temporarily replaced by the Revs. G. Raymond (1849-51) and S. Fert&eacute;, D.D. (1851-52). His successors have been Father Fert&eacute; (1869-76), Revs. P. P. Denis (1876-86), F. M. L. Dumont (1886-94), Charles B. Rex (1894-97), Charles B. Schrantz (1897-1906), and F. X. McKenny. To the older generations of students the best remembered of the professors is Father J. B. Menu, who for forty years (1849-88) "hammered Latin and Greek into the most stubborn heads". The best known to the outside world is <a href="../cathen/14423c.htm">Father John B. Tabb</a>, a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> poet, whose exquisite lyrics have won him a secure place in <a href="../cathen/05458a.htm">English literature</a>. The spacious building, with its beautiful <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, its <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>, and valuable documents, was destroyed by fire on 16 March, 1911. Classes were resumed in a few weeks in temporary quarters at Cloud Gap, near Baltimore. On that spot the fathers have now begun (1912) the construction of a new and greater St. Charles.
<h2>St. John's Seminary, Brighton</h2>

<p>Opened in 1884 and entrusted by the Most Rev. John J. Williams, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, to the care of the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, whose pupil he had been at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Its presidents have been the Very Revs. John Hogan (1884-89, 1894-1901), Charles B. Rex (1889-94), Daniel E. Maher (1901-06), and Francis P. Havey (1906-11). In June, 1911, at the request of the Most Rev. William H. O'Connell, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> withdrew from the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>.
<h2>St. Joseph's Seminary, Yonkers</h2>

<p>Archbishop Hughes, who had been their pupil at <a href="../cathen/10605a.htm">Mount St. Mary's</a>, had desired the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, in 1862, to assume charge of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> about to be opened at Troy, New York. This wish was carried out only in 1896, under <a href="../cathen/04395a.htm">Archbishop Corrigan</a>, when St. Joseph's Seminary was transferred to Dunwoodie, Yonkers, New York. The first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> was the Very Rev. E. R. Dyer, 1896-1902. Called to the presidency of St. Mary's Seminary, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, he was succeeded by the Very Rev. James F. Driscoll. In January, 1906. Father Driscoll and four of his associates withdrew from the Society of St-Sulpice, and were accepted by Archbishop Farley into his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, continuing their work in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, which thus passed from the charge of the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>.
<h2>St. Patrick's Seminary, Menlo Park</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, whose houses had hitherto been located in the Atlantic states, accepted a call to the Far West in 1898. Most of the students for the San Francisco archdiocese had for many years been sent to St. Mary's Seminary, Baltimore. A long-cherished desire of Archbishop Riordan was realized when St. Patrick's Seminary was opened 20 Sept., 1898, under the care of the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>. The institution was to comprise a preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> or college and a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> proper, of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. It began with only three classes of the college department, the succeeding classes in the college and <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> being added according as the students were prepared. Very Rev. A. J. B. Vuibert was the first president of the college department, and had under him, at the beginning, seven professors, four of whom were <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, and twenty-eight students. He was succeeded in 1911 by Rev. John J. Doran, S.S. The <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> department was opened in 1904, when Very Rev. Henry A. Ayrinhac, S.S., D.D., became president of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. The magnificent structure was greatly damaged in the earthquake of 1906, but was soon restored, thanks to the characteristic energy of Archbishop Riordan. There are at present over one hundred students in this flourishing and hopeful young <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>.
<h2>Catholic university</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, in granting a constitution to the <a href="../cathen/03455a.htm">Catholic University of America</a>, laid upon the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of caring for the discipline and <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual direction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students and of assisting them in the choice and pursuit of their studies. Divinity College was opened in October, 1889, under Very Rev. John B. Hogan, who remained president till 1894. His successors have been Very Revs. F. M. L. Dumont (1894-1911), and John F. Fenlon.
<h2>St. Austin's college</h2>

<p>The aspirants to the Society of St-Sulpice pursue their studies in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, undistinguished from the other students; until recently, the American aspirants generally were sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> or <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> for post-graduate studies after <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> and to the Solitude at Issy, near <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, for their <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. In Oct., 1901, the American scholasticate of the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, known as St. Austin's College, was opened near the Catholic University, Washington. The students, who are received only after having completed their <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> studies, follow courses at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, or letters, to prepare themselves for work in college or <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. It has been presided over by Very Revs. James F. Driscoll (1901-02), Daniel P. Duffy (1902-04), John F. Fenlon (1904-11), and Francis P. Havey. In 1911 the first American <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, known as the Solitude, was begun in this house under Father Havey as director.

<p>The government of the Sulpician houses in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was, until recent years, dependent directly upon the superior-general in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. In 1903 the President of St. Mary's Seminary, Father Dyer, was appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the Superior of St-Sulpice, an office resembling that of provincial in a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order. He governs ordinary Sulpician affairs in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> with the advice and assistance of his council. In the early days of the American <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> several <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> were among its members: Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal (1817-28), and <a href="../cathen/05269a.htm">Eccleston</a> (1834-51), <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>; Flaget, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bardstown (1810-50), with David (1819-41), and Chabrat (1834-47), as coadjutors; Dubourg, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> (1815-26), died <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a> in 1833; Dubois of New York (1826-42); Brut&eacute;, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vincennes (1834-39), who, with Flaget and David, is well remembered for great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of life; Chance, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10709b.htm">Natchez</a> (1841-52); V&eacute;rot, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13488a.htm">Savannah</a> (1859-70); afterwards first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Augustine (1870-76), of which he had been <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> in 1858; and O'Farrell, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15037a.htm">Trenton</a> (1881-94). More than twenty American <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, past and present, and more than sixty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have received their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> formation, at least in part, in Sulpician houses at home or abroad. All the rectors of the Catholic University have been their pupils. Father David, sent by Father Emery with Bishop Flaget to establish a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, founded St. Thomas's Seminary at Bardstown, and taught its students almost singlehanded for many years. The diocese had only three <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> when he arrived in 1810; he trained up forty-seven, mostly natives, of whom the most illustrious is Martin J. Spalding. To this little-known <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> is attributed the greatest part in the preservation and spread of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in Kentucky.

<p>Six <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> in all, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, Bardstown, Brighton, Emmitsburg, Dunwoodie, and Menlo Park were founded or directed by <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, and their traditions and spirit have been carried into many new institutions by their alumni. Largely through their efforts, the Propagation of the Faith was established in this country and for a long time developed. The Sisters of Charity at Emmitsburg were established by their direction and co-operation, and united, through Father Deluol, to the foundation of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Father Joubert founded the coloured sisterhood of the Oblates at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and Father David the Sisters of Nazareth, in <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>. Bishop Dubourg introduced the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Vincentians</a> into the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, also the Religious of the Sacred Heart. He was the founder of St. Louis Latin Academy which developed, under the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, into the St. Louis University. On Flaget's invitation the Good Shepherd Sisters came to this country. In the early days the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> ministered to the coloured <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and since the foundation of St. Joseph's Seminary for work among the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a>, its students have made their <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> studies at St. Mary's. The secretarial work of the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">Negro</a> and Indian Commission has always been carried on in connexion with St. Mary's Seminary. The fathers of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> have acted as secretaries or <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> and in the provincial and plenary council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. The literary productions of the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> have, almost without exception, grown directly out of their work as educators; they have written books on Latin grammar, history ancient and modern, <a href="../cathen/05458a.htm">English literature</a>, liturgy, <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a>, dogmatic and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, devotion, etc. They have translated many standard French works into English, and English into French. Their best-known writers are Father Hogan, whose "Clerical Studies" is the classic of its subject, and Father Adolphe Tanquerey, whose text-bocks on dogmatic and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> are used in numerous <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> throughout the world.
