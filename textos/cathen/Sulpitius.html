<h1>Sulpitius</h1>  

<p>Two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a> bore this name.
<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>The first, St. Sulpitius the Severe, wrongly identified with Sulpicius Severus, the historian of St. Martin, was raised to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 584. He was, says <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a>, a man of high birth, one of the first senators of Gaul, of great oratorical talent, and expert in the art of poetical rhythms. The See of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a> having become <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> with the death of Remigius, several candidates offered gifts to King Gontran to secure the assistance of his favour. But the latter rejected all these <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> gifts to favour the election of Sulpitius. He was elected, given <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Shortly afterwards he held a council in Auvergne, to adjust the dispute which had arisen between two of his suffragans, Innocentius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13107a.htm">Rodez</a>, and Ursicinus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a>, with regard to <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> for which they contended. The council decided that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a> should retain the contested <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13107a.htm">Rodez</a> had not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that he or his predecessors had long possessed. Sulpitius assisted at a Council of <a href="../cathen/09507a.htm">M&acirc;con</a> in 585; he died in 591, his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> being inserted in the Roman Martyrology on 29 January.
<h2 id="section2">II</h2>

<p>Sulpitius the Pious (or the D&eacute;bonnaire), born at Vatan (<a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Diocese of Bourges</a>), of noble <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, before the end of the sixth century, devoted himself from his youth to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> and the study of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. Austregisilus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> him cleric of his church, then <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and finally made him director of his episcopal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Clotaire II, King of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, who had heard his merits spoken of, summoned him and made him <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of his armies. But at the death of Bishop Austregisilus (c. 624) he was recalled to Bourges to take his place. Sulpitius thenceforth laboured with much <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and success to re-establish <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>, for the relief of the poor and the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. In 626 he assisted at the Council of Clichy and held several others with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his province, but nothing of them remains. He intervened with King Dagobert in behalf of his flock, of whom a too heavy tax was exacted. At the request of the same king he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">See of Cahors</a> his treasurer St. Didier, who was his personal friend, and there are extant three letters which he addressed to him. Towards the end of his life Sulpitius took a coadjutor, Vulfolnde, and retired to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which he had founded near Bourges. There he died 17 Jan., 646, which day several Manuscripts of the Hieronymian Martyrology indicate as his feast. In his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the church bearing his name was built in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, from which the Society of St. Sulpice derives its own.
