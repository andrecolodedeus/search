<h1>Sunday</h1>  

<p>Sunday (Day of the Sun), as the name of the first day of the week, is derived from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a>. The seven planets, known to us as Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and the Moon, each had an hour of the day assigned to them, and the planet which was regent during the first hour of any day of the week gave its name to that day (see <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">CALENDAR</a>). During the first and second century the week of seven days was introduced into <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and the Roman names of the planets were given to each successive day. The Teutonic nations seem to have adopted the week as a division of time from the Romans, but they changed the Roman names into those of corresponding Teutonic <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a>. Hence the <em>dies Solis</em> became Sunday (German, <em>Sonntag</em>). Sunday was the first day of the week according to the Jewish method of reckoning, but for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> it began to take the place of the Jewish <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> in Apostolic times as the day set apart for the public and solemn worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The practice of meeting together on the first day of the week for the celebration of the Eucharistic Sacrifice is indicated in <a href="../bible/act020.htm#vrs7">Acts 20:7</a>; <a href="../bible/1co016.htm#vrs2">1 Corinthians 16:2</a>; in <a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs10">Apocalypse 1:10</a>, it is called the Lord's day. In the <a href="../fathers/0714.htm">Didache (14)</a> the injunction is given: "On the Lord's Day come together and break bread. And give thanks (offer the Eucharist), after confessing your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that your sacrifice may be pure". St. Ignatius (Ep. ad Magnes. ix) speaks of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> as "no longer observing the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, but living in the observance of the Lord's Day, on which also Our Life rose again". In the Epistle of Barnabas (xv) we read: "Wherefore, also, we keep the eight day (i.e. the first of the week) with joyfulness, the day also on which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> rose again from the dead".

<p><a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> is the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writer to call the day Sunday (I Apol., lxvii) in the celebrated passage in which he describes the worship offered by the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> on that day to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The fact that they met together and offered public worship on Sunday necessitated a certain rest from work on that day. However, <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (202) is the first writer who expressly mentions the Sunday rest: "We, however (just as tradition has taught us), on the day of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Lord's Resurrection</a> ought to guard not only against kneeling, but every posture and office of solicitude, deferring even our businesses lest we give any place to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>" ("De orat.", xxiii; cf. "Ad nation.", I, xiii; "Apolog.", xvi).

<p>These and similar indications show that during the first three centuries practice and tradition had <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the Sunday to the public worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the hearing of the Mass and the resting from work. With the opening of the fourth century positive legislation, both <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and civil, began to make these <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> more definite. The Council of Elvira (300) decreed: "If anyone in the city neglects to come to church for three Sundays, let him be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> for a short time so that he may be corrected" (xxi). In the Apostolic Constitutions, which belong to the end of the fourth century, both the hearing of the Mass and the rest from work are prescribed, and the precept is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. The express teaching of Christ and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> prevented the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> from falling into the excesses of Jewish <a href="../cathen/13287a.htm">Sabbatarianism</a> in the observance of the Sunday, and yet we find St. C&aelig;sarius of Arles in the sixth century teaching that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctors of the Church</a> had decreed that the whole glory of the Jewish <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> had been transferred to the Sunday, and that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> must keep the Sunday holy in the same way as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had been commanded to keep holy the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> Day. He especially insisted on the people hearing the whole of the Mass and not leaving the church after the Epistle and the Gospel had been read. He taught them that they should come to <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> and spend the rest of the day in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> reading and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. As with the Jewish <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, the observance of the Christian Sunday began with sundown on Saturday and lasted till the same time on Sunday. Until quite recent times some <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> taught that there was an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> under pain of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of assisting at vespers as well as of hearing <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>, but the opinion rests on no certain foundation and is now commonly abandoned. The common opinion maintains that, while it is highly becoming to be present at <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> on Sunday, there is no strict <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to be present. The method of reckoning the Sunday from sunset to sunset continued in some places down to the seventeenth century, but in general since the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the reckoning from midnight to midnight has been followed. When the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> system was introduced, the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> were taught that they must hear Mass and the preaching of the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on Sundays in their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church. However, toward the end of the thirteenth century, the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> began to teach that the precept of hearing <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> might be fulfilled by hearing it in their churches, and after long and severe struggles this was expressly allowed by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Nowadays, the precept may be fulfilled by hearing <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in any place except a strictly private oratory, and provided Mass is not celebrated on a <a href="../cathen/01348b.htm">portable altar</a> by a privilege which is merely personal.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of rest from work on Sunday remained somewhat indefinite for several centuries. A Council of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a>, held toward the end of the fourth century, was content to prescribe that on the Lord's Day the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> were to abstain from work as far as possible. At the beginning of the sixth century St. Caesarius, as we have seen, and others showed an inclination to apply the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the Jewish <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> to the observance of the Christian Sunday. The Council held at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> in 538 reprobated this tendency as Jewish and non-Christian. From the eight century the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> began to be formulated as it exists at the present day, and the local councils forbade servile work, public buying and selling, pleading in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> courts, and the public and solemn taking of <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a>. There is a large body of civil legislation on the Sunday rest side by side with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>. It begins with an Edict of Constantine, the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperor, who forbade judges to sit and townspeople to work on Sunday. He made an exception in favour of agriculture. The breaking of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of Sunday rest was punished by the Anglo-Saxon legislation in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> like other crimes and misdemeanours. After the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, under <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritan</a> influence, many <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were passed in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> whose effect is still visible in the stringency of the English <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. Still more is this the case in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. There is no federal legislation in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> on the observance of the Sunday, but nearly all the states of the Union have statutes tending to repress unnecessary labour and to restrain the liquor traffic. In other respects the legislation of the different states on this matter exhibits considerable variety. On the continent of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in recent years there have been several <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> passed in direction of enforcing the observance of Sunday rest for the benefit of workmen.
