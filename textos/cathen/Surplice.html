<h1>Surplice</h1>  

<p>A large-sleeved tunic of half-length, made of fine linen or cotton, and worn by all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The wide sleeves distinguish it from the <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>; it differs from the <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a> inasmuch as it is shorter and is never girded. It is shorter and is never girded. It is ornamented at the hem and the sleeves either with <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a>, with lace-like insertions, or with lace. The lace should never be more than fifteen inches wide, as otherwise the real vestment is necessarily too much shortened by this merely ornamental addition. The surplice belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestment in the strict sense, and is the vestment most used. It is the choir dress, the vestment for processions, the official <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dress of the lower <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the vestment worn by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in administering the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, when giving <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>, at Benediction of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, etc.; in the last-mentioned cases it is the substitute for the <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>, which, according to present custom, is worn only at Mass and a few other functions. The blessing of the surplice by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or by authorized <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is proper, but not strictly prescribed. As the distinctive <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> dress of the lower <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, after giving the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>, places it on the candidate for orders with these words: "May the Lord clothe thee with the new man, who is created in righteousness and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> after the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."
<h2>History</h2>

<p>The time of the introduction of the surplice cannot be determined. Without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> it was originally merely a choir vestment and a garment to be worn at processions, burials, and on similar occasions. As a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> dress in this sense it is met outside of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>) as early as the eleventh century, but it is not found in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> until the twelfth century. The surplice may have been used in isolated cases during the twelfth century instead of the <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a> in administering the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and at <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>, but this use did not become general until the thirteenth century. Towards the close of the twelfth century the surplice was already the distinctive dress of the lower <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, even though this was not the case everywhere. However, the placing of the surplice on the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> after the giving of the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> (cf. above), is first testified by the Pontificals of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The name of the surplice arises from the fact that it was worn by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, especially in northern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, over (<em>super</em>) the universally customary fur clothing (<em>pelliceoe</em>). This is stated by Durandus and by the English grammarian Gerlandus, both of whom lived to the thirteenth century. The fur clothing not only led to the name of the surplice, but it was probably the cause of its appearance. For it is evident that a large-sleeved, ungirdled tunic was better suited to go over heavy fur coats than a narrow-sleeved, girded <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>. It seems most probable that the surplice first appeared in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> or <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, whence its use gradually spread to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. It is possible that there is a connection between the surplice and the Gallican <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>, an ungirdled <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> tunic of the old <a href="../cathen/06357a.htm">Gallican Rite</a>, which was superseded during the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> era by the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>. The founding of the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a> in the second half of the eleventh century may have had a special influence upon the spread of the surplice. Among the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a> the surplice was not only the choir vestment, but also a part of the habit of the order. In addition to the surplice we find frequent early mention of a "cotta". It is possible that between the <em>superpelliceum</em> and the <em>cotta</em> there may have been some small difference (perhaps in length or width), but most probably these terms were only different names for the same <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestment (cf. Braun, op. cit. in bibliography, p. 142). Originally the surplice was a full-length tunic &mdash; that is, it reached to the feet. In the thirteenth century it began to be shortened, although in the fifteenth century it still reached halfway between the knee and the ankle. In the sixteenth century, however, it was so short that it frequently reached only just below the hips. As the length of the surplice was lessened, the length and breadth of the sleeves was naturally reduced, so that in this respect also there is a great difference between the original surplice and that of the eighteenth century. More striking than these mere alterations of size were other changes made in the surplice, some of which appeared as early as the thirteenth century, and by which its entire shape and appearance was more or less altered, various forms of the surplice being produced. Thus, surplices appeared with slit-up sleeves (thus with wings of material rather than sleeves); then surplices which, besides being slit up on the under side of the sleeve, were also open at the sides, the surplices being thus like <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapulars</a> in form. Also surplices without sleeves, having mere slits for the arms; finally surplices resembling the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> bell-shaped <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a> with only an opening in the middle for the head &mdash; this shape was customary in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, especially in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> territory. These variations met with the disapproval of provincial and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, but their prohibitions had not permanent effect. The <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a>-like band that took the place of the surplice among the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a> on non-liturgical occasions is not a curtailment of the surplice, but a substitute for it.
<h2>Ornamentation</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the surplice apparently seldom received rich ornamentation. In pictures and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> it appears as a garment hanging in many folds, but otherwise plain throughout. There is a surplice at Neustift near Brixen in the Tyrol that dates back to the twelfth (or, at least, to the thirteenth) century; it is the only <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> surplice that we possess. This surplice shows geometrical ornaments in white linen <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a> on the shoulders, breast, back, and below the shoulders, where, as in the <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">albs</a> of the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, large full gores have been inserted in the body of the garment. After the lace industry developed in the sixteenth century the hem and sleeves of the surplice were often trimmed with lace &mdash; at a later period, unfortunately, too often at the expense of the vestment itself. It apparently did not become customary to lay the surplice in folds until the close of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. This custom had vogue especially in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, but it frequently degenerated into undignified straining after effect and effeminate display.
