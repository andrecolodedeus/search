<h1>Switzerland</h1>  

<p>(Confederatio Helvetica)</p>

<p>A confederation in the central part of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, made up of twenty-two cantons, three of which are divided into half-cantons. The country lies between 45&#176;49'2" and 47&#176;48'32" north latitude, and 5&#176;57'26" and 10&#176;29'40" longitude east of Greenwich. Its area is 15,976 square miles. The name comes from the designation of one of the original cantons, Schwyz (Schwiz), which was extended in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> to the entire confederation.
<h2>Physical geography and ethnography</h2>

<p>As regards its <a href="../cathen/06447a.htm">physical geography</a> Switzerland is divided into three divisions: the Alps, the central region, and the Jura. The Swiss Alps form a part of the great curve of the Alpine chain of central <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>; they extend from Mont-Dolent in the chain of Mont Blanc in the west to Piz Mondin, in the Lower Engadine in the east, and have a length measured in a straight line of 170 miles. The smaller part of the Jura range, including, however, its highest peaks, is on Swiss soil. Between the Alps and the Jura extends the central region, which is traversed by countless valleys and includes about 30 per cent of the entire area of Switzerland. The highest peak of the Swiss Alps is Monte Rosa, 15,217 feet. The rivers which have their sources in Switzerland belong to one or another of the following four river-basins: the basin of the Rhine, the waters of which flow into the North Sea; the basin of the Rhone, which carries its waters to the western Mediterranean; the basin of the Po, which empties into the eastern Mediterranean; and the basin of the Inn, which empties into the Danube and with this into the Black Sea. The three river basins first mentioned have a common watershed, the range of the Gothard. Switzerland also contains a large number of lakes, the largest of which are on the edges of the Alps and the Jura, such as Geneva or Leman, <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, Neuch&acirc;tel, <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>, Lugano, Maggiore, and Z&uuml;rich. The lofty mountain chain of the Swiss Alps above a definite height is permanently covered with snow which feeds the glaciers. Switzerland contains altogether not less than 1077 glaciers, which cover an area of 709 square miles. Taken altogether 25.2 per cent of the area of Switzerland is completely unproductive.

<p>The climate of Switzerland is not uniform. The differences in temperature of the various parts are conditioned by the differences in altitude, which vary from 581 feet to 15,217 feet above sea level, and by the Alps, the southern slope of which have a Mediterranean climate, while their northern slopes show that of central <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. These striking differences determine the character of the flora and fauna. With the exception of the vegetation which flourishes on a seashore all <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> types of flora are to be found. The species of animals characteristic of the Alps are: the chamois, the ibex, the golden eagle and several other species of birds. Of the productive area 3390 square miles are covered with forests, 8427 square miles are farm and pasture lands, and 108 square miles are planted with vineyards.

<p>In 1850 the total population of Switzerland was 2,392,740 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; the census of 1910 showed 3,753,293 inhabitants; on 1 December, 1910, the resident population (those actually present in the different localities) was altogether 3,765,002 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. The original inhabitants of Switzerland were predominantly of Celtic race, although south of the Alps the Italian Lepontii lived in Ticino, and the Grisons was apparently inhabited by Etruscan Rhaeti. A mixed population appeared in most parts of the territory owing to the Roman supremacy, the arrival of the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundians</a> in the southwestern district and of the Alemanni in other parts of the country. Four different languages appeared: German in the districts inhabited by the Alamanni, French in the western regions, where the scanty <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> population intermarried with romanized Helvetii, Italian in Ticino, and Rhaeto-Romanic in the Grisons. According to the last census the inhabitants were classified, by native tongues, as follows: Of 3,765,002 inhabitants, 2,599,154 spoke German; 796,244 French; 301,325 Italian; 39,834 Romanic; 28,445 spoke other languages.
<h2>Political history</h2>

<p>In the prehistoric era the territory of the present Switzerland was partly inhabited far up into the valleys of the Alps, as is evident from remains found in various caves and graves. Switzerland entered its historical era with the overthrow of the western Helvetii by Caesar in the year 58 BC. The entire country came under the control of the Roman Empire after the eastern districts were conquered by Drusus and <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a> in 15 BC. On the organization of the Roman provinces before <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> the northwestern past of the territory of Switzerland belonged to the provinces of Germania Superior, the southwestern section (Geneva) to the Provincia Narbonensis, the eastern and the greater part of the southeastern region to the province of Rhaetia. The region of the southwestern Alps was divided into special administrative districts, of which the district of the "Alpes Poeninae" included the present canton of Valais and the adjoining portions of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. In the reorganization of the empire by <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> the province of Rhaetia and the district of the "Alpes Poeninae" were left as they were, the northwestern past of the country was included in the Province of Maxima Sequanorum, the southwestern section in the Provincia Viennensis, the southern point of Ticino to Liguria, a province of Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>.

<p>During the migrations the territory of Switzerland was occupied by two German tribes. The <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundians</a>, who had settled in 443 south of Lake Geneva, pushed northwards and occupied the southwestern and western portions of Switzerland. The mingled with the Romanic population and quickly adopted the Romanic tongue and customs, so that the language of this section remained Romanic (French). In the fifth century the Alamanni pushed forward as far as the Alps and completely destroyed Roman civilization, so that the language of this section became German. At the beginning of the sixth century all Switzerland north of the Alps fell under the supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Kingdom. At a later date, when the Lombard Kingdom was conquered by the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, the districts of Switzerland south of the Alps also came under <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> mastery. Thus Switzerland belonged to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> great empire and shared its fortunes. In the partition of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire by the Treaty of Verdun in 843 the central and eastern parts of Switzerland fell to the Kingdom of Alamannia, the western to the Kingdom of Lorraine, and later to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The power of the counts grew constantly, and in 888 Count Rudolph of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> founded the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, of which western Switzerland formed a part. The German regions of Switzerland fell to the Duchy of Swabia in 917. In the ninth and tenth centuries several dynasties rose to power and importance, as: the Houses of Z&auml;hringen (extinct 1218), of Lenzburg, of Kyburg, and of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. The inheritance of the Lenzburg <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> fell to the counts of Habsburg. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries there were some twenty great <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> ruling <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> in the present Switzerland. The counts of Z&auml;hringen sought to secure their supremacy against the attacks of the rural nobility by founding cities, as Fribourg in 1178 and Berne in 1191. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> also gradually acquired <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> and rich possessions. When Duke Burkhard of Swabia died childless in 973 the duchy reverted to the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. In 1033, after the death of King Rudolph III of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, his kingdom also fell to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, as Rudolph left it to the empire by will. Consequently the whole of present Switzerland, with the exception of Ticino, which was a part of <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, belonged to the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>.



<p>The inhabitants of the Alpine valleys of central Switzerland sought to protect their ancient <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> against the growing power of the counts of Habsburg. In 1231 the people of Uri received from the German Emperor, Henry, a charter which released them from the control of the counts of Habsburg; this is the first document by which the freedom of the early League of Switzerland was established. Schwyz received a similar charter in 1240 from <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a>. In this way the territories of Uri and Schwyz were immediately dependent on the empire. Like the people of these two territories, the inhabitants of Unterwalden had also founded a provincial confederation. During the era of the struggle over the empire, Rudolph of Habsburg strengthened his power over Switzerland; when in 1273 he became Emperor of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, his conquests transferred the center of the power of the Habsburgs to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Nevertheless, the emperor vigorously maintained his supremacy over his possessions in Switzerland. Directly after Rudolph's death (1291) the inhabitants of the districts combined in the original Swiss League sought to make use of the opportunity to secure their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges. On 1 August, 1291, the representatives of the provincial associations formed by Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden met and renewed the League that had been formed earlier. The purpose of the League was by united action to protect its members as far as possible against all attacks. The establishment of the League has been poetically embellished by the well-known story of the struggle of William Tell and his companions against the governor, Gessler, who oppressed the people.

<p>Adolph of Nassau, who was elected King of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> after the death of Rudolph of Habsburg, confirmed the charters of Uri and Schwyz, as did King Henry VII of Luxemburg on 3 June, 1309; at the same time, Henry extended the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges contained in them to Unterwalden. After the death of Henry VII (1313) an old dispute as to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> over the march between Schwyz and the abbey of <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a> broke out again and the confederated Swiss attacked the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, for which they were <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> and put under the ban of the empire at the same time. Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> withdrew the ban in 1315 and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> to recall the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of the inhabitants of the forest districts (Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, and Lucerne). In the struggle for the imperial throne between Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and Frederick of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> the Swiss League, made up of these districts, held to Louis. Frederick's brother, Duke Leopold of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, attempted to overthrow the League and to punish its members for the attack on <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a>, but his army was defeated by the Swiss at Morgarten on 15 November, 1315. On 9 December, 1315, Schwyz, Uri, and Unterwalden renewed the League and confirmed the same by additional regulations. In the truce concluded with the Duke of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> the independence of the League was in some degree recognized. The further development of political conditions and the struggle with the Habsburgs connected with it led to the union with the forest districts of the city of <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a> in 1332, the city of Z&uuml;rich in 1351, and the district of Glarus and the city of Zug in 1352, all these new members joining the League. In 1353 the city of <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a> also joined the League, so that so that now the old Confederation of eight cities and districts came into existence. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the League was renewed by Duke Leopold III of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, but in the battle near Sempach in 1386 his army was defeated and he himself was killed. This victory greatly strengthened the independence of the eight members of the Swiss League. The Austrians were again defeated in 1388 at N&auml;fels, during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with Glarus, which had declared its independence. In this way the freedom and independence of the eight communities were secured and a new compact made on 10 July, 1393.

<p>The success of the Confederates encouraged the inhabitants of neighboring territories in their struggles for political freedom. The city of St-Gall, which had been a free city of the empire from 1281, sought to make itself as independent as possible of the mastery of the prince-bishop. The inhabitants of Appenzell, who were subjects of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St-Gall, also did the same; they gained their freedom and overthrew the lordship of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> by success in battle. In 1411 seven of the confederated communities (Berne not taking part) formed an agreement with Appenzell, by which its was taken under the protection of the League; in 1412 a similar agreement was made for ten years with the city of St-Gall, and in 1455 these treaties were changed into the "Everlasting Compact." The inhabitants of Upper Valais, who were subjects of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14014c.htm">Sion</a> (<em>Sitten</em>), also gained for themselves a certain amount of political freedom, which they successfully defended in battle; they then formed a compact with the districts of Uri, Unterwalden, and Lucerne (1403 and 1416). The districts of Uri and Obwalden won territories south of the Alps in the Val Leventina (1403); some years later (1411) the League occupied jointly the Val d'Ossola and in 1419 bought the Countship of Bellinzona. However, in 1422, the League was defeated by the Duke of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and in 1426 it gave up its <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to the Val Leventina and the Val d'Ossola. During the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> Duke Frederick of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> was declared under the ban of the empire by Emperor Sigismund. The Swiss League, by the order of the emperor, seized the Swiss lands of the duke; Berne took the cities of Aargau; Lucerne and Z&uuml;rich took other cities and territories; the league conquered jointly other cities belonging to the Habsburgs. Thus the members of the League obtained subject lands, sometimes subject to the authority of an individual member of the League, sometimes ruled jointly by several members; this changes the former basis of the League. Count Frederick of Toggenburg, who had great possessions, had made various treaties with different members of the League. When he died without heirs in 1436, a dispute arose as to his domains, and Z&uuml;rich became involved in a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with Schwyz. Z&uuml;rich formed an alliance with the Emperor Frederick III against the other members of the League, and in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which followed (1443), Z&uuml;rich was defeated, while a general of the emperor defeated the League at Basle. In 1450 Z&uuml;rich made peace by abandoning its alliance with the emperor. Various districts that had been subject to the counts of Toggenburg fell to Schwyz, Glarus, and Appenzell. In 1460 the districts of Thurgau and Sargans were occupied by the League as common <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>.

<p>A new opponent of the Swiss Confederates now appeared in Duke Charles the Bold, of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. The Confederates formed an alliance with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and declared <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against this powerful prince, who was allied, on his side, with the Duke of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. The Swiss severely defeated Charles in the battles of Grandson and Murten in 1476. The city of Fribourg had taken part with the confederated Swiss and the two cities of <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a> and Fribourg now took possession of several cities of Vaud, while the inhabitants of Upper Valais conquered Lower Valais, that belonged to <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. In 1481 the cities of Fribourg and Solothurn (Soleure) were taken as members into the League of Confederates. The <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> War had brought the confederated districts into alliance with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and consequently their connection with the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> grew weaker and weaker. When in 1495 Emperor Maximilian sought to reorganize the empire, the Confederates were unwilling to recognize the changes. In the struggle, called the Swabian War between the Swiss Confederates and the imperial troops the Swiss were victorious. The Treaty of Basle of 1499 granted the Confederates almost complete independence from the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> by releasing them from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the imperial chamber. Later, in the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> of 1648, the political separation of Switzerland from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> was expressly declared. On account of the Swabian War, the cities of Basle and Schaffhausen joined the Confederation in 1501, and in 1513 Appenzell also was accepted as a district belonging to it, so that the Confederation now included thirteen districts. In addition the Courtship of Neuch&acirc;tel became an associate member, and the Confederation was joined as associate members by the three leagues of the Rhaetian Alps: the "Grauer Bund," the "Zehngerichtenbund (League of the Ten Jurisdictions)," and the "Gotteshausbund."

<p>Upper Valais and other spiritual and secular lordships also became associate members. There was no central organized authority over all. The individual members formed special alliances among themselves; their common affairs were discussed at the assembly of the members, which was a congress of sovereign states. In addition to the representatives of the thirteen members of the Confederation most of the associate districts of the Confederation had also the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to send representatives. Other territories were subject lands of one or several members of the Confederation, or belonged in common to the entire confederation of the thirteen districts. Geneva had formed an alliance with Fribourg and Berne for the protection of its liberties against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and dukes of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>; this made it an associate member. From this time on the Swiss Confederates took an important part in the general politics of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, especially in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The Confederates acquired new possession south of the Alps in Ticino. However, at the battle of Marignano in 1515, the Swiss troops were severely defeated, which put an end to Swiss intervention in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> politics.

<p>The inner organization of the different districts of the Confederation varied greatly. Some had a democratic organization; in others the rule of the patrician town council was aristocratic. In the course of the eighteenth century many disputes arose in the cities on account of the despotic patrician government. After the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> this state of affairs led to the interference of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and in 1798 the territories of the Confederation were occupied by French troops. After the dissolution of the oligarchic governments, the "indivisible Helvetic Republic" with a new Constitution was proclaimed. All the confederated districts and the former subject lands were incorporated in the Republic. The opposition of the original Swiss League was crushed by the French army, the Helvetic Republic was entirely dependent on <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. New quarrels constantly arose in Switzerland over the Constitution. <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, therefore, on 19 February, 1803, issued the Act of Mediation, by which Switzerland was changed into a Confederation of nineteen cantons under the protection of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The Diocese of Basle, the city of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, Ticino, and Valais were annexed by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; the Principality of Neuch&acirc;tel was given to Marshal Berthier. In 1815 the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> gave back to Switzerland the districts of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, Valais, and Ticino. Berne was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to grant freedom to its former subject lands of Aargau and Vaud, and received as <a href="../cathen/04185a.htm">compensation</a> the greater part of the territories of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Basle in the Jura; Neuch&acirc;tel was at the same time a <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> principality and a Swiss canton. The second Treaty of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> gave further districts of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> to Geneva. Thus Switzerland received its present extent of territory, and formed a confederation of twenty-two cantons, united in complete equality.

<p>The inner political development of several cantons led to disputes concerning the Constitution, especially after the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> of July 1830. Half the cantons received democratic constitutions; this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> a civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in Basle that divided the canton into two half-cantons (city of Basle and rural Basle). At the same time a movement for the revision of the Treaty of Confederation of 1815 was started by seven democratic cantons which had formed an agreement among themselves. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cantons opposed a revision because they feared that it would not only result in a reduction of cantonal sovereignty, but also lead to interference with their religious freedom. The Articles of Baden, agreed to in 1834 by several cantons, introduced Josephinism into the relation between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> and greatly impaired <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. In December 1845, the seven <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cantons, namely Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>, Zug, Fribourg, and Valais, united in a league, called the "Sonderbund (Separate League)," for the protection of their sovereignty and of their territories. The majority of the cantons decided at the Diets of August 1846 and of July 1847 that this league should be dissolved, because it was not compatible with the Treaty of Confederation of 1815. At the same time the same majority voted for a revision of the Constitution, and also voted against the continued presence of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in Switzerland. The seven <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cantons made ready for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. At the Diet held in October 1847, their representatives moved that their sovereignty and their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> be recognized, and that the question as to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> be removed from the subjects for discussion. The motion was rejected, and the protesting deputies of the seven cantons left the Diet. The civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, called the War of the Sonderbund, now broke out. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cantons were defeated, and the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> ended without much <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">bloodshed</a>. Radical governments were now forced upon the conquered cantons, but these administrations were later set aside by the popular majorities of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Conservative party. The expenses of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> to the amount of five million francs were imposed on the defeated cantons, the result of which was their <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> impairment. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were driven out and about fifty <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and religious foundations were suppressed. It was a victory of Radical <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> over the Conservative party. In 1848 Neuch&acirc;tel freed itself from <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and adopted a new republican Constitution.

<p>On 12 September, 1848, the new Constitution of the Confederation was proclaimed and put in force. It transformed Switzerland into a Confederation similar to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The individual cantons retained, indeed, their sovereignty and their separate Constitutions, but the exercise of sovereignty was limited by the federation. There was an assembly to represent the individual states called the Council of States (<em>St&auml;nderat</em>), and one to represent the entire Swiss nation called the National Council (<em>Nationalrat</em>), which formed together the legislative body of the confederation. The executive authority was in the hands of a body called the Federal Council. The cantons, however, still retained the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of levying taxes, of police supervision, of the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and religious affairs, and all legislation regarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of Switzerland also all remained cantonal institutions; they exist at the present time [1913] in Basle, Z&uuml;rich, <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a>, <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, Lausanne, Fribourg, and Neuch&acirc;tel. Foreign affairs, the army, customs, postal administration and <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a> were transferred to the federation. The Constitution was revised in 1874, and on 9 April of this year the new Constitution was accepted; with a few partial changes it is still in existence. It rests on the principles of a decided centralization as regards the army and the judiciary, and unfortunately, contains also severe articles directed against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (prohibition of houses of <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, of the founding of new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, etc.). A federal supreme court was established for the entire Confederation. In many of the cantons a strong movements began for making the cantonal constitutions more democratic, and during the last decades new constitutions have been introduced in a large number of them. The creation of a common code of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> for civil and criminal cases was transferred to the Confederation. The railways were made state <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> by the purchase of the larger railways from the companies owning them, the purchase being confirmed in 1898; in this way their administration belongs to the Confederation.
<h2>The commonwealth</h2>

<p>Switzerland forms a confederation made up of the following twenty-two cantons, three being divided into half-cantons. The cantons have sovereign authority in all matters which are not under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Confederation. These competencies, however, frequently conflict, as in matters respecting the army, sanitary officers, and police supervision of foreigners. The decisions of the Federal Government are generally executed by the cantonal Governments. The main matters under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Confederation are: Intercourse with other countries and the exclusive right to make treaties with them and to direct the foreign policy; since 1898 the entire domain of civil and criminal law, for the purpose of unifying these two codes, although, with exception of the Federal Court, the organization of the courts belongs to the cantons; the army, all legislation, and the supervision of legislative work; the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to carry out public works that benefit a considerable part of the country; further, the right of general supervision over water and forest inspection. The Confederation also established a federal polytechnic high school at Z&uuml;rich, the supervision of which belongs exclusively to the federal authorities, while all other <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are cantonal and receive in part subventions from the Federal Government. The Federal Government owns and has control of the customs, post office, telegraph and telephone, <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a> (since 1905 the <a href="../cathen/10497b.htm">monopoly</a> of the issuing banknotes has been given to the federal national bank), the manufacture and sale of powder, wholesale selling of <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">alcohol</a>. Trade inspection is also largely regulated by federal law, and the Government has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to introduce sickness and accident insurance; a law in reference to these was accepted by the nation in 1912. Since they were made state <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> the larger, standard-gauge railways have been carried on by the Federal Government. The Constitution of the Confederation guarantees freedom of worship. Notwithstanding this, the Constitution forbids the reception of <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and affiliated orders and the founding of new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, while the establishment of new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in Switzerland is made dependent on the consent of the Confederation. All these special ordinances refer only to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>The federal authorities are: (1) legislative; (2) executive; (3) judicial. (1) The legislative authority is the Federal Assembly, composed of two concurrent chambers: the National Council and the Council of States. The National Council is elected directly by the people for three years, there being a deputy for each 20,000 inhabitants, or for a fraction over 10,000 inhabitants of a canton. For this purpose Switzerland is divided into federal electoral districts. The election is direct and the ballot secret. All Swiss citizens over twenty years of age, who are not prevented by cantonal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> from exercising political <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, are entitled to vote. All citizens entitled to vote are also entitled to hold office. The Council of States consists of 44 deputies, of whom each canton appoints two, and each half-canton one. The members of the Council of States are elected, according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of each canton, either by the people of the canton, or by the cantonal council, which is the cantonal legislative body. The passage of a law requires the agreement of both the States and National Councils. These two councils unite in the Federal Assembly for certain matters, especially for the election of the executive authorities and of the members of the Federal Court, for voting upon petitions for pardon, for settling disputes as to <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> between federal authorities. The nation has the right of the referendum; when 30,000 citizens entitled to vote, or eight cantons of Switzerland, make the demand, any federal law and any generally binding federal ordinance, if not of a pressing nature, must be laid before the nation, so that the latter by a majority vote can accept or reject it. In 28 cases during the years 1874-1906 in which the referendum vote was taken, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> or the federal decision was rejected in 19 cases. The people also have an initiative in matters respecting the Federal Constitution, inasmuch as 50,000 citizens entitled to vote may petition for a change in the Constitution upon a definite point. The Federal Assembly also can present a similar demand for a change in the Constitution.

<p>(2) The executive authority is the Federal Council, which is composed of seven members, elected by the joint Federal Assembly for three years. Any citizen eligible to the National Council can be elected to the Federal Council. The president of the Federal Assembly is elected each year by the Federal Assembly, as is also the vice-president; the president cannot be re-elected for the ensuing year. The Federal Council is responsible for the exercise of its office to the Federal Assembly, yet the rejection by the chambers of a bill offered by a member of the Federal Council does not necessitate the dismissal of the respective member. The executive administration of the Confederation is divided into seven departments, each of which is under the direction of a member of the Federal Council; the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is always under the direction of the president of the Confederation; the Department of the Interior, which controls the numerous federal subventions, supervises game and fish inspections, weights and measures, and directs the sanitary inspectors, and the execution of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> representing food; the Department of Justice and Police; the Military Department; the Department of Finance and Customs; the Department of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture; the Post-Office and Railway Department. (3) The judicial authority is the Federal Court at <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a>. Up to 1912 the court consisted of nineteen members; when the number was raised to twenty-four, to which should be added nine substitute members. The federal judges are elected for six years by the Federal Assembly. The court is divided into three sections; one for appeals in the domain of public law and certain matters of <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, the second for the other appeals in <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, the third for complaints respecting the <a href="../cathen/02252b.htm">law of bankruptcy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. For criminal cases there is a criminal court of three judges and twelve assessors. The federal attorney-general is appointed by the Federal Council.

<p>The Constitutions of the Swiss cantons are in all cases democratic. However, great differences are to be found in the various cantons in regard to the cantonal Constitution, taxation, communal Government, etc. In the larger cantons the legislative body is a council elected by the people, called the Cantonal Council, or the Great Council. The members of the cantonal Governments are elected by either by this council or directly by the people. The smaller cantons have as the legislative body the cantonal assembly, composed of all the active citizens of the canton, which elects the cantonal authorities. The chief political parties of Switzerland, as represented in the Federal Assembly, especially in the chamber called the National Council, are: (1) The Radical of Progressive-Democratic party that avowedly strives after greater centralization; this principle is especially advocated by the Radicals of German-Switzerland. At times this part shows anti-Catholic tendencies, as was particularly evidenced in the War of the Sonderbund, and in the turmoil caused by the Old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> movement; during the last twenty years, however, this hostility has not been so marked. This party is the dominating one throughout the entire Confederation. (2) The Catholic-Conservative party. (3) The Liberal-Conservative, or <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> party. Both the Catholic- and Liberal-Conservative parties are Federalists, but lay stress upon the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of cantonal sovereignty. (4) The Social-Democratic party.
<h2>Ecclesiastical history</h2>

<p>There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missions were started in the territory of the present Switzerland as early as the third century, but it was not until after the Constantinian era that they made decided progress. The missionaries of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> entered the county by three main roads: by way of the valley of the Rhone to Geneva, from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> over the Great St. Bernard to Valais and into western Switzerland to the Helvetii, and over the passes of the Alps by way of the Grisons into eastern Switzerland to the Rhaetians. After the political repartition of the Roman Empire during the reign of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, the earliest Swiss <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> appeared in the course of the fourth century: in Valais the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Octodurum (<a href="../cathen/09723b.htm">Martigny</a>), the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of which was transferred in the sixth century to Sion (<em>Sitten</em>); in the southwest the Diocese of Geneva (<em>Genava</em>) was founded in the <em>Civitas Genavensium</em>, which belonged to the great territories of the Allobroges; western and central Switzerland received the Diocese of the Helvetii, that was established in the <em>Civitas Helvetiorum</em>; its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> lived now at Aventicum (<em>Avenches</em>), now at Vindonissa (<em>Windisch</em>), until at a later date, between the years 585 and 650, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was transferred to Lausanne, and the northern part of the region, that had been taken by the Alamanni, was assigned to the <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Diocese of Constance</a>. In the northwest the Diocese of Basle, the origin of which is obscure, was established in the <em>Civitas Rauracorum</em>. A part of the present Swiss Jura belonged to the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>; towards the east, in Rhaetia, the <a href="../cathen/03743b.htm">Diocese of Chur</a> (Coire) was established. The territories south of the Alps belonged in part to the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/04183a.htm">Como</a> and <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. A famous shrine was the church built over the graves of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> St. Mauritius and his companions (St. Maurice in Valais); in 515 the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> King Sigismund founded an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at this spot, the oldest <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on Swiss soil.

<p>The occupation of western Switzerland by the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundians</a>, although they were <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, led to no serious interruptions of the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. At the beginning of the sixth century King Sigismund <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>; this was quickly followed by the adoption of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundians</a>. From 534 the entire territory of the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundians</a> belonged to the Kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, as they took part in the religious development of this kingdom. The Alamanni were still <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> and when they migrated into northern and northeastern Switzerland they destroyed, along with the Roman civilization, almost the entire organization of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. After the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> subjugated the Alamanni in 496 the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> missionaries began to labor in their territories. In the sixth century the <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Diocese of Constance</a> was founded for Alamannia; it included those parts of Switzerland occupied by this people. St. Columba and St. Gall from the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Bangor labored on the shores of Lake Z&uuml;rich. When about 612 Columba went to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Gall remained behind and founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, from which developed the celebrated Abbey of St-Gall. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> was of great importance in the further spread of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> on Lake Constance. Other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were founded in eastern Switzerland, among them Pfaefers and Dissentis, and in the tenth century <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a>. In western Switzerland famous <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> were established in the territory of the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundians</a>, as St-Imier, St-Ursanne, and Romainmotier; these, however, did not appear until the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> era. As time went on the growth of religion and civilization brought rich possessions and large <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>.

<p>The great movement for the reformation of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> during the tenth century, in which Cluny led the way, reached western Switzerland and caused the founding of new and important <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, such as Payern in Vaux, St-Victor in Geneva, St-Alban in Basle, and others. Several more <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> were established in the twelfth century; among these were Muri in Schaffhausen, Fischingen at Thurgau, some <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> were also founded, as Hauterive in Fribourg, St-Urban in <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>, and Wettingen in Aargau, while the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a> and <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> established numerous <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">monastic houses</a> in various districts of Switzerland. The change in monastic life introduced in the thirteenth century by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, who settled in the cities to exercise pastoral care, extended throughout Switzerland at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. Both <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> sprang up in numerous cities, at Basle, Z&uuml;rich, <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a>, Schaffhausen, Solothurn, <a href="../cathen/03743b.htm">Chur</a>, Fribourg, <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a>, Geneva, and others. Among the knightly orders, the <a href="../cathen/07477a.htm">Knights of St. John of Jerusalem</a> had the largest number of houses, some if which were endowed with large revenues. Other orders had a few <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. There were also large numbers of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Besides the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> there were houses of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian canons</a> in Switzerland, a few of which still exist in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cantons. Thus a rich <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> sprang up in the various districts of Switzerland around the numerous religious foundations of various kinds, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and the religious institutions of the cities.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant schism</a> of the sixteenth century began in German Switzerland with the position taken by <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> in Z&uuml;rich at the same time that it appeared in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. At first the religious innovation met with but little success. On 8 April, 1524, the five districts of Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Zug, and Lucerne decided to retain the old, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> and to suppress the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> within their territories. At the Diet of the Confederation held at <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a> on 20 April of the same year this decision was adopted by all the districts excepting Z&uuml;rich and Schaffhausen. During this period <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a> made their appearance, especially in St-Gall and the Grisons, and <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptist</a> communities were established in several districts including Schaffhausen and Appenzell. A peasant revolt broke out, partly in connection with the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptist</a> movement; this outbreak, however, was mainly settled by negotiations after serfdom had been abolished. Notwithstanding the decisions of the Diet of 1524 and all efforts made by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> districts of central Switzerland, <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwinglianism</a> spread to other Swiss cities and territories. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was introduced into the city of St-Gall by Joachim von Watt (Vadianus) and his followers; in 1528 all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were excluded from the council, and only the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> remained loyal to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwinglianism</a> extended from St-Gall into Appenzell and spread among the communes of Appenzell-Ausserrhoden. Through the influence of Z&uuml;rich, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> was introduced into Toggenburg, which belonged to the Abbey of St-Gall, and into Thurgau, so that in 1525 the majority of the inhabitants of both these districts belonged to the new <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> also found entrance into Glarus, Sargans, and the valley of the Rhine, as well as into the Grisons. In these districts, however, the adherents of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> could not obtain absolute control. The cities of Basle and Schaffhausen also fell away from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>; much was done for the spread of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> at Basle by <a href="../cathen/11213a.htm">&OElig;colampadius</a>. For a considerable time Berne wavered, but in 1528 the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> urged by Francis Kolb, N. Manuel, Berchtold Haller, and Johann Haller conquered, and the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was introduced by force in all the territories of <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a>.

<p>The districts that had become <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> united both with one another and with foreign <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> cities. The five <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> districts of Switzerland, mentioned above, had also united in defense of the old Faith in their territories, and had formed an alliance with <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> now sought to force them to submit to his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> teachings. This resulted in the two <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of Kappel (1528-31), which ended in the victory of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> districts by the battle near Kappel in 1531, in which <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> was killed. In the second Peace of Kappel which was now signed (1531) the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> was completely restored in the common dependencies of <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a>, Freiamt, and Rapperswyl, and numerous <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the Thurgau; the valley of the Rhine became <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> again and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were re-established. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant Faith</a> was recognized by the Constitution; in the religiously mixed districts and in the German subject lands the individual <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> could decide to which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to belong, but the free exercise of the religion of the minority was protected; the districts which were entirely <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> or entirely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> retained their respective confessions, and the alliance of the <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwinglian</a> districts was dissolved. In the meantime the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> had been carried from <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a> into <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> Switzerland. Among the lordships belonging to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Basle in the Jura, the new <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> made its way into the M&uuml;nsterthal, Biel, the city of Neuch&acirc;tel, and also in the district of Neuch&acirc;tel. In 1536 Berne conquered the district of Vaux and introduced <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> into it by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">force</a>, as well as in the lands that <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a> owned in common with Fribourg. Berne also supported the adherents of the new <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which in 1535 had gained the supremacy in the possessions of its ally in Geneva, where <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> soon made his appearance and where he established a new center of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>.

<p>In religious matters the Confederation was now divided as follows: the five districts of Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Zug, and Lucerne with their dependencies (among them Ticino), also Fribourg, Solothurn, the allied Valais, the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St-Gall, and the common dependencies of <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a>, Freiamt, and Rapperswyl remained <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>; Z&uuml;rich, Berne with Vaud, Basle, Schaffhausen, the city of St-Gall, and Geneva were <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>; both confessions existed together in Appenzell, which in 1597 was divided into <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Innerrhoden and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Ausserrhoden, Glarus, the Grisons (where only the "graue Bund" remained <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>), and in the dependent districts of Aargau, Thurgau, Werdenberg, the valley of the Rhine, and Toggenburg. True inner religious reform, based on the pure <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, found <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> promoters in Switzerland and in the era of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> labored with great success, as did also Bishop Christopher Blarer of Basle. Of great value in this work was the summoning of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, of whom the most important was Peter Canisius; in the years succeeding 1574 they erected flourishing colleges in numerous cities, as Lucerne, Fribourg, Porrentruy, Siders, Brig, <a href="../cathen/14014c.htm">Sion</a>, and Solothurn. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> also entered Switzerland at the same time, and erected their first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on Swiss soil at Altorf in 1579; this was gradually followed by the founding of nearly thirty more houses, so that their spiritual labors embraced the larger part of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> districts of the Confederation. Another important factor in the revival of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> was the establishment of a permanent <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> nunciature to the Confederation with its seat at <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a> (from 1579). The Collegium Helveticum at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and the Collegium Germanicarum at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, both of which had a number of free scholarships for Swiss <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, did much for the thorough <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and earnest religious training of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The revival of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life was vigorously supported by <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> Schneuwly at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> statesman, such as L. Pfyffer, of <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09437c.htm">M. Lussy</a> in the forest districts that had formed the original Swiss League. The internal reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> based on the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> made its way throughout <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Switzerland to the great benefit of the loyal <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population. The seven <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> districts formed the Borromaean League in 1586 to prevent the further advance of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>.

<p>The subject lands of Bormia, Chiavenna, and Val Tellina, which had belonged to the Grisons since 1513, remained loyal to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. They were hard pressed, and the attempts to spread the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in these regions also were supported in every possible manner by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> majority in the Grisons. During the violent political disputes which raged in the Grisons during the seventeenth century a revolt broke out in Val Tellina. The <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a> James of Grossoto marched in the valley in 1620 and a large part of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> population was killed (the Valtelline Massacre). This led to a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> districts and their foreign allies, the final end of which was that the Val Tellina and the other Italian subject lands were lost to the Confederates. After the Peace of Kappel of 1531 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> districts had the majority in the Diet of the Confederation, a point of much importance in the garrisoning of the lands held in common that separated Berne and Z&uuml;rich from each other. These two powerful <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> members of the Diet sought an occasion to change this state of affairs. The suppression of a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> community in Arth, that belonged to Schwyz, gave rise to a dispute between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> districts which led two the two Villmergen <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> (1656 and 1712). The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> districts conquered in the first <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; disturbances in Toggenburg led to the second <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, in which political questions were especially prominent. This latter <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> ended in the victory of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> districts, and it was followed by a new partition of the common lordships in favor of the conquerors, as well as by the granting of complete parity to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> inhabitants of the subject lands. This treaty divided the Confederation into two distinct confessional groups.

<p>The hostility to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> shown in the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> was also evidenced in the measures adopted by the Helvetic Republic in Switzerland. By a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 1798 the possessions of all Swiss <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were declared to be national <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and a further <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> suppressed, in theory, all <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> was expelled, and foreign <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were permitted to exercise their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> only through delegates who were nominated by the Helvetic Directory. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> respecting the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> was not executed. By the Act of Mediation of 1803 the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> was returned to them, and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> could be reopened. Only the venerable Abbey of St-Gall was definitely suppressed. Part of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> lands were incorporated in the state <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the Canton of St-Gall, and part were reserved as a special fund for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the canton. After the turmoil of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleonic</a> era and after the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Diocese of Constance</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration was gradually reorganized during the period of the Restoration. By an agreement of 28 March, 1828, the Diocese of Basle was re-established, with the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> at Solothurn (Soleure). The Swiss portion of the Diocese of Geneva was united with the Diocese of Lausanne, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, whose see was Fribourg, received the title of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne and Geneva</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14014d.htm">Diocese of Sion</a> (Sitten) was left essentially as before. In 1836 <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a> erected the Vicariate Apostolic of St-Gall, which was later changed into a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. The old <a href="../cathen/03743b.htm">Diocese of Chur</a>, which continued to exist, received new boundaries by agreements made with the cantons that had formed the original League. In 1888, after long negotiations, the Canton of Ticino was released from its <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> connection with Como and <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and made a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> which was, however, untied with Basle; it is ruled by an Apostolic administrator with the rank of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p>The War of the Sonderbund greatly damaged <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests in Switzerland. Not only were the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> driven out and their flourishing <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> suppressed, but most of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cantons were also suppressed by the violent radical Governments that had come to power. Even at a later date the cantons of Thurgau, Z&uuml;rich, Solothurn, and Aargau secularized the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in their territories and confiscated the monastic possessions. During the nineteenth century some sixty monastic institutions were suppressed throughout Switzerland. In a number of the cantons a strong spirit of Josephinism became apparent, and the free exercise of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority was frequently prevented. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> minority in the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> cantons was oppressed in various ways. This was especially the case on the appearance of <a href="../cathen/11235b.htm">Old Catholicism</a> which caused a regular <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and people in some cantons, especially Berne and <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>. The opposition which sprang up in various countries to the definitions of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> also manifested itself in Switzerland, and small Old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were formed in various places. The <a href="../cathen/11235a.htm">Old Catholics</a> of Switzerland united to form the "Christian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> National Church" which received formal recognition both from the Federal Council and from the Governments of several cantons. The Governments of the Cantons of <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a> and Geneva settled renegade <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> over <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> by force; <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, parsonages, and the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> were given to these <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and their few adherents by the administrative authorities. A Christian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty for the training of Old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> was established at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a>; this faculty still continues a languishing existence.

<p>When Lachat was appointed Administrator Apostolic of Ticino, and Mermillod, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne and Geneva</a>, the authorities of the Confederation and some of the cantonal Governments began to yield somewhat in the struggle with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Many churches in the Bernese Jura and in Geneva were returned to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, frequently, though, under great material sacrifice by the latter. The Old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> movement in Switzerland, as everywhere else, began very soon to decline. Of late years the attempt has been made in different Swiss cantons to separate <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. This separation has been carried out practically in Geneva and Basle. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life has greatly developed in Switzerland notwithstanding the difficulties caused by the War of the Sonderbund and the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> caused by the Old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> movement. Among the larger <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> organizations which extend over the whole of Switzerland mention should be made of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> People's Union; this <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> unites the individual organizations into one large association, and labors with much success in the fields of religion, charity, social work, and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The section for home missions, that aids <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the <em>diaspora</em>, distributed for this purpose the sum of 202,720 francs in 1910, and helped 105 mission <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. The historical section supports the "Zeitschrift f&uuml;r schweizerische Kirchengeschichte." In addition to the People's Union mention should also be made of the "Association of Swiss <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Students," which is active in all of the Swiss <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, in several foreign ones, and in the Swiss lyceums, and which has a large membership. A matter of much importance for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life was the founding of the cantonal <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">University of Fribourg</a>.
<h2>Religious statistics</h2>

<p>Of the 3,765,002 actual inhabitants of Switzerland on December 1, 1910, 2,108,590 were <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, 1,590,792 were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 19,023 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and 46,597 belonged to other confessions or to none. A comparison of the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with that of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> at the census of 1900 shows that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have increased at a more rapid rate within the last ten years than the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. This arises mainly from the fact that the adjacent parts of the neighboring countries are all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, so that immigration almost always increases only the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> inhabitants of Switzerland belong to the following <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>: (1) Basle-Lugano; in this double <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> the Diocese of Basle includes the Cantons of Solothurn, <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>, Zug, <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a>, Aargau, Thurgau, Basle, and Schaffhausen, while the Diocese of Lugano embraces the Canton of Ticino. (2) Chur, which includes the Cantons of the Grisons, Schwyz, Uri, Unterwalden (both Obwalden and Nidwalden), Glarus, Z&uuml;rich, and, in addition, the Principality of Liechtenstein. (3) Lausanne-Geneva, which includes the Cantons of Fribourg, Vaud (with the exception of a few <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> which belong to Sion), Neuch&acirc;tel and <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>. (4) St-Gall, which includes the cantons of St-Gall, and the two half-Cantons of Appenzell. (5) Sion, which includes the Canton of Valais and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the governmental department of Aigle in the Canton of Vaud. In addition there are: the exempt episcopal Abbey of Saint-Maurice in Valais, the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of which is always the <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a>, the exempt Abbey of <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a>, the exempt <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of the Great St-Bernard, and two prefectures Apostolic in the Grisons, namely Misox-Calanca, and Rhaetia.

<p>With the exception of the Moravians and two <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in Geneva, all the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of Switzerland belong to the Evangelical Reformed Church. The great majority of these belong to the "National Churches," of which there are fifteen, which are organized according to cantons. There are numerous differences in details in the constitutions of these cantonal National Churches. Besides these there are also large independent <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> churches and Evangelical <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> of the most varied kinds. In the census the <a href="../cathen/11235a.htm">Old Catholics</a> are not counted as independent confessions, but are enumerated among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Altogether they number about 30,000 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> (more exact statistics are not obtainable). Four years ago the list of Old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> gave 56 names; in the summer half-year of 1910 the Old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> department at <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a> had three Swiss and six foreign students. In addition to the Old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the Christian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> National Church is administered by a <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national synod</a> which meets annually; besides the Old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> its membership includes delegates elected by the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. The Swiss <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are united for worship into twenty-two communities which are organized in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the Confederation for associations.
