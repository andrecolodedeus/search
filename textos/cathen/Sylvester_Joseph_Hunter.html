<h1>Sylvester Joseph Hunter</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and educator; b. at <a href="../cathen/02347a.htm">Bath</a>, 13 Sept., 1829; d. at <a href="../cathen/14309b.htm">Stonyhurst</a>, 20 June, 1896. His father, the Rev. Joseph Hunter, himself descended from a long line of English Roundheads, was a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> dissenting minister, but is better known to posterity as an antiquarian writer and <a href="../cathen/13748c.htm">Shakespeare</a> critic (see "Dict. of Nat Biogr.", s.v., Hunter, Joseph). In 1833 Joseph Hunter removed with his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> from Bath to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> to assume the function of Keeper of the Public Records, and in 1840 Sylvester Joseph Hunter entered St. Paul's School. While still a schoolboy, he was at least indirectly, brought into relations with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the conversion of two of his sisters. Having gained a scholarship at trinity College, Cambridge, he entered that <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in 1848 and, already remarkably proficient in classical literature, devoted himself mainly, if not exclusively, to the study of mathematics and physics. Graduating <a href="../cathen/01756c.htm">B.A.</a> in 1852, he was placed eighth wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos for that year. Soon after this he entered Lincoln's Inn, London, as a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> student.

<p>In 1857 he was received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the same <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (<a href="../cathen/11173a.htm">Canon Oakeley</a>) who, twelve years before, had received his two sisters. Within eight years of his graduation at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a> he had published two legal text-books ("The Suit in Equity" and "The Law of Trusteeships") which immediately attracted attention to his ability and professional attainments. His prospects at the chancery Bar were already morally assured when, in 1861, he decided to turn his back upon the world and try his <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">religious vocation</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. Entering the English Novitiate 7 September, 1861, he there passed through the regular <em>biennium</em> of probation, attended lectures in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at St. Mary's Hall, Stonyhurst, for one year, taught for two years at <a href="../cathen/14309b.htm">Stonyhurst College</a>, and thence passed on to his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at <a href="../cathen/02540a.htm">St. Beuno's</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1870. His career of inestimable usefulness to English <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> fairly began with his return, after <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, to teach the higher classes at <a href="../cathen/14309b.htm">Stonyhurst</a>. The requirements in physics and mathematics insisted upon by the University of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> at that time constituted a formidable obstacle to Stonyhurst boys whose time had been almost monopolized by their Latin and Greek studies. Father Hunter's efforts to deal with this situation resulted in an increased number of Stonyhurst students mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Honours List, as well as in two little books which he complied to assist others in the same branch of teaching. His influence was widened when, in 1875, he took up the training of <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> scholastics who were to teach in the colleges of the English Province. It was after ten years of this work that he was appointed <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of <a href="../cathen/02540a.htm">St. Beuno's</a>, where he wrote the "Outlines of Dogmatic Theology" (3 vols., 1st ed. London, 1894) by which his name is now most widely known. Other spare moments were given to conducting the "Cases of Conscience" for the <a href="../cathen/13399a.htm">Diocese of Salford</a>. During the last five years of his life, passed at <a href="../cathen/14309b.htm">Stonyhurst</a>, he began a "Short History of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>" which was unfinished at his death.
