<h1>Sylvester Maurus</h1>  

<p>Writer on <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, 31 Dec., 1619; d. in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 13 Jan., 1687. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, 21 April, 1636. After finishing his course of studies and teaching humanities at the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> of <a href="../cathen/09492a.htm">Macerata</a>, he held in the same place the chair of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> for three years, and subsequently in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for several years. Then he was promoted to the chair of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/13131a.htm">Roman College</a>, and remained in this position for a considerable number of years. For a period he was also <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the latter institution. The <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> endowment of Father Maurus was a happy combination of the speculative and the practical turn of mind. His <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was noted for its soundness and solidity; at the same time, he constantly put in practice <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> principle, "not to be more wise than it behoveth to be wise, but to be wise unto sobriety". Though he was a good <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, he was a better religious. Those well acquainted with him are convinced that he never lost his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> innocence. Neither his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> nor his learning made him a disagreeable companion or an undesirable friend. It would be hard to say whether he was more admired or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> by those who came into contact with him.

<p>The following works of Father Maurus deserve mention: (1) "Qu&aelig;stionum philosophicarum Sylvestri Mauri, Soc. Jesu, in Collegio Romano Philosophi&aelig; Professoris". This work is divided into four books, and appeared at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1658. A second edition was issued in 1670. The latest edition, in three volumes, is prefaced by a letter of <a href="../cathen/09215a.htm">Father Liberatore</a>, and appeared in <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a>, 1875-76. (2) "Aristotelis opera qu&aelig; extant omnia, brevi paraphrasi, ac litter&aelig; perpetuo inh&aelig;rente explanatione illustrata". The work appeared in six volumes, Rome, 1668. The second volume, containing <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, was edited anew in 1696-98. The whole work was published again in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1885-87, by Fathers Ehrle, Felchlin, and Beringer; this edition formed part of the collection entitled "Bibliotheca Theologi&aelig; et Philosophi&aelig; scholastic&aelig;". (3) "Qu&aelig;stionum theologicarum ll. 6", published at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1676-79; this work contains all the principal <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> treatises. (4) "Opus theologicum", published in three folio volumes at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1687, treats of all the main questions of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> accurately, concisely, and clearly. The first volume contains some information concerning the author, and also his picture engraved by Louis Lenfant.
