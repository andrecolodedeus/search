<h1>Sylvestrines</h1>  

<p>A minor monastic order or, strictly speaking, congregation following in general the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a> but distinct from the Black <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and not forming a part of the confederation of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> congregations. The Sylvestrines were founded by <a href="../cathen/14372b.htm">St. Sylvester Gozzolini</a> on Monte Fano near <a href="../cathen/05744a.htm">Fabriano</a> in 1231. The <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a> was observed in its primitive form, but in many points the founder went considerably beyond it in point of austerity, laying special stress on the strictest observance of poverty. At the death of St. Sylvester in 1267 eleven <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were under his leadership of which some had been founded by him, while others, though of older foundation, had adopted his institute. The congregation had been formally sanctioned by <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> twenty years before the founder's death. Except for a few houses in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> and the Ceylon foundation mentioned below, there have been no Sylvestrine <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> outside <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Under St. Sylvester's immediate successors in the generalship, Giuseppe della Serra Quirico (d. 1258), Blessed Bartolomeo di Cingoli (d. 1298), and Andrea Giacomo di Fabriano, the biographer of the founder, a number of houses were founded in the <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a>, <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, and Umbria. Since 1568 the congregation has possessed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Stefano del Cacco in the neighbourhood of the Pantheon; the first possession of the Sylvestrines in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Giacomo in Settimania (or alla Lungara), granted to St. Sylvester himself by the Chapter of <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>.

<p>At the present day, besides the Roman <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at San Stefano, which is the residence of the abbot-general and counts as the mother-house of the order, the Sylvestrines have <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at <a href="../cathen/05744a.htm">Fabriano</a>, Sasso Ferrato, <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, <a href="../cathen/11338a.htm">Osimo</a>, Serra San Quirico, and <a href="../cathen/05744a.htm">Matelica</a>. Since 1855 they have also had a large mission in Ceylon with its headquarters in the Abbey of Saint Antony at <a href="../cathen/08596b.htm">Kandy</a>. At the present day (1911) the congregation numbers some 100 members, of whom about 70 are choir <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; of the total about 40 are in <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>. The chief Sylvestrine <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are: the founder, St. Bonfilius, Bl. Giovanni del Bastonne, and the Bl. Giuseppe and Ugo di Serra San Quirico. The congregation is governed by an abbot-general assisted by a vicar; the head of each <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> is a prior or titular <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. These officials were formerly elected for life, they were made triennial by <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a> in 1543, but since 1690 have been elected every four years. The Constitutions are still those which were confirmed by <a href="../cathen/01295a.htm">Alexander VIII</a> in 1690 after the severance of the short-lived union between the Sylvestrine and Vallombrosan orders (1662-80). The Sylvestrine habit is similar in form to that of the Cassinese <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> but blue in colour; <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> are strictly observed and flesh meat is never eaten except in case of illness. A <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Sylvestrine <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> was founded at Serra San Quirico during the lifetime of the founder, but the only <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> now under Sylvestrine rule is that of San Benedetto in <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>. The arms of the order are three green hills on a blue ground, surmounted by a golden <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crozier</a> with two rose branches in flower at its side.
