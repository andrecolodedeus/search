<h1>Symbolism of the Fish</h1>  

<p>Among the symbols employed by the primitive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, that of the fish ranks probably first in importance. While the use of the fish in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> art as a purely decorative sign is ancient and constant, the earliest literary reference to the symbolic fish is made by <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, born about 150, who recommends his readers (<a href="../fathers/02093.htm"><em>The Pedagogue</em> III.11</a>) to have their seals engraved with a <a href="../cathen/05144b.htm">dove</a> or a fish. <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement</a> did not consider it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to give any reason for this recommendation, from which it may be safely be inferred that the meaning of both symbols was unnecessary. Indeed, from monumental sources we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the symbolic fish was familiar to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> long before the famous Alexandrian was born; in such Roman monuments as the Capella Greca and the Sacrament Chapels of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of St. Callistus, the fish was depicted as a symbol in the first decades of the second century.

<p>The symbol itself may have been suggested by the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> multiplication of the loaves and fishes or the repast of the seven Disciples, after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, on the shore of the <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Sea of Galilee</a> (<a href="../bible/joh021.htm#vrs9">John 21:9</a>), but its popularity among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> was due principally, it would seem, to the famous <a href="../cathen/01111a.htm">acrostic</a> consisting of the initial letters of five Greek words forming the word for fish (<em>Ichthys</em>), which words briefly but clearly described the character of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and His claim to the worship of believers: <em>Iesous Christos Theou Yios Soter</em>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, Saviour. (See the discourse of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a>, "Ad coetum Sanctorum" c. xviii.) It is not improbable that this <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> formula originated in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, and was intended as a protest against the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/01650b.htm">apotheosis</a> of the emperors; on a coin from <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> of the reign of <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> (81-96) this emperor is styled <em>Theou Yios</em> (<a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>).

<p>The word <em>Ichthys</em>, then, as well as the representation of a fish, held for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> a meaning of the highest significance; it was a brief profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the Redeemer of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. Believers in this mystic <em>Ichthys</em> were themselves "little fishes", according to the well-known passage of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (<a href="../fathers/0321.htm"><em>On Baptism</em> 1</a>): "we, little fishes, after the image of our <em>Ichthys</em>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, are born in the water".

<p>The association of the <em>Ichthys</em> with the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is strongly emphasized in the <a href="../cathen/01040a.htm">epitaph of Abercius</a>, the second century <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07322b.htm">Hierapolis</a> in Phrygia, and in the somewhat later epitaph of <a href="../cathen/16066b.htm">Pectorius of Autun</a>. <a href="../cathen/01040a.htm">Abercius</a> tells us on the aforesaid monument that in his journey from his <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> home to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, everywhere on the way he received as food "the Fish from the spring, the great, the pure", as well as "<a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> mixed with water, together with <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a>". Pectorius also speaks of the Fish as a delicious spiritual nurture supplied by the "Saviour of the Saints". In the Eucharistic monuments this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is expressed repeatedly in the pictorial form; the food before the banqueters is invariably bread and fish on two separate dishes. The peculiar significance attached to the fish in this relation is well brought out in such early frescoes as the <em><a href="../cathen/06165a.htm">Fractio Panis</a></em> scene in the cemetery of St. Priscilla, and the fishes on the grass, in closest proximity to the baskets containing <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of Lucina. (See <a href="../cathen/05590a.htm">S<font size=-2>YMBOLISM OF THE</font> E<font size=-2>UCHARIST</font></a>.)

<p>The fish symbol was not, however, represented exclusively with symbols of the Eucharist; quite frequently it is found associated with such other symbols as the <a href="../cathen/05144b.htm">dove</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01462a.htm">anchor</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10488a.htm">monogram of Christ</a>. The monuments, too, on which it appears, from the first to the fourth century, include frescoes, sculptured representations, rings, seals, gilded glasses, as well as enkolpia of various materials. The type of fish depicted calls for no special observation, save that, from the second century, the form of the dolphin was frequently employed. The reason for this particular selection is presumed to be the fact that, in popular esteem, the dolphin was regarded as friendly to man.

<p>Besides the Eucharistic frescoes of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> a considerable number of objects containing the fish-symbol are preserved in various <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> museums, one of the most interesting, because of the grouping of the fish with several other symbols, being a carved gem in the Kircherian Museum in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On the left is a T-form <a href="../cathen/01462a.htm">anchor</a>, with two fishes beneath the crossbar, while next in order are a T-form cross with a <a href="../cathen/05144b.htm">dove</a> on the crossbar and a sheep at the foot, another T-cross as the mast of a ship, and the good shepherd carrying on His shoulders the strayed sheep. In addition to these symbols the five letters of the word <em>Ichthys</em> are distributed round the border. Another ancient carved gem represents a ship supported by a fish, with <a href="../cathen/05144b.htm">doves</a> perched on the mast and stern, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> on the waters rescuing St. Peter.

<p>After the fourth century the symbolism of the fish gradually disappeared; representations of fishes on <a href="../cathen/02274a.htm">baptismal fonts</a> and on bronze <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> cups like those found at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, now in the Kircherian Museum, are merely of an ornamental character, suggested, probably by the water used in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.
