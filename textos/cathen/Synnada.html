<h1>Synnada</h1>  

<p>Titular <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> in Phrygia Salutaris. Synnada is said to have been founded by Acamas who went to Phrygia after the Trojan <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and took some Macedonian colonists. The consul Manlius Vulso passed through that city on his expeditions against the Galatians. It was situated in the south-eastern part of Eastern Phrygia, or Parorea, thus named because it extended to the foot of the mountains of <a href="../cathen/12116b.htm">Pisidia</a>. After having belonged to the kingdom of the Attali, it became the capital of a district of the province of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, except on two occasions during the last century of the Republic when it was temporarily attached to Cilicia. Under these two regimes Synnada was the centre of an important <em>conventus juridicus,</em> or judicial centre; it was to preside at this assembly that Cicero stopped at Synnada on his way from Ephesus to Cilicia and on his return. Although small, the city was celebrated throughout the empire on account of the trade in marble which came from the quarries of the neighbouring city of Dacimium. Under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> at the time of the creation of Phrygia Pacatiana, Synnada, at the intersection of two great roads, became the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>. On its <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>, which disappear after the reign of <a href="../cathen/06366a.htm">Gallienus</a>, its inhabitants call themselves Dorians and Ionians. Today it is the city of Schifout Kassaba, situated five hours south of Afoun Kara Hissar, vilayet of Broussa.

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was introduced at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> into Synnada. The "Martyrologium Hieronymianum" mentions several of its <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. For St. Trophimus, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by the Latin and Greek Churches on 19 Sept., see "Acta SS.", VI Sept., 9 sq. A <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> in the form of a sarcophagus containing some of the bones of this <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> has been discovered at Schifout Kassaba and transported to the museum at Broussa; this curious monument may date back to the third century [see Mendel in "Bulletin de Correspondance Hell&eacute;nique", XXXIII (1909), 342 sq.]. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.19</a>) speaks of its <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Atticus who entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> Theodore the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of instructing the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. About 230-5 a council on the rebaptizing of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> was held there (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.7</a>). St. Agapetus, mentioned in the Roman Martyrology on 24 March as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Synnada, belonged to Synaus. For a list of other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> see <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a>, "Oriens christ.", I, 827. Mention must be made of Procopius (321); Cyriacus, friend of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>; Theodosius and his competitor Agapetus, at first a <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>; Severus (431); Marinianus (448-51); Theogenes (536); Severus (553); St. Pausicacus, during the reign of Maurice, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> on 13 May; Cosmas, 680; John, adversary of the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">iconoclasts</a> in the time of Patriarch <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a>; St. Michael, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by the Latin and Greek churches 23 May, died 23 May, 826, in exile for his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in defending the worship of images; Peter under Photius; John under Photius; Pantaleon under Leo the Wise; Leo under Basil II; Nicetas in 1082; Georgios at the Council of St. Sophia, about 1450, if one can believe the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> Acts of this council, which perhaps never occurred. The last <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Synnada spoken of in the documents, without mentioning his name, probably lived under John Cantacuzenus (see "Cantacuz. Hist.", III, 73) and probably never lived at Synnada on account of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> conquest. Several years after (1385) the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was committed to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Philadelphia. In conclusion may be mentioned St. Constantine, a converted <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> of Synnada, who lived in the tenth century; he became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, and is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> 26 December.
