<h1>Synod</h1>  

<p>(Greek <em>synodos</em>, an assembly).

<p>A general term for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> gatherings under hierarchical authority, for the discussion and decision of matters relating to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, or discipline. It corresponds to the Latin word <em>concilium</em>. The word <em>synodus</em> appears probably for the first time in the so-called "Apostolic canons", while the word <em>concilium</em> was employed in the same meaning by <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> more than a century earlier. Synod and council are, therefore, synonymous terms.

<p>When the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the whole world are congregated under the presidency of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the synod is denominated ecumenical or general. It is only to such an assembly that it is lawful to apply the term <em>sancta synodus</em> (see <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">GENERAL COUNCILS</a>). If the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of an <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> meet under the headship of their <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, the council is termed provincial. When the hierarchs of all the provinces of a nation assemble, the synod is called national, or, under certain circumstances, plenary. The regulations governing provincial and plenary council are practically the same. In addition to those mentioned, there are other synods that are more difficult of classification, as synods of the East or the West, the <em>synodoi endemousai</em> of Constantinople, and the mixed councils of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and secular dignitaries who assembled together to make regulations for both spiritual and civil matters.

<p>Different from all other councils is the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod. Other councils are assemblies of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who have a definitive vote in the matters under consideration, but in a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod there is only one voter and only one lawgiver, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. This article deals mainly with <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synods. In his book "De Synodo Dioecesana" (lib. 1, c. i) <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> thus defines a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod: "A lawful assembly convoked by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, in which he gathers together the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and all others who are bound to attend it, for the purpose of doing and deliberating concerning what belongs to the pastoral care." The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIV, c. ii, "De ref.") required that a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod be held once a year. This law is still in force, but a mild interpretation, introduced by custom, has been tacitly sanctioned by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Usually, the date for holding the synod should be announced on the Feast of the Epiphany. A month before the opening the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of convocation should be affixed to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> doors, and it should be published on three successive <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches. When two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> are united under one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the synod should be celebrated alternately in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of each such diocese. It belongs to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to convoke the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod whether he be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as yet or not. An <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, however, who has not yet received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, has not the same right. <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicars-general</a> can assemble a synod only in virtue of a special mandate of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. When a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is vacant, the <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a> can and should hold a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod if a year has elapsed since the celebration of the last once. Ordinarily, the convocation of a synod should take place after the episcopal visitation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can then be better guided in forming his <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>. When, however, the visitation has been neglected for years, it is considered more advisable to hold the synod first. As the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is the only law-giver at a synod, it belongs to him to draw up the various decrees which he may wish to <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgate</a> at its sessions. While he convokes the synod by his own authority and is not required to consult his chapter concerning the convocation or its preparatory acts, yet he must ask the counsel of his chapter or <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> consultors as to the decrees he desires to enact, though he is not bound to follow their advice. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is exhorted, in the formation of his decrees, to hold private conferences with the prudent, learned, and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and then to consult his chapter on the proposed <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> thus formed (S. C. C., 26 Nov., 1689). Only in this way does the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> deliberate with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> at a synod, and though the finished decrees will receive all their authority from him, yet it is consonant with the mind of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that, in the formation of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, the opinion of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> be heard and considered. Summonses to a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod should be given to the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, the members of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, holders of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, and all others who have care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. If there is a custom to that effect, all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> may be summoned. Regulars who have care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to attend a synod. Their superiors are not, however, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to attend, unless they personally act as <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curates</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has power to punish with censures all those legitimately summoned who fail to attend. Laymen may also be invited by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to be present at a synod if there is a custom to that effect, but under no circumstances can they acquire a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to such summons.

<p>At the synod the decrees determined on by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> are <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, and a period of two months is allowed for having recourse against them to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. All the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are bound by these decrees, and it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to send his <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for revision before publication. Exempt regulars are bound to observe <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> decrees in all things which concern the sacred canons, the Constitutions of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and councils, and the decrees of the Sacred <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may not force his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to buy printed copies of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> (S. C. C., 14 Dec., 1658). During the synod the appointment is made of synodal examiners. To the former <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of these officials has been added by the "Maxima Cura" of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> (20 Aug., 1910) that of being associated with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in drawing up the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> for the administrative removal of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. By the same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Constitution, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> consultors, who are to be assessors in case of recourse against a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of removal, are also to be chosen by the synod from among the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Synodal witnesses are likewise chosen at some synods, whose main <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it is to help in the framing of deliberative questions or to report at the following synod what has been the effect of the degrees <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> at the last assembly, or to suggest new ones. Synodal judges are also to be chosen, though they are rarely now employed. Their office is to expedite such causes as may be committed to their judgment outside <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. These judges should be at least four in number in every <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and their names must be forwarded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as soon as selected. The subject-matter of the decrees framed at a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod should concern only the preservation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or discipline. Under no circumstances may such a synod define any new <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a> or decide any <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> point in dispute between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> or frame <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> contrary to the common canon law of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
