<h1>Synod of Pistoia</h1>  

<p>Held 18 to 28 September, 1786, by Scipio de&rsquo; Ricci, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12117a.htm">Pistoia and Prato</a>. It marks the most daring effort ever made to secure for <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> and allied <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> a foothold in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Peter Leopold, created Grand Duke of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> in 1763, emulated the example of his brother, <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a>, in assuming to control religious affairs in the domain. Imbued with Regalism and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> he extended a misguided <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for reform to minutest details of discipline and worship. In two instructions of 2 August, 1785, and 26 January, 1786, he sent to each of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> a series of fifty-seven "points of view of His Royal Highness" on <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a>, disciplinary, and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> matters, directing that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> be held every two years to enforce reform in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and "to restore to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> their native <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> abusively usurped by the Roman Court". Of the eighteen <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> but three convoked the synod; and of these his only partisan was Scipio de&rsquo; Ricci in whom he found a kindred spirit. Born in 1714 of an eminent <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, de&rsquo; Ricci gave early promise of worth and eminence. Made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12117a.htm">Pistoia and Prato</a>, the most populous of the <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscan</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, 19 June, 1780, he planned and energetically pursued, with the encouragement of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, the work of much-needed reform, but influenced by the times, his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> came to be marked by reckless audacity. He condemned devotion to the Sacred Heart, discouraged the use of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> and images, undervalued <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, improvised liturgy, and founded a press for <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> propaganda. On 31 July, 1786, de&rsquo; Ricci, in convoking the synod, invoked the authority of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> who had previously recommended a synod as the normal means of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> reform. With characteristic energy and prevision he prepared for the council by inviting from without his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and canonists <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> for Gallican and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> tendencies, and issued to his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> pronouncements which reflected the dominant <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the times. On 18 September, 1786, the synod was opened in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Leopold in Pistoia and continued through seven sessions until 28 September. De&rsquo; Ricci presided, and at his right sat the royal commissioner, Giuseppe Paribeni, professor at the <a href="../cathen/12112a.htm">University of Pisa</a>, and a regalist. The promoter was Pietro Tamburini, professor at the <a href="../cathen/11593a.htm">University of Pavia</a>, conspicuous for his learning and for <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> sympathies. At the opening session 234 members were present; but at the fifth session 246 attended, of whom 180 were <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, 13 canons, 12 <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, 28 simple <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, and 13 regulars. Of these many, including even the promoter, were extra-diocesans irregularly intruded by de&rsquo; Ricci because of their sympathy with his designs. Several Pistorian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were not invited while the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/12117a.htm">Prato</a>, where feeling against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was particularly strong, was all but ignored.

<p>The points proposed by the grand duke and the innovations of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> were discussed with warmth and no little acerbity. The Regalists pressed their audacity to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> extremes, and evoked protests from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> adherents. Though these objections led to some modifications, the propositions of Leopold were substantially accepted, the four Gallican Articles of the Assembly of the French Clergy of 1682 were adopted, and the reform programme of de&rsquo; Ricci carried out virtually in its entirety. The <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> opinions were strongly <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a>. Among the vagaries proposed were: the right of <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> to create matrimonial impediments; the reduction of all religious orders to one body with a common habit and no perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>; a vernacular liturgy with but one altar in a church etc. Two hundred and thirty-three members signed the acts in the final session of 28 September, when the synod adjourned intending to reconvene in the following April and September. In February, 1787, the first edition (thirty-five hundred copies) of the Acts and Decrees appeared, bearing the royal <em>imprimatur.</em> De&rsquo; Ricci, wishing the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to believe that the work was approved by his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, summoned his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to pastoral retreat in April with a view to obtaining their signatures to an acceptance of the synod. Only twenty- seven attended, and of these twenty refused to sign. Leopold meantime summoned all the <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to meet at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 22 April, 1787, to pave the way for acceptance of the Pistorian decrees at a provincial council; but the assembled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> vigorously opposed his project and after nineteen stormy sessions he dismissed the assembly and abandoned hope of the council. De&rsquo; Ricci became discredited, and, after Leopold's accession to the imperial throne in 1790, was compelled to resign his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> commissioned four <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, assisted by <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, to examine the Pistorian enactments, and deputed a congregation of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to pass judgment on them. They condemned the synod and stigmatized eighty-five of its propositions as <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> and dangerous. <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> on 28 August, 1794, dealt the death-blow to the influence of the synod and of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Auctorem Fidei".
