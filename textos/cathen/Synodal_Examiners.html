<h1>Synodal Examiners</h1>  

<p>So called because chosen in a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> prescribes at least six synodal examiners. The number twenty has been fixed upon by the Congregation of the Council as an ample sufficiency. The chief purpose of synodal examiners is to conduct competitive examinations or concursus though they may be designated to hold of other examinations. Suitable candidates for this are proposed singly, not all together, each year in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod, by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>; they must be satisfactory to the synod and meet the approval of a majority of those present, the voting being secret or public as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may determine. They should have the academic degree at least of licentiate in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> or canon law, but where <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> with such decrees are not available, others qualified, either of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> or religious <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, are eligible. Synodal examiners, once appointed, hold office till the ensuing synod, though several years have elapsed. Those chosen take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>--in the synod, if present, otherwise privately in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>--to fulfil their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> conscientiously without prejudice, favouritism, or other unworthy motive. Neglect on the part of only one to take this <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> renders null and void the concursus in which he takes part. They are admonished, moreover, not to accept presents in the discharge of their office, failing in which they become guilty of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> and are punishable accordingly. Neither the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod nor the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> personally may establish a salary however insignificant, for the fulfilment of their office.

<p>If, within a year after their appointment in synod the number of examiners, through death, resignation or other cause, fall below six, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may, with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, fill up the number; if the number six decrease after the expiration of a year, permission of the Sacred Congregation of the council is also requisite. Examiners thus chosen out of synod are termed pro-synodal. There is no positive legislation regarding the removal from office of examiners, synodal or pro-synodal. In some countries where <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> do not exist, the regulations of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> anent synodal examiners are not observed, kindred <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as far as <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> being performed by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who are styled "examiners of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>" or something similar. The Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> prescribes for the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> that these examiners, at least six in number if possible, be selected in synod. It is only with permission of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and after consultation with the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> consulters that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may choose them out of synod. In case of vacancy the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, with the advice of said consultors, may supply the deficiency. These examiners are required take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> as above and likewise to swear not to accept gifts on the occassion of examinations. Whether these examiners, thus appointed out of a synod, hold office until death or only till the convening of the synod is not determined. In many <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> these same examiners conduct the examinations for the junior <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, confessors, candidates, for orders, and the like. (Cf. Council of Trent, Sess. XXIV, c. xviii, De ref; also Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>, nos. 24. sqq.)
