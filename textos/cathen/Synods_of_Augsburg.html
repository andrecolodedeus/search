<h1>Synods of Augsburg</h1>  

<p>From the time of <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> (d. 754), especially during periods of earnest revival of religious and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life, <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were frequently convened by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and sometimes by those of individual ecclesiastical provinces. As the German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were, on the one hand, princes of the empire, and the emperor was, on the other, the superior protector of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, these <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> came to have no little importance in the general <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and political development of <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Christendom</a>. Two general imperial <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were held in <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>. The first, convened in August, 952, through the efforts of Emperor Otto the Great, provided for the reform of abuses in civil and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life. Frederick, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, presided, and three <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and twenty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> took part. Eleven canons were <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life and other matters of church discipline. A similar synod, convened by Anno, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a> (27 October, 1062), was occupied with the internal conditions of the empire and the attitude of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> towards the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of <a href="../cathen/03128c.htm">Cadalus</a>, <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> during the reign of <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> correspond as a rule with the synodal system as carried out in other parts of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. We find in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, as elsewhere in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the <em>synodi per villas</em>, convened under the influence of the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> capitularies. They were visitation-synods, held by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> assisted by the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> and the local lord or baron (<em>Gaugraf</em>). Their purpose was inquisitorial and judicial. After the time of St. Ulrich (923-973), and in close relation to the system of provincial councils, <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were held at stated times, chiefly in connection with matters of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration (legalizing of important grants and privileges, etc.) and the settlement of disputes. After the thirteenth century these <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> assumed more of a legislative character; decrees were issued regulating the lives of both <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, and church discipline was secured by the publication of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>. The earliest extant are of Bishop Friedrich (1309-31). These <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> fell into decay during the course of the fourteenth century.

<p>In consequence of decrees of the Council of Basle the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Diocese of Augsburg</a> rose again to importance, so that after the middle of the fifteenth century they were once more frequently held, as for example: by the able Bishop Peter von Schauenburg (1424-69) and his successor, Johann von Werdenburg, also by Friedrich von Zollern (1486) and Heinrich von Liechtenau (1506). The two Bishops Christopher von Stadion (1517-43) and Otto Truchsess von Waldburg (1543-73) made use of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> (1517, 1520, 1543 in Dillingen, and 1536 in Augsburg) for the purpose of checking the progress of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> through the improvement of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life. At a later period there were but few <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> assemblies of this kind; as early as 1567, the synod of that year, convened for the purpose of carrying out the reforms instituted by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, shows signs of the decline of the synod as a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> institution. The Bishops of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> were, moreover, not only the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superiors of their diocese, but after the tenth century possessed the <em>Regalia</em>, the right of holding and administering royal fiefs with concomitant <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. The right of <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a> was obtained by St. Ulrich. At a later period disputes were frequent between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civic authorities</a>, which culminated in an agreement (1389) by which the city was made practically independent of the episcopal authority. (See <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">AUGSBURG</a>.)
