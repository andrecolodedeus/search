<h1>Syon Monastery</h1>  

<p>Syon Monastery, Middlesex, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, founded in 1415 by King Henry V at his manor of Isleworth. The "Monastery of St. Saviour and St. Bridget of Syon" was the only one in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> belonging to the modified order of St. Augustine, as reformed by St. Bridget (see <a href="../cathen/02785a.htm">BRIGITTINES</a>), and comprised thirteen <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, four <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and eight lay brethren, besides sixty <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> extended for half a mile along the bank of the Thames, near Twickenham; and the chief <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the community was to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the royal founder and his near relatives and for all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> departed. <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> confirmed the foundation in 1418, and the first <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> were professed in 1420. Six years later the Regent (John, Duke of Bedford) laid the first stone of the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>; endowments and benefactions rapidly flowed in, and towards the close of the century and a quarter which elapsed between its foundation and dissolution, the annual income of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was estimated at 1730, equal in modern money to 100,000 dollars. The good observance of Syon was maintained to the last; and even Layton and Bedell, <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII's</a> servile commissioners, could find little or nothing to bring against the community. The inmates were nevertheless expelled in 1539, and the buildings seized by Henry, who <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> his fifth wife, Katherine Howard, in them for some months. The <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> retired to a house of their order in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, but in 1557, on the accession of <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a>, they returned to Syon, and the greater part of their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was restored to them. At the queen's death, however, they were once more exiled, and after various wanderings in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> settled in <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, where they still own <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> community returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1861, settling at Spettisbury, Dorsetshire (transferred to Chudleigh, Devon, in 1887). The Isleworth <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was granted by James I to the ninth Earl of Northumberland, whose descendants still hold it. The present mansion is mostly the work of <a href="../cathen/08500b.htm">Inigo Jones</a>, the ancient mulberry-trees in the garden being, it is said, the sole relic of the conventual domain.
