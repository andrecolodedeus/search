<h1>Syracuse</h1>  

<p>(Syracusensis)

<p>The Diocese of Syracuse, in the <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a>, comprises the counties of Broome, Chenango, Cortland, Madison, Oneida, Onondaga, and Oswego, and contains an area of 5626 square miles, a little more than one-ninth of the entire state. Out of a population of 609,041, about 161,000, or a little more than one-fourth, are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.
<h2>Missions among the Indians</h2>

<p>The Oneidas and the Onondagas occupied lands near the shores of the lakes which bear their names. The first chosen president of the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> was the venerable Ato-tao-ho, a famous Onondaga chief. The Onondagas were the central nation of the League, and not far from the present episcopal city, on Indian Hill, between the ravines formed by the west and middle branches of Limestone Creek in the town of Pompey, about two miles south of Manlius, was the village of Onondaga, the seat of government for the League of the Five Nations. It is probable that some of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Fathers of the Recollect reform, whom <a href="../cathen/03567a.htm">Champlain</a> obtained from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1614 to minister to the French settlers and convert the natives, visited this territory and offered up the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a> on the shores of Lakes Onondaga or Oneida, and perhaps what is now Oswego as early as 1615. <a href="../cathen/09149a.htm">Father Le Moyne, S.J.</a>, however, must be considered the real founder of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the Diocese of Syracuse. Fathers <a href="../cathen/03645a.htm">Joseph Chaumonot</a> and <a href="../cathen/04601a.htm">Claude Dablon</a> were selected to begin the work of evangelization. They said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> on the chosen site Sunday, 14 November 1654. A little bark <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was soon constructed with the assistance of the Indians. <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a> had been adopted as the patron of the mission, and it was doubtless under his patronage that this first <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> on the soil of New York was dedicated. Another <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was built for the French settlers, St. Mary's of Ganantaa (Lake Onondaga). But these first missions among the Onondagas and the Oneidas had but an ephemeral existence. The <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> were constantly incited against the French missionaries by both the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> and English in <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>. James II ascended the throne of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1685 and openly professed the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. While Duke of York (1682) he had appointed <a href="../cathen/05130a.htm">Colonel Thomas Dongan</a> Governor of the Colony of New York. <a href="../cathen/05130a.htm">Dongan</a>, an Irishman and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, presided over the first representative assembly of New York which gave us the charter of liberties. Loyal to his Faith and country alike he sought to preserve and perpetuate the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missions among the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> without strengthening French influence in the colony. For this purpose he brought over with him three <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>: Thomas Harvey, Charles Gage, and Henry Harrison. He established a Latin <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in New York and placed it in charge of these <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. He planned also to establish a settlement of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the interior of the colony, very likely somewhere within the limits of the present diocese. But when <a href="../cathen/05130a.htm">Dongan</a> fell all prospect of liberty for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship in the colony of New York disappeared, and the hope was expressed at the time of his downfall "that Papists would not henceforth come so freely to settle in the colony". Governor Bellemont of New York secured the passage of a law by the colonial legislature punishing with perpetual <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> remaining in the province or coming after 1 November 1700, and any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who escaped from his dungeon was liable to the penalty of death if he should be retaken. To harbour a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> was to incur a fine of &pound;250 and to stand in the pillory for three days. Under these circumstances the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missions were necessarily closed among the Five Nations. The mission of <a href="../cathen/11222a.htm">Ogdensburg</a>, established a little later for the Onondagas, and the Oneidas by <a href="../cathen/12075d.htm">Abb&eacute; Fran&ccedil;ois Picquet</a>, a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Sulpician, was finally abandoned in 1760, and the last chapter was closed in the story of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missions among the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>.
<h2>The Church among the whites</h2>

<p>Less than a quarter of a century after the final destruction of the missions among the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> the first white settler came to Oriskany. Gradually, a few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> followed, John Cunningham of <a href="../cathen/15241b.htm">Utica</a> being the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> of whom history makes mention. Rev. Paul McQuade who was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> in 1808 was the first missionary. He was <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Mary's church, <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>, from 1813 to 1815, and made frequent visitations to Utica. There is no record of where the first <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated in <a href="../cathen/15241b.htm">Utica</a>, but there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that it was in the home of <a href="../cathen/16033a.htm">John C. Devereux</a>, one of the pioneer <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> then (1813) a member of the board of trustees of St. Mary's church, Albany. Rev. Michael O'Gorman, a native of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Mary's church, <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>, from 1817 to 1819, was the founder of the first <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> in the Diocese of Syracuse, though not the first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. He celebrated the first public Mass in <a href="../cathen/15241b.htm">Utica</a>, in the Court House, 10 January 1819. He organized the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and it was decided to erect a church for Central and Western New York, at <a href="../cathen/15241b.htm">Utica</a>. A corporation was duly formed under the name of the "Trustees of the first Catholic Church in the Western District of New York". The first trustees were: John O'Connor of Auburn; <a href="../cathen/16033a.htm">John C. Devereux</a> and <a href="../cathen/16033b.htm">Nicholas Devereux</a> of <a href="../cathen/15241b.htm">Utica</a>; Morris Hogan of New Hartford; Oliver Western of Johnstown; Thomas McCarthy of Syracuse; John McGuire of Rochester; and Charles Carroll of Genesee River. The resident congregation did not exceed thirty. Rev. John Farnan, a native of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, appointed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, began at once the erection of St. John's church, <a href="../cathen/15241b.htm">Utica</a>, and the little <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was dedicated by Bishop Connoly, 19 August, 1821. While <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of <a href="../cathen/15241b.htm">Utica</a>, Father Farnan visited Rochester, in 1820, and celebrated the first public Mass in that city. He was the first resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to attend the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>. Among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> of that early period, might be mentioned James Lynch and Thomas McCarthy of Lynchville, now <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, N.Y. Dominick Lynch was one of the first trustees of St. Peter's church, New York, and in 1790 when the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> presented an address of congratulation to George Washington, on his election to the presidency, he was one of the four <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> who signed it.


<h2>The Diocese of Syracuse</h2>

<p>The Diocese of Syracuse was projected by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, 12 September, 1886, and Rt. Rev. Patrick Anthony Ludden, D.D., then <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Diocese of Albany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Peter's church, Troy, was nominated for the contemplated see. Father Ludden declined the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. Thereupon, considerable correspondence passed between <a href="../cathen/04395a.htm">Archbishop Corrigan</a> of New York and the Cardinal Prefect of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Sacred Congregation of the Propaganda</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Finally, the Diocese of Syracuse was erected by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, 20 November, 1886, and Father Ludden, in spite of his emphatic refusal, was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the new see, 14 December, 1886. He was born 4 February, 1836, near Castlebar, County Mayo, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 21 May, 1864, in the Grand Seminary, <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, by Bishop Bourget. He was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of the Immaculate Conception, <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>, under Bishop McCloskey, and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar general</a> under Bishops Conroy and McNeirny, and for seven years he had been <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Peter's church, Troy. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at Syracuse, 1 May, 1887, by <a href="../cathen/04395a.htm">Archbishop Corrigan</a> of New York, assisted by Bishop McQuade of Rochester, and Bishop McNeirny of <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was established, there were but 64 secular, and 10 religious priests; 46 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, and 20 mission churches; 15 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; 16 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; 2 academies; 5 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>; and 2 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. Rt. Rev. Mgr. John Grimes, D.D., was appointed coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Syracuse, with the title of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Imeria, 9 February, 1909. He was born in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 18 December, 1852, made his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies in the Grand Seminary, <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>, 19 February, 1882, by Bishop McNeirny, of <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> 16 May, 1909, in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of the Immaculate Conception, Syracuse, by Archbishop Farley of New York. <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a> church in Syracuse was the pro-cathedral until 1903. At that time, Bishop Ludden purchased with his own money, <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> adjoining St. Mary's church, which had been planned and constructed by Rev. James A. O'Hara, D.D., for many years one of the most prominent figures in Central New York. He died 26 Dec, 1889. Bishop Ludden, at his own expense, erected on the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> a new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> it 25 September, 1910.

<p>Among the pioneer <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> may be mentioned: <a href="../cathen/02191a.htm">Right Rev. David W. Bacon</a> and the Right Rev. Francis P. McFarland; Fathers William Beecham, Thomas Daly, Michael Hackett, Michael Heas, Bartholomew F. McLoghlin, Leopold Moczygemba, O.M.C., Walter J. Quarter. The prominent <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> include Francis Baumer, Ulric Burke, M.D., John Carton, <a href="../cathen/16033a.htm">John C. Devereux</a>, <a href="../cathen/16033b.htm">Nicholas Devereux</a>, Capt. David Dodge, Francis Kernan, James Lynch, John McCarthy, Thomas McCarthy, Peter McGuire, Michael McQuade, Francis Murphy, Owen O'Neil, Edward White.

<p>Their are many causes for the remarkable growth of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Central New York. It was chiefly the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> immigrants who dug the Erie Canal, which was begun 4 July, 1817, almost the exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the organization of the first church in the diocese. The salt springs of Syracuse discovered by <a href="../cathen/09149a.htm">Father Le Moyne</a>, in the missionary period, added much to the wealth of these parts and attracted many. When through tariff reduction this investment became no longer profitable, extensive cotton and woolen mills, foundries and factories of all kinds, were established. Another cause which contributed to the growth as well as to the cosmopolitan character of the people, was the coming of various nationalities at different periods. The Germans began to come in small numbers, soon after the erection of the first church (1820). According to the official records, Rev. John Lewis Wariath was placed in charge of these immigrants as early as 1837. The Italian immigration began with the construction of the West Shore Railroad in the early eighties. The Poles began to locate in the diocese about a quarter of a century ago. They have now large and flourishing <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in various parts of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The Lithuanians are, as yet, comparatively few in number. They have fine <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, a temporary church, a resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in <a href="../cathen/15241b.htm">Utica</a>, and give evidence of rapid progress. The Syrians began to come about a decade ago. They are found chiefly in Syracuse and <a href="../cathen/15241b.htm">Utica</a>. In the latter city, they have a handsome church, and a resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. They worship according to the Syro-Maronite Rite. The Slovaks began coming to the diocese only within the last few years. They are of the Latin and the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, and are found principally in Syracuse and in Binghamton. In the latter city they have a resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and a flourishing <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>.
<h2>Religious communities</h2>

<p>Another important factor in the upbuilding of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, was the work of the different <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities devoted to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and charity. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Fathers of the Order of Minor <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a> came in 1859. The mother-house of the Order of the Minor <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> is located in Syracuse. The <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> have been labouring in the diocese for more than half a century. They have a large and flourishing academy in Syracuse. Assumption Academy is the academic department for boys of the Utica Catholic Academy. The <a href="../cathen/03605a.htm">Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul</a> (Emmitsburg) for more than three-quarters of a century have laboured in <a href="../cathen/15241b.htm">Utica</a>, and for most of that time in Syracuse, caring for the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> and building up their <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, from St. Louis, Mo., have an academy for young ladies in Binghamton and have charge of many <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The Sisters of the Holy Name have an academy for young ladies at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The Sisters of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis have charge of <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> in Syracuse and <a href="../cathen/15241b.htm">Utica</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/14269a.htm">Statistics</a> for 1911 are: <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, regular 16, secular 115; <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, 75; mission churches, 34; <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 35; <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 25; <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> high schools, 4; academies, 4; <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>, 5; maternity <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, 1; <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">infant asylums</a>, 2; <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 3. In the various <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders there are: brothers, 33; sisters, 330; lay teachers, 8. The pupils in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> number 10,000.
