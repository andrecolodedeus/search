<h1>Syriac Language and Literature</h1>  

<p>Syriac is the important branch of the group of <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> languages known as Aramaic. In the time of Alexander the Great, Aramaic was the official language of all the nations from <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> to <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, from <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> to Arabian Peninsula. It was divided into two dialects: the western, used in Palestine and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, Palmyrans, and Nabateans; the eastern, spoken in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/10705a.htm">Mandeans</a>, <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaeans</a>, and the people of Upper Mesopotamia. The Syriac language, as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it from its <a href="../cathen/14408a.htm">literature</a>, did not spring from the dialect spoken in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, but from the eastern Mesopotamian dialect. When the weakened <a href="../cathen/13690a.htm">Seleucides</a> ceased to defend the Euphrates, small independent principalities were formed in that region. The most famous was the little Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> whose capital Osrhoene was the religious centre of the country. This city also became an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> centre, and even then the language of its people attained great perfection. A little later under the influence of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> it developed considerably, and eventually became the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> and literary language of all the Churches from the shores of the Mediterranean to the centre of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. The suppleness and flexibility of this dialect and its loose and variable syntax readily lent itself to the most different constructions, and offered to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> a more appropriate instrument than Greek for the expression and spread of new <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. In <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> proper and western Mesopotamia Syriac was first used simultaneously with Greek, but after the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> Greek gradually fell into disuse. The period from the middle of the fifth century to the end of the seventh was the most brilliant period of Syriac literature. The <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> invasion brought about the decadence by imposing Arabic as the official language; the latter rapidly came into general use, and Syriac was no longer spoken or understood by the people, although it was upheld as a literay language for four centuries longer, and until the present time as a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language. Nevertheless, the destruction was not complete; Syriac, or rather Aramaic, modified according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of evolution common to all languages, is still spoken in the three villages in the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, in Tour Abdin (Mesopotamia, between Nisibis and the Tigris), and in Kurdistan, especially in the neighbourhood of Ourmiah. The language of this city is even in process of becoming a literay tongue, through the efforts of the missionaries (American Prostestants and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>), who print numerous works in this dialect, Bibles, text-books, and even reviews.

<p>The works transmitted to us in the Syriac language form an essentially and almost exclusively <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> religious literature. After Latin and Greek there is none more useful to the <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegete</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical historian</a>. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of more than 150 authors who enriched it from the fourth to the thirteenth century. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and those of some eastern <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> which are of easy access possess nearly 3000 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, containing the greater part of these works. Our short list will take only the best-known authors and the most important works. Of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> literature there remain only a few short inscriptions, most of them funereal, and a letter from Maria bar Serapion, <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> of <a href="../cathen/13422a.htm">Samosata</a>, to his son, written probably in course of the third century (ed. Cureton, "Spicelegium Syr.", London, 1855). The writings of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/02293a.htm">Bardesanes</a> of the same period, with a <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> inserted in the Acts of St. Thomas, form a sort of transition between <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature. The earliest monument of the latter is the version of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> called the Peschitta (simple), which is treated elsewhere (see <a href="../cathen/15367a.htm">VERSIONS OF THE BIBLE</a>). It suffices to mention also the two oldest <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> writers, <a href="../cathen/01593c.htm">Aphraates the Persian Sage</a> (d. 350), and <a href="../cathen/05498a.htm">St. Ephraem</a>, the most brilliant of the Fathers of the Syrian Church (d. 373). Among the disciples of Ephraem was Mar Aba, the author of commentaries on the Gospels and of a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> on Job; Zenobius, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, who wrote treatises against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> and Pamphylus and a "Life of St. Ephraem"; Paulius, who possibly fell into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> after having written against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> and <a href="../cathen/13516b.htm">sceptics</a>. Abamya, a nephew of Ephraem, has been wrongly identified with Cyrillona, an unknown author who wrote in 397 a poem on the two plagues of that period, the locusts and the Huns.

<p>At the beginning of the fifth century there flourished at <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> the famous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, in which the doctrines of Theodore of Mopsuetia and Nestorius found fervent adherents. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> then was Rabbula, son of a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Kenneshrin (Chalcis). He was converted by Eusebius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that city, distributed his goods to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and embraced the ascetic life. In 412 Acacius of <a href="../cathen/01283b.htm">Aleppo</a> appointed him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>; he died in 435. After inclining to <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> he became an ardent partisan of <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a>. His severity made him formidable to his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and won for him the title "tyrant of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>". At Constantinople he delivered a discourse against Nestorius, which was translated into Syriac, as well as several of his letters. He himself translated the treatise "Of the Orthodox Faith" which Cyril addressed to him. His extant works were translated by Overbeck (Oxford, 1865). His successor was the famous Ibas, or Hiba, who favoured the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>. Mari the Persian of Rewardashir, to whom the celebrated letter of Ibas was addressed, wrote a commentary on Daniel and a controversial treatise against the Magians. He also commentated the (lost) letters of Acadius of <a href="../cathen/01429c.htm">Amida</a> (Diarbekir), an avowed <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a>, less noted for his writings than for his charity, which won him a place in the Roman Martyrology (9 April). He must not be confounded with Acacius of Melytene who joined Rabbula in his <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> against <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>, nor with Acacius of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a>, patriarch of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> (484-96), author of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> on <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and of treatises against the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>; he also translated into Persian the treatise on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Osee, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11084c.htm">Nisibis</a>, who in 496 <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of that city (ed. Guidi). About the middle of the century lived Isaac of Antioch, called the Great and regarded as a saint. His history is unknown. The Syrians have attached his name to a considerable collection of metrical <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>, but it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the works of several authors of the same name have been attributed to him.



<p>Among these are Isaac of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, a <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> of the end of the sixth century, and Isaac of <a href="../cathen/01429c.htm">Amida</a>. The last-named is the author of a poem on secular games (414) and on the taking of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (410). In the first half of the century lived Balai, <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopus</a> of <a href="../cathen/01283b.htm">Aleppo</a>, the author of numerous poems which have been preserved in part. At the death of Ibas the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> were expelled, and withdrew to the Persian Empire. Among them were Barsauma, who became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11084c.htm">Nisibis</a> and was noted for his despotism; we have six of his letters addressed to the Patriarch Acarius. He also wrote exhortations, funeral orations, and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>; Narsai joined him and was the real founder of the School of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>; he taught there for more than forty years. He was praised in most exalted terms by his co-religionists, who called him "the Tongue of the East", "the Poet of Religion", "the Harp of the Holy Ghost". The <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> nicknamed him "the Leper". He died about 502. He is said to have composed commentaries on most of the books of the Old Testment, and 360 metrical discourses. Many of them have been edited by Mingana (Mossoul, 1905). Mana, who became a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, was distinguished at <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> for his translation of the works of Theodore of Mopsuetia.

<p>Eliseus bar Kozbaye and Abraham of Beit Rabban, the successors of Narsai in the direction of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, wrote Biblical commentaries and numerous treatises against the Magians. Most of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> authors of the sixth century proceeded from this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. One of the most famous was the Patriarch Mar Aba I (540-52), a convert from <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Zoroastrianism</a>; he studied at <a href="../cathen/11084c.htm">Nisibis</a>, learned Greek at <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, and went to Constantinople; later he founded the School of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a>. He preached boldly against the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>; Khusrau I exiled him; on his return to Seleusia he was thrown into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, where he died. He is credited with a translation of Scriptures, but there is no trace of it; he wrote Biblical commentaries, <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>, and synodal letters. He also translated into Syriac the liturgy of Nestorius. Paul the Persian, very learned in profane philosophy, composed a treatise on the "Logic" of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, dedicated to King Khusrau (ed. Land), and several other didactic works, preserved in part. His namesake, Paul of <a href="../cathen/11084c.htm">Nisibis</a>, a disciple of Mar Aba, was the author of Biblical commentaries. Theodore, made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Merw in 540, wrote a commentary on the Psalms and a reply to ten questions of Sergius of Reshayna. His brother Gabriel, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Hormisdardashir, wrote controversial books against the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, and the solution of difficult Scriptural questions. To Abraham bar Kardahe, of <a href="../cathen/11084c.htm">Nisibis</a>, are attributed <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>, funeral orations, sermons, and a letter against Shisban, probably a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Magian. Another Abraham, of Kashkar, founded and governed on Mount Izla near Nisibis a famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> called the Great Convent. The rules he established in 571 have been published with those of Dadisko, his successor (588-604).

<p>The physician Joseph, the successor of Mar Aba (552-67), is spoken of as the author of an <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> correspondence attributed to the Patriarch Papa (fourth century). Joseph Houzaya of Al-Ahwaz was then teaching at <a href="../cathen/11084c.htm">Nisibis</a>; he is credited with the oldest grammatical treatise known to Syriac literature, and is regarded as the inventor of the system of punctuation in use among the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, compiled in imitation of the <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretic</a> signs, perhaps with the assistence of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of <a href="../cathen/11084c.htm">Nisibis</a>. Henana of Adiabene at the end of the sixth century drew to Nisibis a large number of disciples; his teaching caused serious dissentions in the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Church, for he abandoned the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a> to attach himself to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a>. His <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, censured by Ishoyahb I, was condemned by the Synod of Sabrisho (596). Most of his literary work consists of Biblical commentaries. They are lost, but extensive fragments are inserted in the "Garden of Delights", a twelfth-century compilation, which has preserved numerous extracts from the oldest <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetes</a>. Under the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> of Ezechiel (570-81) Barhadbeshabba, who became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Holwan, a partisan of Henana, wrote numerous controversial and <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> works and a treatise "On the Reason of the Schools" (ed. Scher, Paris, 1909), which throws light on the history of <a href="../cathen/11084c.htm">Nisibis</a>. We have the synodal letters, and twenty-two questions on the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the Patriarch Ishoyahb I of Arzon (582-95).

<p>At the end of this century the Syrians had a copious hagiographical literature, of which the oldest and most authentic portion consists of the Acts of the Martyrs of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Sapor II (see <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">PERSECUTION</a>). To these were added numerous passions, lives of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and biographies translated from the Greek, the whole forming a rich mine for the historian and the hagiographer. In this century also there were translated and were often re-written the Greek apocrypha of the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> which have come down to us in Syriac, together with some native productions, such as the teaching of Addai. The curious romance of <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a> (ed. Hoffmann) dates from the sixth century as well as the valuable chronicle of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> and the large historical compilation (ed. Land) ascribed to Zacharias the Rhetorician; it consists in part of original documents and partly of Greek sources, and is of <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> origin.

<p>While Mesopotamia and especially <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> was attached to <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>, the Western Syrians embraced the <a href="../cathen/05633a.htm">Monophysite doctrines of Eutyches</a>, propagated by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Barsauma, condemned as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451), and in this they claimed to remain faithful to the traditions of <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a> (see <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">MONOPHYSITES AND MONOPHYSITISM</a>). All their <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and polemical literature was inspired by this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, which was defended by talented writers. The foremost were <a href="../cathen/08278a.htm">James of Sarugh</a> and Philoxenes of Mabboug. The latter was born at Tabal in Mesopotamia, studied at <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> in the time of Ibas, and later ardently embraced the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> cause. Appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mabboug (Hieropolis) in 485, he went twice to Constantinople and much esteemed by the Emperor Anastasius. He presided at the council which made the famous Severus <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> (512). He was exiled by Justin and died at <a href="../cathen/06377b.htm">Gangres</a> about 523. Despite his eventful life he was one of the most prolific and elegant of Syriac writers. Of his writings we possess <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, thirteen <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> (ed. Budge, London, 1894) which constitute a treatise of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ethics, a commentary on the Gospels (preserved only in part), a treatise on the Trinity and the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> (ed. Vaschalde, Paris, 1907), some discourses, professions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, several short polemical treatises against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, and numerus letters.

<p>James and Philoxenes wrote against Stephen bar Sudaile, a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>; on his return from a journey to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> he preached <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> doctrines. Driven from <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> he withdrew to Palestine, where among the <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenistic</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> he found a fertile field for his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. None of his letters or mystical commentaries on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> remain, but he is the author of a book, "The Hidden Mysteries of the House of God", which he issued under the name of <a href="../cathen/07345b.htm">Hierotheus</a>, the pretended master of Dionysius the Areopagite. This extensive treatise was very influential in the development in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> of pseud-Dionysian literature; it was afterwards forgotten, and in the thirteenth century Barhebraeus had great difficulty in securing a copy; this copy is now in the British Museum.

<p>Among the other <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> writers of the sixth century were: Simeon of Beit Arsham, a skilful dialectician who combatted the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>. He died at Constantinople in the reign of Justinian. His letters on the propagation of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of Yemen (Himyarites) are famous. John bar Cursus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tella, expelled from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 521, died at Antioch in 538. He is the author of exhortations to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and a commentary on the Trisagion. Paul, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03183b.htm">Callinicus</a>, deposed in 519, translated into Syriac the works of Severus of Antioch. Jacob Barbuadaeus, the real founder of the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> Church, from whom it derived its name of Jacobite, died in 578. His letters and profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are preserved in Syriac translations. The lives of all these men are more or less well-known through numerous monographs which can not be enumerated here, and through the valuable historical works of <a href="../cathen/08470c.htm">John of Ephesus</a>.

<p>Sergius of Reshaina was a physician and a distinguished scholar; his friendship with the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> and the part he played at the end of his life <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be suspected of having abandoned <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> doctrines. He studied at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, where he learned Greek. In 535 he was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Ephrem, Orthodox <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and escorted Pope Agapetus to Constantinople. Here Sergius sought to expel the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> Severus of Antioch, Theodosius of Alexandria, and Anthinus, who had met there. He died there in 536. His considerable literary work consists almost entirely of Greek translations remarkable for its fidelity; his versions of the works pseudo-Areopagite greatly influenced the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of the western Syrians, and his translations of profane authors (Porphyry, <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, Galen, etc.) hold a special place in the body of Syriac translations. A number of the works of Sergius have reached us; they have been published in part; mention must also be made of Rhoudemeh of Tagrit (d. 575), who left <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and grammatical works; Moses of Aghel, translator of the works of <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">Cyril of Alexandria</a>; and the Patriarch Peter of <a href="../cathen/03183b.htm">Callinicus</a> (578-91), whose <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> writings against Damian of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15061b.htm">Tritheists</a> have reached us, together with some letters.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> the literature of the seventh century begins with Babai the Great, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Mount Izla, who governed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> during the vacancy of the patriarchal see (608-29) brought about by the hostility of Khusrau II. He composed many works; his treatise on the union of the two natures of Christ which we possess is one of the most important works of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. There are extant a <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> and a dogmatic letter by the Patriarch Ishoyahb II of Gedala (628-43). Ishoyahb III of Adiabene (648-60) was a prolific writer, and remarkable for his studied style; he composed controversial treatise, funeral orations, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, numerous <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> works, and the history of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Ishosabran. We have a collection of 104 of his letters (ed. Duval, Paris, 1904), which is important for the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">religious history</a> of this period. Ishoyahb energetically opposed Sahdona (Martyrius), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mahoze, his former friend and his companion in the embassy from Boran to the Emperor Heraclius in 630. Sahdona became converted to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. The extant portion of his numerous writings has been edited by Bedjan (Leipzig, 1902; it consists mainly of the end of a treatise in moral and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> of which the first seventeen chapters were assailed by Iahoyahb. To this period belong the two most original <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetic</a> writers, <a href="../cathen/08176a.htm">Isaac of Nineveh</a> and John of Phanek (often called John Saba); the works of the latter, many of which have been preserved, embrace all subjects relating to religious perfection. Under the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> of George (661-80) the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Enanisho composed the work entitled "Paradise"; it consists of two parts, the first a translation of the "Lausiac History" of <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a> and the "Monastic History" of Rufinus, the second a collection of apothegms from the Fathers, and questions concerning the ascetic life (ed. Bedjan, Leipzig, 1897). This work must not be confounded with the "Paradise of Orientals", which contains the lives of Eastern ascetics and compiled by Joseph Hazaya (the Seer), an austere <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, the author of numerous <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> treatises, and the warm partisan of Henana, with whom he was condemned; he lived at the beginning of the seventh century.

<p>The Jacobite writers of this period are less numerous: John I, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> 631-48, is the author of numerous <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>; and Maranta of Tagrit (d. 649) left a liturgy, and commentaries; Severus Sebokt, his contemporary, devoted himself in the celebrated <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Kenneshre on the banks of the Euphrates to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> studies; his works, which are partly preserved, exercised great influence on the following centuries. His letters deal with <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> subjects. His disciple <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> of Balad, who became patriarch (634-88), likewise devoted himself to Greek philosophy. All these names were eclipsed by another of his disciples, <a href="../cathen/08277b.htm">James of Edessa</a>, a writer as distinguished for the extent and variety of his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as for his literary talent.

<p>During the seventh century public events had created new conditions in the lands where Syriac was spoken. The end of the Roman domination in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> almost coincided with the fall of the Persian dynasty of the Sassanides, and the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> rule enforced the use of the Arabic tongue. These new conditions introduced a new character in literature, among <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>. Theological treatises were thenceforth more didactic than polemic, and <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">Biblical exegesis</a> became chiefly grammatical and philological. The eighth century began a period of decadence. Among <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> writers were Babai of Gebilta, a reformer of <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">religious music</a> in the time of the Patriarch Salibazekha (714-28); he was the author of the author of funeral orations, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, and letters, preserved in part; Bar Sahd&ecirc;, of Karka of Beit Slok, the author of an <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> and of a treatise against <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Zoroastrianism</a>, both lost; he lived in the time of the Patriarch Pethion (731-40).

<p>About the same time David of Beit Rabban wrote "The Little Paradise", a kind of monastic history from which Thomas of Marga borrowed. Abraham bar Daschandad, a disciple of Babai, was the author of a book of exhortations, <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>, letters, "The Book of Royal Way", and a commentary on the writings of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Marcus. Mar Aba II, who became patriarch at the age of 100 (741-51), wrote a commentary on the works of <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, and another on the Dialectics of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, a "Book of Military Governors", demonstrations, and letters. His compatriot, Simeon bar Tabbakh&ecirc;, treasurer of the Caliph al-Mansur, was the author of an <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>.

<p>Surinus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11084c.htm">Nisibis</a> and later of Holwan, elected patriarch in 754 and immediately deposed, is regarded as the author of a treatise against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Cyprian, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11084c.htm">Nisibis</a> (741-67), composed a commentary on the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> discourses of <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a> and a treatise on <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>. Abu Noah of Anbar, secretary of the Governor of Mosul at the end of this century, wrote a refutation of the <a href="../cathen/08692a.htm">Koran</a>, a refutation of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and a life of John of Dailam. The Patriarch Henanisho II (775-79) is the author of letters, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> for the dead, metrical <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>, and canonical questions. He was succeeded by Timotheus, whose literay work excels that of all his contemporaries.

<p>Timotheus I, a native of Hazza (near Arbelles), a disciple of Abraham bar Daschandad, became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Beit Bagash; at the death of Henanisho he was elected patriarch by intrigue and the favour of the Governor of Mosul; he quieted the rivalry and was installed in 780, dying in 823. During his <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> missions in Central <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> received powerful encouragement, and he introduced important disciplinary reforms into his church. His literary work comprises an <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> treatise entitled "Book of the Stars" (lost), two volumes of canonical questions, a controversy concerning the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a> maintained before the Caliph Al-Mahidi, a commentary on the works of <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, and about 200 letters. Sixty of these letters, the controversy, and a large proportion of the questions are extant in various <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. Through him was made the first collection of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> councils, which under the name "Synodicon Orientale" (ed. Charbot, Paris, 1903) comprises the acts of thirteen <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> convened by his predecessors from 410 to 775. It is the basis of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> canon law and the official exposition of its creed. About this time lived Theodorus bar K&ocirc;n&icirc;, the author of a book of <em>scholia</em> (ed. Scher, Paris, 1908-11), which contains <em>scholia</em> on the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, a treatise against the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> one against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, a colloquy between a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> and a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and a treatise on <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. Ishodenah (or Denahisho), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bassorah, composed an <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> (lost), and the "Book of Chastity" (ed. Chabot, Rome, 1898), which contains 150 notices of the founders of Oriental <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>.

<p>The share of the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> in the literary work of this period is far inferior to that of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>. With the exception of George, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, a disciple of <a href="../cathen/08277b.htm">James of Edessa</a> who is treated elsewhere (see <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">MONOPHYSITES AND MONOPHYSITISM</a>), the writers are of only secondary interest. Of Elias, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> (709-24), we have an apology explaining why he abandoned the Diophysite <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>; it is addressed to Leo, Diophysite <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Harran and author of controversial writings. Daniel of Salah wrote an extensive commentary on the Psalms, in three volumes; the first to have reached us in the original text and the third in an Arabic version. David bar Paulos left a grammatical work, letters, a commentary on <a href="../bible/gen010.htm">Chapter 10 of Genesis</a>, a dialogue on the addition of the words "who was crucified for us" to the Sanctus. To him are also ascribed poems which seem to belong to a later period. A celebrated author was Theophilus of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, called <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> by Bar-Hebraeus, and Chalcedonian by Michael the Syrian; this distinguished <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, who was much esteemed by the Caliph al-Madhi, died in 785. His works include <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> treatises, a history, and a Syriac version of Homer, several quotations from which have been found. About 775, Lazarus of Beit Kandasa compiled a commentary on the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, a portion of which (St. Mark, St. John, and ten <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>) is extant. George of Beelthan, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Kenneshre who became patriarch (758-90), is the author of a discourse and of some <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> (lost) and of a commentary on the Gospel of St.Matthew (partly preserved). His successor Syriacus (793-817) left a liturgy, canons, some <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>, and letters.

<p>The ninth century witnessed a renaissance in scientific and historical studies. Among the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> there was a series of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> physicians who enjoyed the favour of the caliphs of <a href="../cathen/02202c.htm">Bagdad</a>; Gabriel Boktisho (d. 828), John bar Maswai (d. 857), Honein (d. 873), and at the end of the century John bar Serapion were famous among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a> for their medical works and their translations into Syriac and Arabic of the Dioscorides, Hippocrates, Galen, and Paul of Agima. Honein was at once physician, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, historian, grammarian, and lexicographer. His disciple Isho bar Ali is the author of a voluminous lexicon (ed. Hoffmann, Kiel, 1874; Gottheil, Rome, 1910). The patriarch, Isho bar Noun (823-27), was esteemed as a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> and canonist; of his numerous works there remain juridical questions, questions of Scripture, funeral orations, and letters. Ishodad of Merw, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Haditha, about the middle of the century composed commentaries on the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a> and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testaments</a>, which are of great interest in the history of <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>. In 840 Thomas, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Marga, a former <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Beit Ab&ecirc;, wrote the history of that famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> which was located in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and fortunately he inserted therein numerous documents which would not otherwise be known to us; hence he work sheds much light on the history of the whole <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Church during a period of three centuries. It has been edited by Budge (London, 1893) and by Bedjan (Leipzig, 1901).

<p>The less numerous list of Jacobite writers of the ninth century opens with the name of Dionysius of Tell Mahre, who was elected patriarch in 815 and died in 845. He wrote an <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> in two parts, each consisting of eight books divided into chapters. It extended from 581 to 833; unfortunately it is lost but is made known to us by the copious extracts which Michael inserted in his own chronicle (see below). This work is quite different from the chronicle which Assemani incorrectly ascribes to Dionysius. The latter, which stops at the year 775, is divided into four parts. The first (ed. Eulberg, Upsala, 1851) goes as far as Constantine, and relies chiefly on <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>; the second, as far as Theodosius the Younger, mainly follows <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>; the third reproduces the second part (lost) of the history of John of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and the chronicle of Josue the Stylite (ed. Wright, London, 1882); the fourth (ed. Chalot, Paris, 1895) is the personal work of the author, probably a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Touknin in Tour Abdin. The work of Dionysius was dedicated to Iwannis (John), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dara, one of the most esteemed <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, of whom we possess a treatise on the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, one of the Resurrection, one of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and a commentary on the books of the Pseudo-Areopagite. Theodosius of Edessa, brother of the Patriarch Dionysius, executed a version of the poems of <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzus</a>. He was the close friend of a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Tagrit, Antonius, surnamed the Rhetorician, author of a treatise on rhetoric, a treatise on Providence, of panegyrics, letters, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Lazarus bar Sabtha, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02202c.htm">Bagdad</a>, deposed in 828, was the author of a liturgy and an explanation of the offices of the church. Nonnius, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/11084c.htm">Nisibis</a>, about the middle of the century wrote a controversy against Thomas of Marga and some polemical letters. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Romanus, who took the name of Theodosius when he became patriarch (887-96), compiled a medical collection (lost), a copious commentary on the book of <a href="../cathen/07345b.htm">Hierotheus</a>, and a collection of Pythagorean maxims (ed. Zotenberg, Paris, 1876). No writer of this century was so prolific as <a href="../cathen/10597a.htm">Moses bar Cephas</a> who took the name Severus when he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p>The next two centuries mark the lowest point of the period of decadence. Most of the ecclesiastical dignitaries and the rare authors who concerned themselves with learning wrote chiefly in Arabic. There was not a single Jacobite writer during the whole of the tenth century; among the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> those worthy of mention were Henanisho bar Seroshwa, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Hira at the beginning of the century; he composed Scriptural disquisitions, and a lexicon, now lost, but included almost in its entirety in that of Bar Bahlul; Elias, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Perozshabur (c. 920), wrote letters, <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>, an apology, and a collection of maxims known as "Centuries"; George, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Arbella (d. 987) is the author of a canonical collection and some <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>. To him is also attributed an interesting "Explanation of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> offices". Emmanuel bar Shahhar&eacute; (d. 980) wrote a treatise "On the six days of creation and Providence", divided into four parts and twenty-eight books; the second book is missing in all known <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. Towards the end of the century Andrew, a grammarian, composed a treatise on punctuation and some <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>. At the same period at <a href="../cathen/02202c.htm">Bagdad</a> where he taught Abu' l' Hassan, known as Bar Bahlul, compiled his famous "Lexicon", a small encyclopedia in which he collected, together with the lexicographical works of his predecessors, numerous notices on the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">Biblical exegesis</a> (ed. Duval, Paris, 1888-1901). At the end of the century John Bar Khaldon wrote the life of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Joseph Bosnaya, in which he inserted a curious treatise on <a href="../cathen/14621a.htm">mystical theology</a>. The following are the foremost <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> writers of the eleventh century. Elias of Tirhan, who became patriarch (1028-49), is famous for his treatise on grammer; he completed the canonical collection made by Timotheus, adding later decisions, and wrote legal treatises. Elias bar Shinaya, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/11084c.htm">Nisibis</a>, is the most remarkable writer of this century. Appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Beit Nouhadre in 1002, and of <a href="../cathen/11084c.htm">Nisibis</a> in 1008, he occupied the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> more than forty years and survived the Patriarch Elias. He is the author of a Syriac grammer, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, metrical <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>, letters, and a collection of canonical decisions. His most important work is his "Chronography", written in 1019; it includes a chronicle and a treatise on the calender (ed. Brooks-Chalot, Paris, 1009-10). Elias also wrote in Arabic several dogmatic and moral treatises. Abdisho bar Bahriz, who became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Arbela and Mosul in 1030, is the author of a collection of "Laws and Juridical Sentences". Among the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> were: John of Maroun (d. 1003), the author of a commentary on the <a href="../cathen/15666a.htm">Book of Wisdom</a>; and Isho bar Shoushan, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> under the name of John (1064-73). He composed a liturgy, canons, a treatise in defence of the Syrian custom of mixing salt and oil in the Eucharistic bread, four poems on the pillage of Nelitene by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> (1058), and several letters in Syriac or Arabic. At the time of his death he was engaged in collecting the works of St. Ephrem and Issac of Antioch.

<p>In the thirteenth century the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> also began to write in Arabic. Elias III Abuhalim, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/11084c.htm">Nisibis</a> and afterwards patriarch (1176-90), composed <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and wrote letters. John bar Malkon, who took the name of Ishoyahb when he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11084c.htm">Nisibis</a> (1190), is the author of a grammatical treatise. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Simeon of Shanklawa about the same period wrote a chronological treatise and a poem in enigmatic style. He is probably the author of the "Book of the Fathers", which has been ascribed to Simeon bar Sabba&ecirc; (fourth century). His disciple John bar Zoubi is chiefly known for his grammatical works.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> had able writers. John, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Harran and Mardin, wrote on the capture of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> by Zangui (1144). James bar Salibi is the most prolific writer of the century. He took the name of Dionysius when he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09636b.htm">Marash</a> in 1154; in 1166 Michael transferred him to <a href="../cathen/01429c.htm">Amida</a>, where he died in 1171. His most important work is his commentary on the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, a vast compilation in which he cites or recapitulates the <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> of the Western Syrians. Among his other writings were: a commentary on the "Centuries" of <a href="../cathen/05639b.htm">Evagrius</a>, a commentary on dialectics, letters, an abridgment of the histories of the Fathers, <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, a collection of canons, several <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> treatises, two <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, an explanation of the Mass (ed. Labourt, Paris, 1903), a voluminous treatise against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, a treatise on Providence, <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>, and of occasional verses. His commentaries and most of his other works are extant. Michael the Syrian (Michael the Great), the son of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Nelitene, was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Barasuma when he was elected patriarch (1166-99). He is the author of several <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> works, but his chief work is his "Chronicle" (ed. Chalot, Paris, 1898-1911). It is the most voluminous historical compilation transmitted to us by the Syrians; that of <a href="../cathen/02294a.htm">Bar Hebraeus</a> is generally only a faithful abridgement of it. Many earlier documents are inserted or summarized in it; the author furnishes valuable information concerning the historians who preceded him, and for his own period furnishes interesting details concerning the occupation of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> princes who occupied <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, especially Cappadocia. Michael's "Chronicle" begins with the Creation and stops with the death of Saladin (1196). Theodore bar Wahboun a disciple of Michael, who rebelled against him and had himself named patriarch by the dissatisfied <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, is the author of a liturgy.

<p>The thirteenth century marks the end of Syriac literature. Among the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> were: James (Severus) bar Shakako, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mosul (d. 1241), whose "Dialogues" are a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> course, and his "Book of Treasures" a course in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>; Aharon (John) bar Madani who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09650e.htm">Mardin</a>, Maphrian (1232), later patriarch (1252-61), and the author of numerous poems; and <a href="../cathen/02294a.htm">Maphrian Gregory bar Hebraeus</a>, a man of encyclopedic learning, whose name worthily terminates this list. Mention must be made of the book of the "Knowledge of Truth" (ed. Kayser, Leipzig, 1889), the author of which plans to assemble in one <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a>; also of the chronicle, likewise anonymous, recently discovered by Mgr Rahmani. Among the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> were Solomon, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bassora (c. 1222) whose chief work is the "Book of the Bee", an historico-theological compilation in which he inserted numerous legends (ed. Burge, Oxford, 1886); George Warda and Khamis bar Kardahe, authors of numerous <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> office. Gabriel Kamsa, author of a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> poem, and John of Mosul who wrote edifying poems, belong to the second half of the century. The history of the Patriarch Yaballaha III (1281-1318) is a very curious document; his successor Timotheus II is the author of a book on the Sacraments. Addisho bar Brika is the last writer deserving of mention. He was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11084c.htm">Nisibis</a> and died in 1318. His most useful work is his "Catalogue of writers", a sort of literary history of the East Syrians (ed. Assemani, "Bibli. Orientalis", III); he concludes with a list of his own numerous and various works: commentaries on the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a> and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testaments</a>, a work on the Life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, one against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, one on the mysteries of the Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, twelve treatises on the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. These works of his have been lost, but we possess his "Nomocanon", or methodical collection of canon law, and his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> treatise called "The Pearl" (both edited by <a href="../cathen/09538a.htm">Mai</a>, Rome, 1838), his "Rule of Ecclesiastical Judgements", a kind of code of procedure, fifty metrical <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> which form the "Book of the Paradise of Eden", and twenty-two poems on <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and wisdom. From the fourteenth century Syriac literature produced no works of value. The few authors who cultivated it showed neither talent nor originality; nevertheless useful indications concerning local history may be found in their occasional writings.

<p>The great services rendered to scholarship by translations which form a large part of Syriac literature should not be lost sight of; they include both profane and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> works. The former were chiefly Greek scientific and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works, principally those of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> and his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. It was through this intermediary that the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> became acquainted with scientific culture, and came into contact with Hellenic philosophy, so that the important part they played in the propagation of the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> had its origin in Syriac literature. The "Romance of Alexander" and that of "Kalila and Dimna" were both translated from the Pahlowi about the sixth century. A portion of the works of the most celebrated of the Greek fathers of the fourth and fifth centuries were translated into Syriac; they possess only a secondary importance where we have the original texts, but are of the greatest value when they represent lost works, as is the case with regard to the "Apology of Aristides", the festal letters of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>, the treatise of Titus of Bosra against the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, the Theophany of <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, the commentaries of <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">Cyril of Alexandria</a> on St. Luke, the works of Severus of Antioch, the commentary of <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a> on St. John and his treatise of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, the Apology of Nestorius, etc.
