<h1>Sze-Ch'wan (North-western)</h1>  

<p>Vicariate Apostolic of North-western Sze-Ch'wan</p>

<p>The mission of North-eastern Sze-ch'wan includes the territories known as Ch'wan-si and Ch'-wan-pe, the cities of Kiong-chu, Ya-y-hien, the principality of Mu-pin, and a part of the civil prefecture of Tsechu. There are 25,000,000 inhabitants, 23,000,000 are Chinese, and 1,500,000 are Barbarian Man-tse. On 17 August, 1658, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> entrusted the mission of Sze-ch'wan to Bishop Pallu, of the <a href="../cathen/14079a.htm">Society of Foreign Missions</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Vicar Apostolic on Tong-king. But neither Bishop Pallu nor his successor, Bishop de Lyonne (1699-1713), who was the first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of Sze-ch'wan, could get into the province. In 1707, Fathers de la Ballu&egrave;re and Basset, of the Society of the Foreign Missions of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and Fathers Mullener and Appiani, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Congregation of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, got into Sze-ch'wan where they found some <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who had <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> from other provinces. Father de la Ballu&egrave;re, elected <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> in 1713, died in 1715 before being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Father Mullener was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Myriopolis in 1717. Bishop Enjobert de Martillat succeeded him. He established the Institute of the Christian Virgins. The following four missionaries were elected as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, but were not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>: Fathers Lacerre, Maigrot (1752), de Raymond (1756), Kerherv&eacute; (1756). It is only from the year 1765 and the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of Bishop Pottier (1769-92) that really dates the existence of this mission. It numbered then about 4,000 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, including those of Yu-nan and Kwei-chu. Fathers Delpont and Devaux died in the jails of Pekin; Bishop de St-Martin (1784-1801), coadjutor and successor to Bishop Pottier, was banished with Father Dufresse. 40,000 <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> were christened. Bishop Dufresse (1801-15) succeeded Bishop Saint-Martin, with Bishop Frenchant as coadjutor (1802-1806). The synod of Sze-ch'wan took place and completed the organization of the mission. On 14 September, 1815, Blessed Gabriel Taurin-Dufresse, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Tabraca, was sentenced to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> and executed. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> in 1900. At the death of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Sze-ch'wan had only two missionaries, and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were everywhere <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. The awful <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> came to an end only in 1840, two years after the death of Bishop Fontana (1820-1838), whom Bishop Perocheau (1838-61) succeeded. in 1840, Yu-nan was separated from Sze-ch'wan; Kwei-chou was separated in 1846, South-eastern Sze-ch'wan in 1856, and Southern Sze-ch'wan in 1861. Bishop Pinchon, co-adjutor in 1858, succeeded Bishop Perocheau in 1861. In 1864 the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Mu-pin was burned and many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> killed. On 28 May, 1895, the buildings of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> at Chen-chu were destroyed, and the following day the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlements has a similar fate. The mission of North-western Sze-ch'wan is entrusted to the Society of the Foreign Missions of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The present <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> is the Right Rev. Marie-Julien Dunand, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1903 <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03189b.htm">Caloe</a>. He resides at Chen-tu. In 1890 the mission numbered: 1 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 27 missionaries, 39 native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 2 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> with 87 students, 413 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with 3023 pupils, 43 churches or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 38,800 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In 1910 there were 1 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 39 missionaries, 49 native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 3 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> with 110 seminarians, 340 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with 5322 pupils, 5 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> with 962 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, 105 churches or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 45,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.
