<p>(SAGIUM.)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> embracing the Department of Orne. Re-established by the Concordat of 1802, which, by adding to it some <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/02358b.htm">Bayeux</a>, Lisieux, <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a>, and Chartres, and by cutting off some districts formerly included in it, made it exactly coextensive with the department. It is suffragan to the <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Archdiocese of Rouen</a>. Mgr. Duchesne is of opinion that for the period anterior to 900 no reliance can be placed on the episcopal catalogue of S&eacute;ez, which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by certain compilations of the sixth century. This catalogue mentions Sigisbald and Saint Latuinus (Lain or Latuin) as the first two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the sec. Saint Landry, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, would be the third. Some historians say that Sigisbald had lived about 451, and Landry about 480; others, relying on a later tradition, assign Saint Latuinus to the first century and make him a missionary sent by Saint Clement. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of S&eacute;ez historically known, according to Mgr. Duchesne, is Passivus, who assisted at four councils after the year 533. As <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of S&eacute;ez the following merit mention: St. Raverennus (date uncertain), whom Mgr. Duchesne does not include in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> list; St. Aunobertus (about 689); assassinated, whose double <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a> Mgr. Duchesne assigns to the close of the seventh or the beginning of the eighth century; St. Adalhelmus (Adelin), author of a work on the life and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of St. Opportuna; Gervaise (1220-28), a <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a>, who had the confidence of Celestin III, <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>; Jean Bertaut (1607-11), who, with his fellow-student and friends, Du Perron, contributed greatly to the conversion of Henry IV, and who was esteemed for his poetical talents; for the occupation of the See of S&eacute;ez in 1813 by Guillaume Baston (1741-1825), see GUILLAUME-ANDR&#201;-REN&#201; BASTON.

<p>St. Evroul, a native of the <a href="../cathen/02358b.htm">Diocese of Bayeux</a>, founded, after 560, several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the Diocese of S&eacute;ez; one of them became the important Abbey of St-Martin-de-S&eacute;ez, which, owing to the influence of <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a>, its administrator-general, was reformed in 1636 by the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of St-Maur. Rotrou II, Count of Perche, in fulfillment of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, established in 1122, at Soligny, the Abbey of La Trappe, in favour of which <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> were issued by <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugene III</a> (1147), <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> (1173), and <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> (1203), and which was reformed in 1662 by <a href="../cathen/12639a.htm">Abbot Amand Jean le Bouthillier de Ranc&eacute;</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a> went with Dom Augustin de Lestranges, 26 April, 1791, into <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, where they founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of La Val Saint, but returned to Soligny soon after the accession of Louis XVII. Among the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Soligny were: Cardinal Jean du Bellay, who held a number of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> and resigned his abbatial dignity in 1538; the historian Dom Gervaise, superior of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> from 1696-8. On the occasion of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew (1572) Matignon, leader of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, succeeded in saving the lives of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> at Alen&#231;on. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of S&eacute;ez dates from the twelfth century; that of Alen&#231;on was begun in the fourteenth. The following <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are the object of special devotion: SS. Ravennus and Rasyphus, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in the diocese about the beginning of the third century; St. C&eacute;ronne (d. about 490), who founded two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> near Mortagne; St. Cenerius, of C&eacute;neri (d. about 669), born at <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Cenerius; St. Opportuna, sister of <a href="../cathen/03729b.htm">St. Chrodegang</a>, and her aunt, St. Lanthilda, abbesses of the two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Almen&#232;ches (end of the seventh or beginning of the eighth century); St. Evremond (d. about 720), founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Fontenay les Louvets and Montmevrey; <a href="../cathen/11340a.htm">St. Osmund</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a> (d. 1099), who as Comte de S&eacute;ez, had followed William the Conqueror into <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.

<p>The chief <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: Notre-Dame de Champs at S&eacute;ez, Notre-Dame du Vallet, Notre-Dame du Repos, near Almen&#232;ches, three very ancient shrines; Notre-Dame de Lignerolles, a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of the seventh century; Notre-Dame de Recouvrance, at Les Tourailles, dating beyond 900; Notre-Dame de Longny, established in the sixteenth century; Notre-Dame du Lignon, a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of the seventeenth century. In 1884 Mgr. Buguet, cur&eacute; of Montligeon <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, founded an expiatory <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> for the abandoned <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, since erected by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> into a <em>Prima Primaria</em> archconfraternity, which publishes six bulletins in different languages and has members in every part of the world. Notre Dame de la Chapelle Montligeon is also a place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>. The Grande Trappe of Soligny still exists in the Diocese of S&eacute;ez, which before the application of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 1901 against religious congregations had different teaching congregations of brothers, in addition to the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>. Among the congregations of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> originating in the diocese may be mentioned: the Sisters of Providence, a teaching and nursing institute founded in 1683 with mother-house at S&eacute;ez; the Sisters of Christian Education, established in 1817 by Abb&eacute; Lafosse, mother-house at Argentan, and a branch of the order at Farnborough in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, founded in 1818 by Abb&eacute; Bazin to nurse the sick in their own homes. At the close of the nineteenth century the religious congregations had in the diocese: 2 <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">infant asylums</a>, 24 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 3 workshops, 1 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the blind, 1 for the deaf and dumb, 4 boys' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 11 girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 2 refugees, 16 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 16 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> devoted to the care of the sick at home, and 1 insane asylum. At the time of the destruction of the Concordat (1905) the diocese contained 326,952 inhabitants, 45 cures, 467 succursal churches, 135 vicariates towards the support of which the State contributed.
