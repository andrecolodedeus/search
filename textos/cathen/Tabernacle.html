<h1>Tabernacle</h1>  

<p>(TABERNACULUM).

<p><em>Tabernacle</em> signified in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> sometimes a ciborium-altar, a structure resting on pillars and covered with a <a href="../cathen/02217c.htm">baldachino</a> that was set over an <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>, sometimes an <a href="../cathen/11344a.htm">ostensory or monstrance</a>, a tower-shaped vessel for preserving and exhibiting <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>; sometimes, lastly, like today, it was the name of the vessel holding the <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a>.

<p>That is, at the present <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> usage it is only the name for the receptacle or case placed upon the table of the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> or of another <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a> in which the vessels containing the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a>, <a href="../cathen/11344a.htm">monstrance</a>, <em>custodia</em>, are kept. As a rule, in <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> and <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> churches it is not set upon the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> but upon a side <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a> of a special sacramentary <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>; this is to be done both on account of the reverence due the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Holy Sacrament</a> and to avoid impeding the course of the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> in <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> functions at the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>. On the other hand it is generally to be placed upon the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches as the most befitting position ("C&aelig;rem. ep.", I, xii, No. 8; "Rit. rom.", tit. IV, i, no. 6; S.C. Episc., 10 February, 1579).

<p>A number of decisions have been given by the Sacred Congregation of Rites regarding the tabernacle. According to these, to mention the more important decisions, <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> and pictures are not to be displayed for veneration either on or before the tabernacle ("Decreta auth.", nos. 2613, 2906). Neither is it permissible to place a vase of flowers in such manner before the door of the tabernacle as to conceal it (no. 2067). The interior of the tabernacle must either be gilded or covered with white silk (no. 4035, ad 4); but the exterior is to be equipped with a mantle-like hanging, that must be either always white or is to be changed according to the <a href="../cathen/04134a.htm">colour</a> of the day; this hanging is called the <a href="../cathen/03297c.htm">canopeum</a> (no. 3520; cf. "Rit. rom., loc. cit.). A <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">benediction</a> of the tabernacle is customary but is not prescribed.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> there was no uniform <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> in regard to the place where the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> was kept. The <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> and many <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial</a> and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> held in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> require only that the <a href="../cathen/07489d.htm">Host</a> be kept in a secure, well-fastened receptacle. At the most they demand that it be put in a clean, conspicuous place. Only a few <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> designate the spot more closely, as the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">Synods</a> of Cologne (1281) and of M&uuml;nster (1279) which commanded that it was to be kept above the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a> and protected by locking with a key. In general, four main methods of preserving the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> may be distinguished in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a>:

<ul><li>in a cabinet in the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> that is connected with early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> usage; <li>in a cupboard in the wall of the choir or in a projection from one of the walls which was constructed like a tower, was called Sacrament-House, and sometimes reached up to the vaulting; <li>in a <a href="../cathen/05144b.htm">dove</a> or <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a>, surrounded by a cover or receptacle and generally surmounted by a small <a href="../cathen/02217c.htm">baldachino</a>, which hung over the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a> by a chain or cord; <li>lastly, upon the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar table</a>, either in the <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a> alone or in a receptacle similar to a tabernacle, or in a small cupboard arranged in the reredos or predella of the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>.</ul>

<p>This last method is mentioned in the "Admonitio synodalis" of the ninth century by <a href="../cathen/12719c.htm">Regino of Pr&uuml;m</a> (d. 915), later by Durandus, and in the regulations issued by the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">Synods</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> and M&uuml;nster already mentioned. Reredoses containing cupboards to hold the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to have existed as early as the fourteenth century, as, for instance, the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a> of St. Clara in the Cologne <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, although they were not numerous until the end of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval period</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> dating from 1424 in the Church of St. Martin at Landshut, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, is an example of the combination of reredos and Sacrament-House. From the sixteenth century it became gradually, although slowly, more customary to preserve the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> in a receptacle that rose above the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar table</a>. This was the case above all at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> first came into use, and in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in general, influenced largely by the good example set by <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>. The change came very slowly in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where even in the eighteenth century it was still customary in many <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> to suspend the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> over the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>, and also in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> of using the Sacrament-House was maintained in many places until after the middle of the nineteenth century, when the decision of the Sacred Congregation of Rites of 21 August, 1863, put an end to the employment of such receptacles.
