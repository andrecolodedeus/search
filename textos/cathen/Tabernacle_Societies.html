<h1>Tabernacle Societies</h1>  

<p>The Association of Perpetual Adoration of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> and of work for poor churches was founded at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> in 1848 by Anne de Mee&ucirc;s. By 1851 it had the approval of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. Within a few years a number of its members formed themselves into a religious congregation, that of the <a href="../cathen/11698b.htm">Sisters of Perpetual Adoration</a>, Mdlle de Mee&ucirc;s becoming the first superior general. In 1853 the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> became an archconfraternity for <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, but quickly spread to the nearby countries where it met similar needs and received similar privileges, and in 1863 <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> granted the mother-society at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to affiliate confraternities throughout the world, except in the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This last restriction was removed with the mother-house of the Sisters of Perpetual Adoration was transferred to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which then became the centre of the association. An archconfraternity with the same name and purpose already existing in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but founded subsequent to that of <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, was merged with the latter. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the archconfraternity were approved by the Congregation of Bishops and Regulars, 12 January, 1880, and <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 21 June, 1881, approved its transfer to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and right to affiliate; and by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 30 July, 1895, granted it the title of <em>Prima Primaria</em>.

<p>The members pledge themselves to spend an hour each month in adoration before the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> and to pay yearly dues into a fund for the benefit of poor churches. The contributions are used to purchase materials for vestments which are made by <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> members of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and given to poor churches. A great work is thus done and many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> have been benefited in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, and the mission fields. The eleventh Eucharistic Congress was held in <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> in 1898 in the church in which the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was founded, and on that occasion a glowing tribute was paid to its work. In <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> alone it has nearly 200,000 members. Special mention should be made of the association as it is maintained in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of Religious of the Sacred Heart. It was founded in the houses of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> by <a href="../cathen/07134b.htm">Rev. Mother Hardey</a>, then assistant superior general of the Society, on the occasion of her visit in 1874. She established it in connexion with the Sodality of the Children of Mary, and its marvellous growth and work for poor churches are attested by the annual reports issued by each house. <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> is the centre of the Archconfraternity of Perpetual Adoration and work for Tabernacles, founded there in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> in 1846 and with affiliations in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/01311a.htm">Algiers</a>. It was approved by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1856 and made a confraternity in 1858.
