<h1>Tadeusz Kosciuszko</h1>  

<p>Polish patriot and soldier, b. near Novogrudok, <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, 12 February, 1746; d. at Solothurn, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, 15 October, 1817. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the military <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a> and Versailles, and attained the rank of captain in the Polish army. When the American Revolution broke out he embarked for the scene of conflict and, joining Washington's army, received a commission as officer of engineers, 18 October, 1776. He served with distinction through the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, was made a brigadier general, and was voted the thanks of Congress. He then returned to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> and lived for several years in retirement. In 1789, when the Polish army was reorganized, he was appointed a major-general and fought gallantly under Prince Poniatowski against the Russians. At the second partition of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, he resigned his commission and went to live in <a href="../cathen/09138b.htm">Leipzig</a>. He headed the abortive revolution of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> in 1794, and was wounded and captured by the Russians at the battle of Maciejowice, 10 October. Imprisoned for two years, he was liberated by Emperor Paul on parole and with many marks of esteem. Thereafter his life was passed in retirement. In 1797 he revisited the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, receiving everywhere great honor and distinction. Congress voted him a grant of land and an addition to his pension. On his return to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> he took up his residence near <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, spending his time in agricultural pursuits. In 1806 <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> wished him to join in the invasion of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, but he felt bound by his parole to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and refused. He went to live in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> in 1816, making his home at Solothurn, where he was killed by a fall from a horse. His remains, by direction of the Emperor Alexander, were taken to Krakow, where they were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> with solemn pomp in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> near the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of Poniatowski and <a href="../cathen/14061c.htm">Sobieski</a>. A mound 150 feet high, made of earth taken from every battle-field in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, was piled up in his honor in the outskirts of the city.
