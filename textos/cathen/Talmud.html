<h1>Talmud</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Definition</h2>

<p><em>Talmud</em> was a post-Biblical substantive formation of <em>Pi'el</em> ("to teach"), and originally signified "doctrine" or "study". In a special sense, however, it meant the justification and explanation of religious and legal norms or <em>Halakhoth</em> ("conduct", signifying "the law in accordance with which the conduct of life is to be regulated"). When in the third century the Halakhoth collection of Jehuda I or the recorded Mishna became the chief object of study, the expression "Talmud" was applied chiefly to the discussions and explanations of the Mishna. Finally, it became the general designation for the Mishna itself and the collection of discussions concerned with it. For the latter the designation Gemara, interpreted as "completion" from the Hebrew and Aramaic words meaning "to complete", subsequently became the accepted term. The word first found entrance into the Talmud editions through <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> censorship; <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and the old printed editions use the expression <em>Talmud.</em> We therefore understand by Talmud a compilation consisting of the <em>Mishna</em>, i.e. the codification of Jewish religious and legal norms, and of the <em>Gemara</em>, or the collection of discussions and explanations concerning the Mishna.
<h2 id="section2">Origin of the Talmud</h2>

<p>Since Esdras the foundation of the Jewish <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community was the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Everything was regulated in accordance with fixed norms; nothing could be added or changed in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> laid down in the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>. Yet the ever-varying conditions of life called for new ordinances, and these were decreed in accordance with the needs of the time and the special cases to be determined. There were thus formed a traditional law and custom orally transmitted. Every <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of this kind (<em>halakha</em>), if it had existed from time immemorial and nothing further could be said in regard to its origin, was called a law given to Moses on <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a>. Even for <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> of today it is an <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a> that Moses, at the same time that he received the written law recorded in the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>, also received detailed explanations of the different <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which were handed down by tradition as oral law. In addition to this the scribes at an early period attempted, by interpretation of the Torah, to make the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> applicable to the changed conditions of life, to base the new <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> at least retrospectively on the Torah, and to draw out of it further religious <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. For this kind of Scriptural learning hermeneutic rules (<em>Middoth</em>) were at a later period established, at first seven, which were then divided into fourteen, and finally increased to thirty-two. All the older additions to the Torah as well as the constantly increasing new material were for a long time transmitted orally, and, according to the prevailing view, it was forbidden to record it in writing. But it is at all events wrong to assume that there was a formal prohibition to record Halakhoth in writing. The prohibition probably referred to written records intended for public use; for a fixed record of the traditional law would have acted as a hindrance to its further development in accordance with the existing needs of the day. It is by no means improbable that the final reduction of the Mishna was preceded by previous written records, especially after Rabbi Agiba, at the beginning of the second century, had divested the study of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of its previous Midrash character and had undertaken to arrange the materials systematically. Among his pupils it was probably Rabbi Me'ir who continued these systematic labours. But of such collections only one finally attained canonical recognition, and therefore was called Mishna <em>par excellence</em>, viz. the one edited about the end of the second century of our era by Rabbi Jehuda I, called <em>Ha-nashi</em> (the prince) or <em>Ha-gadosh</em> (the saint) or simply the Rabbi. This then is our Mishna, the basis of the Talmud.

<p>Rabbi Jehuda had adopted only a part of the doctrines, which in course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> had been handed down in the different <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Although he selected what was most important, he sometimes omitted much that seemed important to others; and, on the other hand, it was felt that even the unimportant should not be allowed to sink into oblivion. In consequence, other collections soon originated, which, though not canonical, were nevertheless highly valued. All the Halakhoth which were not included in the Mishna of Jehuda received the name <em>Baraithoth</em> (sing. <em>Baraitha</em>, "omitted <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>"). The most important Baraitha collection is the <a href="../cathen/14788a.htm">Tosephta</a>.

<p>The precise brevity of expression and the pregnant form in which the Mishna had codified the Halakhoth made an interpretation of them <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, while the casuistic features of the work were a stimulus to further casuistic development. In the profound study and explanation of its contents much weight was placed upon the Haggada, i.e. the doctrines not included in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> (folklore, legends, historic recollections, ethics and didactics, etc.), of which Jehuda, who aimed to draw up a code of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> had taken little or no account. Everything, in fact, that tradition offered was brought within the range of discussion. In order to give a suitable designation to the new tendency in the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, scholars, up to the time of the final transcription of the Mishna, were known as <em>Tanna'im</em> (sing <em>Tanna</em>, "teacher"), those who came after them, <em>Amora'im</em> (sing. <em>Amora</em>, "speaker"). The collection of the Amora'im, as finally recorded, was called, as stated above, Talmud, later Gemara: that of the Palestinian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, the Palestinian Gemara, that of the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> Gemara. The combined edition of the Mishna and Gemara, or the Talmud in our sense of the word, discriminates, therefore, between Mishna and Palestinian Gemara, or "Palestinian Talmud", and Mishna and <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> Gemara or "Babylonian Talmud". The latter is meant when the Talmud without further specification is referred to.


<h2 id="section3">The Mishna</h2>

<p>(From the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> meaning "repetition", translated by the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> <em>deuterosis</em>). The word is a substantive formation from the Hebrew root meaning "to repeat". From this meaning was developed, in the language of the later <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, the characteristic method of all teaching and learning, particularly of doctrines orally transmitted, which was accomplished by repeated enunciation on the part of the teacher and frequent repetition on the part of the pupil. Both expressions thus became a term for the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of tradition, the former signifying the special study of orally transmitted law, the latter the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> itself in contrast to the first one meaning the written law. But the expression is also used for each of the doctrines orally transmitted, and differs from Halakha in that the latter signifies the traditional law so far as it is binding, while the former designates it as an object of study. Furthermore, the word Mishna is applied to the systematic collection of such doctrines, and finally to that collection which alone has attained canonical recognition, i.e. the collection of Jehuda I. This collection represents Jewish law codified in that development which it received in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Palestine up to the end of the second century after Christ. Through it the orally transmitted law was finally established along with the written law or the Torah. The foundation of this collection is formed by the collections which already existed before Jehuda, particularly that of Rabbi Me'ir. The Mishna does not pretend to be a collection of sources of the Halakha, but merely to teach it. Whether its fixation in writing was the work of Jehuda himself or took place after him is a debated point; but the former is the more probable theory. The only question then is how much of it he wrote; in the extended form which it now presents it could not have been written by him alone. It has evidently received additions in course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, and in other respects also the text has been altered.

<p>As regards the subject matter the Mishna is divided into six institutes or <em>Sedarim</em>; for this reason <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> are accustomed to call the Talmud <em>Shas.</em> Each Seder has a number (7-12) of treatises; these are divided into chapters or <em>Peraqim</em>, and each chapter into <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>. The six institutes and their treatises are as follows:

<h3 id="D">Seder Nezigin (damages)</h3>

<p>The treatises 1-3, Baba Kamma (the first gate), Baba meci'a (the middle gate), and Baba bathra (the last gate), originally formed a single treatise, the subdivision of which was <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by its great length (30 chaps.). They treat of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, inheritance, and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>.

<p>Treats in twelve treatises of the ordinances of cleanness and of purifications. (l) Kelim (vessels), treats of the conditions under which domestic utensils, garments, etc., become unclean. (2) Ohaloth (tents) of the defilement of dwellings by a corpse (<a href="../bible/num019.htm#vrs14">Numbers 19:14 sq.</a>). (3) Nega'im (<a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>).

(11) Yadayim (hands), treats of the ritual uncleanness of the hands and their purification. (12) 'Uqcin (stalks) of fruits and shells and their ritual uncleanness.

<p>In our editions the number of treatises is sixty-three; originally there were only sixty, because the four paragraphs of the treatise Baba kamma, Baba bathra, Baba meci'a, likewise Sanhedrin and Makkoth, formed only one treatise. The Mishna exists in three recensions: in the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of editions of the separate Mishna, in the Palestinian Talmud in which the commentaries of the Amora'im follow short passages of the Mishna, and in the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> Talmud, in which the Gemara is appended to an entire chapter of the Mishna. The contents of the Mishna, aside from the treatises Aboth and Middoth, are with few exceptions Halakhic. The language, the so-called Mishna Hebrew or New Hebrew, is a fairly pure Hebrew, not without <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of a living development &#151; enriched by words borrowed from Greek and Latin and certain newly-created technical expressions, which seem partly developed as imitations of Roman legal formulas. The Mishna is cited by giving the treatise, chapter, and precept, e.g. 'Berakh, i, 1.

<p>Among the commentators of the whole Mishna the following deserve special mention: <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Maimonides</a>, the Hebrew translation of whose Arabic original is printed in most edition of the Mishna; Obadia di Bertinoro (d. 1510), Jom Tob Lippmann Heller (d. 1654), Jisrael Lipschutz (his Mishna with Commentary in 6 vols., K&ouml;nigsberg, 1830-50).

<p>The first edition of the complete Mishna was at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> in 1492. Texts with Hebrew commentaries exist in great numbers. Of importance as a Conformation of the Palestinian version is the edition of W. H. Lowe (Cambridge, 1883), after the Cambridge <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>. Also deserving of mention are: "Misna . . . Latinitate donavit G. Lurenhusius" (text, Latin translation, notes, Latin translation of <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Maimonides</a> and Obadia, 6 vols., Amsterdam, 1698-1703); "Mishnajoth", with punctuation and German translation in Hebrew letters, begun by Sammter (Berlin, 1887 &#151; still incomplete); Ger. tr. of the Mishna by Rabe (6 parts, Onolzbach, 1760-63).
<h2 id="section4">The Palestinian Talmud</h2>

<p>On the basic of the Mishna, juridical discussions were continued, at first in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Palestine, particularly at <a href="../cathen/14716a.htm">Tiberias</a>, in the third and fourth centuries. Through the final codification of the material thus collected, there arose in the second half of the fourth century the so-called <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, more properly Palestinian, Talmud. The usual opinion, which originated with <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Maimonides</a>, that its author was Rabbi Jochanan, who lived in the third century is untenable because of the names of the later scholars which occur in it. In the Palestinian Talmud the text of the Mishna is taken sentence by sentence, and explained with increasingly casuistic acumen. The Baraithoth, i.e. the maxims of the Torah not found in the Mishna, as well as the legal paragraphs are always given in Hebrew, and so are most of the appended elucidations; the remainder is written in a West Aramaic dialect (G. Dalman, "Grammatik des judisch-Palastinischen Aramaisch", Leipzig, 1905). Along with the Halakha it contains rich Haggadic material. Whether the Palestinian Talmud ever included the entire Mishna is a matter of dispute. The only parts preserved are the commentaries on the first four Sedarim (with the exception of several chapters and the treatises Eduyyoth and Aboth) and on the three first divisions of the treatise Nidda in the sixth Seder. The supposed discovery by S. Friedl&auml;nder of treatises on the fifth Seder is based upon a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> (cf. "Theologische Literaturzeitung", 1908, col. 513 sq., and "Zeitschr. d. Deutsch. Morgenlandisch. Gesellsch.", LXII, 184). The Palestinian Talmud is generally cited by giving the treatise, chapter, page, and column after the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> and Cracow editions, mostly also the line, indicated by <em>j</em> (=jerus.) or pal.; e.g. pal. Makkoth, 2 Bl. 31d 56. Many scholars cite in the same manner as for the Mishna, but this is not to be recommended.

<p>Editions: <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> (Bomberg), 1523-24; Cracow, 1609; Krotoshin, 1866; Zhitomir, 1860-67; Piotrkow, 1900-02. French translation by M. Schwab, 11 vols., Paris, 1879-80;  I2 1890.

<p>Several treatises are printed with Latin translations in Ugolini, "Thesaurus antiquitatum sacrarum", vols. XVII-XXX, Venice, 1755-65; Wunsche, "Der palastinische Talmud in seinen haggadischen Bestandteilen ins Deutsche &uuml;bersetzt" (Zurich, 1880).
<h2 id="section5">Babylonian Talmud</h2>

<p>The Mishna is said to have been brought to Babylon by Aba Areka, generally called Rab (d. 247), a pupil of Rabbi Jehuda. In the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> there it became a norm of legal <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> and a basis of juridical discussion. But while in Palestine there was a greater tendency to preserve and propagate what had been handed down, the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> Amora'im developed their interpretation of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in all directions, which explains why the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> Talmud acquired a greater significance for <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> than the Palestinian. Thus the material grew rapidly and gradually led to a codification, which was undertaken by R. Ashi (d. 427), head of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/14343a.htm">Sura</a>, and by R. Abina or Rabbina (d. 499), the last of the Amora im. The scholars who lived after him (at the end of the fifth and in the first half of the sixth centuries), called <em>Sabora im</em> ("those who reflect, examine", because they weighed and also completed what had been written by the Amora'im), are to be regarded as those who really completed the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> Talmud.

<p>Like the Palestinian, the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> Talmud does not include the entire Mishna. In the first and sixth divisions only the treatises Berakhoth and Nidda are considered; in the second division Shegalim is omitted, in the fourth Eduyyoth and Aboth, in the fifth Middoth, Ginnim, and half of Tamid. It is indeed questionable if the greater number of these treatises were included in the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> Gemara; Eduyyoth and Aboth are excluded, by reason of the subject matter, while the remainder treat for the most part ordinances which could not be applied outside of Palestine. The <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> Talmud therefore includes only 36 1/2 treatises, but is at least four times the extent of the Palestinian, although the latter deals with 39 treatises. The Haggada is even more fully represented than in the Palestinian. The language, excepting the legal paragraphs and the quotations of the older scholars and Palestinian rabbis, is that of the East Aramaic dialect of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a> (cf. Levias, "A Grammar of the Aramaic Idiom contained in the Babylonian Talmud", <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, 1900; M.L. Margolis, "Grammatik des babylonischen Talmuds", Munich, 1910). The <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> Talmud is cited according to treatise, folio, and page, as the content in nearly all the editions since that of the third Bomberg one (1548) is the same, e.g. Berakh 22a. In these editions there are usually appended at the end of the fourth Seder seven small treatises, partly from Talmudic, partly from post-Talmudic times, among which is the post-Talmudic treatise Sopherim (directions for the writer and public reader of the Torah). Among the commentaries the first place belongs to that of Rashi (d. 1105), completed by his grandson Samuel ben Me'ir (d. about 1174). Chiefly of a supplementary character are the works of the Tosaphists or authors of the <em>Tosaphoth</em> (additions), who lived in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. They give amplifications and learned explanations of certain treatises. Other commentaries are enumerated by Strack, op. cit. infra, 149-51.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> Talmud has often been printed but until the present time a critical edition has remained a desideratum. Material for this purpose is furnished by Raphael Rabbinovicz, among others, in his "Variae lectiones in Mischnam et in Talm. Babyl.", etc. (15 vols., Munich, 1868-86); Vol. XVI was edited by Ehrentreu (Przemysl, 1897). Serious mutilations and bungling changes in the text were caused by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> censorship, at first in the Basle edition (1578-81). The numerous bickerings among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had the further consequence that they themselves practised censorship. The excised passages were partly collected in small treatises, published for the most part anonymously.
<h2>Editions</h2>

<p>Raphael Rabbinovicz, (<em>Ma'amar al hadpasath ha-talmud</em> &#151; <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 1877), a critical review of the editions of the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> Talmud, as a whole or in part since 1484. The first complete edition appeared at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> (Bomberg), (12 vols., 1520-23). The advantage of this edition consists in its complete character; the text itself is full of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. A certain reputation is enjoyed by the Amsterdam edition (1644-48), in which the censured passages have been as far as possible restored. The edition of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> (1720-22) served directly or indirectly as a basis for those which followed. Of the later editions may be mentioned those of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> (1862-68), <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1864-72), and Vilna (1880-86). A quarto edition, the text after the editio princeps, with the variants of the <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and a German translation, was begun by Lazarus Goldschmidt in 1897. Up to date 6 vols., containing the Institutes I, II, IV, V, and the two first treatises of III have appeared. Unfortunately this publication is by no means faultless. M.L. Rodkinson, "New Edition of the Babylonian Talmud", New York, 1896; M. Mielziner, "Introduction to the Talmud" (Cincinnati, 1894; New York, 1903); M.L. Rodkinson, "The History of the Talmud" (New York, 1903); H.L. Strack, "Einleitung in den Talmud" (Leipzig 1908), pp. 139-175, containing an extensive bibliography of the Talmud and of the questions concerning it.
