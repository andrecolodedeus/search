<h1>Tanagra</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a> in Hellas, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>; it was a town of B&oelig;otia, in a fertile plain on the right bank of the &AElig;sopus. It was also called Poemandria and its territory Poemandris. In 457 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> the Athenians were defeated near Tanagra by the Laced&aelig;monians, but early in the following year they in turn defeated the B&oelig;otians, thereby becoming masters of B&oelig;otia. The city walls were destroyed. In 426 the Athenians invaded the territory of Tanagra and defeated the Tanagrians and B&oelig;otians. The people of Tanagra were noted for their frugality, loyalty, and hospitality. Their land yielded little wheat, but the best wine in B&oelig;otia, and the town was also noted for its fighting-cocks. Under <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> Tanagra and Thespi&aelig; were the chief towns of B&oelig;otia. It had numerous <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>, one of Dionysius with a famous <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> by Calanus and a remarkable Triton, other <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> of Themis, Aphrodite, Apollo, Hermes Criophorus, and Hermes Promaclius. The gymnasium contained a portrait of the poetess, Corinna, who was born at Tanagra and commemorated there by a monument. Pliny calls Tanagra a free state. It was still important in the sixth century, but must soon after have been destroyed by <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> invasions. A station on the railway between Athens and Thebes is now called Tanagra; it connects with the village of Skimatari (650 inhabitants), about eight miles south of which are the ruins of the ancient town including the acropolis, <a href="../cathen/03504a.htm">necropolis</a> etc. Excavations have made the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> famous for the pretty little terra-cotta figurines which they contain. Duchesne has published ("Bulletin de correspondance hell&eacute;nique", III, Paris, 1879, 144) a <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">Christian inscription</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the fifth or sixth century. Only one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is known, Hesychius, who in 458 signed the letter from the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">provincial synod</a> to the Emperor Leo (<a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a>, "Oriens Christ.", II, 212); the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> mentioned by him belongs to another see.
