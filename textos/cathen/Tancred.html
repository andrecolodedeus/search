<h1>Tancred</h1>  

<p>Prince of Antioch, born about 1072; died at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, 12 Dec., 1112. He was the son of Marquess Odo and Emma, probably the daughter of <a href="../cathen/07072b.htm">Robert Guiscard</a>. He took the Cross in 1096 with the Norman lords of Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and joined the service of his uncle Bohemund. Having disembarked at Arlona (Epirus), they marched towards Constantinople, and Tancred soon attracted attention by his activity, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a>, and somewhat undisciplined <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>; according to his biographer, Raoul de Caen, he was noted also for his humanity and kindness towards the defenceless. He brilliantly repulsed the Byzantine army which attacked him as he was crossing the Vardar (28 Feb., 1097) from which time Tancred became and remained the bitter enemy of the Greeks. Unlike Bohemund, he was the only one of all the leaders who refused to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of fidelity demanded by Alexis Comnenus. He played an important part in the siege of Nic&aelig;a, and later, during the difficult march through <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, he led the way southwards and captured Tarsus which Baldwin tried in vain to wrest from him (Sept., 1097). While Baldwin advanced towards the Euphrates, Tancred seized the towns of Cilicia. He took an active part also in the siege of Antioch. In the march on <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> he commanded the vanguard, and on 15 July, 1099, he entered the city, after making a breach in the gate of St. Stephen. He vainly endeavoured to save the lives of 300 <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a> who had taken refuge in the Mosque of Omar (<em>Templum Domini</em>). On the other hand he looted the treasures amassed in that building and distributed them among his <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>. He received from <a href="../cathen/06624b.htm">Godfrey de Bouillon</a>, who had been selected over him as king, the fiefs of <a href="../cathen/14716a.htm">Tiberias</a> and Ca&iuml;fa. When Bohemund was captured by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in July, 1100, Tancred assumed the government of the Principality of Antioch, and extended its boundaries at the expense of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and the Greeks. During the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between Bohemund and Alexis Comnenus (1104-08), Tancred defended both the Principality of Antioch and the Courtship of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>; he also strengthened the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> power in those districts, and refused to recognize the Treaty of Durazzo by which Bohemund had ceded the suzerainty of Antioch to the emperor. A skilled politician, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to placate the Greeks and issued Greek money on which he is represented adorned with gold and jewels, wearing a turban surmounted by a cross.
