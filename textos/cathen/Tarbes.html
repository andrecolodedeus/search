<p>DIOCESE OF TARBES (TARBIA)

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> of Tarbes comprises the Department of the Hautes-Pyrenees (ancient territory of Bigorre), included in 1802 in the <a href="../cathen/02360b.htm">Diocese of Bayonne</a>, re-established theoretically by the Concordat of 1817 and actually by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 6 October, 1822.

<p>The new Diocese of Tarbes lost twenty-one <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> which were added to the <a href="../cathen/02360b.htm">Diocese of Bayonne</a>, and twenty to the <a href="../cathen/02067c.htm">Archdiocese of Auch</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the country of the Quatre Valees and of the Vallee de Louron, formerly part of the <a href="../cathen/02067c.htm">archdiocese of Auch</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> of Comminges, were reunited to the Diocese of Tarbes, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/02067c.htm">Auch</a>.

<p>Tradition has preserved the names of St. Girinus and St. Evex or Erex, as the first <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of Bigorre. The district was laid waste by the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a>, who were afterwards put to flight by St. Missolinus, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; it was disturbed by the <a href="../cathen/12429b.htm">Priscillianist heresy</a> and finally terrorized by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a>, who, in the reign of Ewarik, waged a bloody <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> against the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>.

<p>Mgr Duchesne considers <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> whom the <a href="../cathen/06350c.htm">"Gallia Christiana"</a> cites as the first in the list of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Tarbes, to have been only a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and excludes from the list <a href="../cathen/06019b.htm">Faustus of Riez</a>. He considers Aper, represented at the <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Council of Agde</a> in 506, as the first historically known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Among the successors are cited: St. Landeolus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 870; William I (1120-41) who helped draw up the ancient "For de Bigorre," one of the oldest and most curious monuments of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">middle Ages</a>; Pierre de Foix (1462-64), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1437; Gabriel de Gramont (1524-34), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1531, who attempted to negotiate between <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to prevent a rupture.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Savin of Lavedan was founded by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> and shortly took the name of the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> worker, St. Savin, who was one of its <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and died before 840; the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was lord of the territory and the villages under his obedience were called a republic. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbeys of St. Orens of Larreule and of St. Orens of Lavedan were founded, one in 970 and the other before the eleventh century in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Orens, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02067c.htm">Auch</a>, who had first lived as a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> in the Lavedan. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St-Pe de Generes, was founded about 1032 by Sanche, Duke of Gascony; it was the cradle of the town of Saint-Pe. The <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of Sarrancolin was founded about 1050 in memory of St. Ebbons, who fought against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> in <a href="../cathen/03428a.htm">Catalonia</a> and died at Sarrancolin. The Abbey of Escale Dieu was founded in 1140; it was the daughter of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbey of Morimond. St. Bertrand of Comminges was one of its <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; another, St. Raymond, was sent to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in 1158, where he founded the Abbey of Fitere, and the celebrated semi-religious, semi-military <a href="../cathen/03149d.htm">order of Calatrava</a>. St. Bertrand, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Comminges (1073-1123), preached the Gospel in the Vallee d'Azun in the Diocese of Tarbes. To make amends for the hostile reception that had been given him, the inhabitants pledged themselves to give the See of Comminges all the butter that should be produced in the territory of Azun during the week preceding Pentecost; this impost was paid down to 1789. As natives of Bigorre may be cited: Cardinal Arnaud d'Ossat (1536-1604), born at Larroque Magnoac, who played an important part in the reign of Henry IV; Bernard pierre Carasse, born at Tarbes at the opening of the sixteenth century, who, from being a warrior, became general of the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>, revised the constitutions of the order, and was so illustrious in his day, that in 1582 <a href="../cathen/03443a.htm">Catherine de Medici</a> visited La Chartreuse to see him.

<p>The fame of the Diocese of Tarbes has been spread throughout the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a> since 1858 by the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of <a href="../cathen/09389b.htm">Lourdes</a>. Mention must also be made of the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of Notre Dame de Garraison at Monleon, dating back to the fifteenth century; that of Notre Dame de Poueylahun near Eaux Bonnes, dating back to the sixteenth century; the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Mazeres, near the vacant shrine of St. Liberata, perhaps a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> under <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Arreau, to the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of <a href="../cathen/05731a.htm">St. Exuperius</a>, friend of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, who died <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, about 417, after combating the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Vigilantius.

<p>Before the application of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 1901 against the congregations there were in the Diocese of Tarbes, the Priests of the Immaculate Conception at Lourdes, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, and various teaching orders of brothers. Several congregations of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> were originally founded in the diocese: the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, hospitallers and teachers, with their mother-house at Cantaous; the Sisters of Notre-Dame des Douleurs, hospitallers, with their mother-house at Tarbes, and a branch house in Cairo; the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception of Notre-Dame de Lourdes, with their mother-house at Lourdes.

<p>At the close of the nineteenth century the religious congregations directed in the diocese: 5 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1 home for sick children, 1 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the deaf and dumb, 6 girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 6 workshops, 3 homes for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, 12 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or hospices, 3 houses of retreat, 6 houses of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> devoted to nursing the sick in their own homes. At the time of the abrogation of the Concordat (1905) the Diocese of Tarbes contained 215,546 inhabitants, 28 cures, 300 succursal churches, and 135 vicariates towards the support of which the State contributed.
