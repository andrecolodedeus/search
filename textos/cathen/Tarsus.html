<h1>Tarsus</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> of Cilicia Prima. It appears to have been of <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> origin and is mentioned several times in the campaigns of Salmanasar and Sennacherib. The Greek legend connects it with the memory of Sardanapalus, still preserved in the Dunuk-Tach, called <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Sardanapalus, a monument of unknown origin. When in the year 401 B.C., the younger Cyrus marched against Babylon, the city was governed by King Syennesis in the name of the Persian monarch. Tarsus was already Greek and had a tendency to become more and more hellenized. Alexander the Great came near meeting his death there after a bath in the Cydnus, the modern Tarsus-Irmak. By its literary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, Tarsus rivalled Athens and <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. It was then comprised in the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/13690a.htm">Seleucides</a>, took the name of Antioch, and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> (<a href="../bible/2ma004.htm#vrs30">2 Maccabees 4:30</a>) records its revolt against Antiochus IV Epiphanes, about 171 B.C. Pompey subjected it to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. To flatter Caesar it took the name of <a href="../cathen/08560a.htm">Juliopolis</a>; it was there that Cleopatra and Anthony met, and it was the scene of the celebrated feasts which they gave during the construction of their fleet. Tarsus was already the caput Ciliciae, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>, where the governor resided. When the province was divided it remained the civil and religious <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of Cilicia Prima. The greatest glory of Tarsus is that it was the birthplace of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/act009.htm#vrs11">Acts 9:11</a>; <a href="../bible/act021.htm#vrs39">21:39</a>; <a href="../bible/act022.htm#vrs3">22:3</a>), who took refuge there after his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> (<a href="../bible/act009.htm#vrs30">Acts 9:30</a>), and was joined by Barnabas (<a href="../bible/act011.htm#vrs25">Acts 11:25</a>). It is probable that at the time a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community was established there, although the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Helenus, dates only from the third century; he went several times to Antioch in connexion with the dispute concerning <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a> (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.46</a> and <a href="../fathers/250107.htm">VII.5</a>). <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> (Oriens christianus, II, 869-76) mentions twenty-two of its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, of whom several are legendary. Among them are Lupus, present at the Council of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a> in 314; Theodorus, at that of Nicaea in 325; Helladius, condemned at Ephesus, and who appealed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 433; above all the celebrated <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegete</a> Diodorus, teacher of <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a> and consequently one of the fathers of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>. From the sixth century the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of Tarsus had seven suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> (Echos d'Orient, X, 145); the Greek archdiocese is again mentioned in the tenth century (op. cit., X, 98), and has existed down to the present day, being comprised in the Patriarchate of Antioch. Owing to the importance of Tarsus many <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> there, among them being <a href="../cathen/11601d.htm">St. Pelagia</a>, St. Boniface, St. Marinus, St. Diomedus, and Sts. Cerycus and Julitta; several Roman emperors were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> there --- namely, Tacitus, Maximinus Daza, and <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> took possession of Tarsus from the seventh century and kept it until 965, when Nicephorus Phocas annexed it again to the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>. The union continued for nearly a century. The <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> captured it again from the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in 1097, and then it was disputed between Latins, Greeks, and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> of the Kingdom of Lesser <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>; these last became definitively masters until about 1350, when it was sold to the Egyptians. Since then Tarsus has belonged to the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>. About the end of the tenth century, the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> established a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of their rite, which still exists; <a href="../cathen/10754b.htm">St. Nerses of Lambroun</a> was its most distinguished representative in the twelfth century. Tarsus, which has preserved it name, is a caza of the vilayet of <a href="../cathen/01135f.htm">Adana</a> on the railroad from <a href="../cathen/01135f.htm">Adana</a> to <a href="../cathen/15757a.htm">Mersina</a>; the city numbers about 18,000 inhabitants, of whom 10,000 are <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>, the remainder are Greek or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>. Only a few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are found there.
