<h1>Tatian</h1>  

<p>A second-century <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a> about whose antecedents and early history nothing can be affirmed with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> except that he was born in <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a> and that he was trained in Greek philosophy. While a young man he travelled extensively. Disgusted with the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">greed</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> with whom he came in contact, he conceived a profound contempt for their teachings. Repelled by the grossness and immorality of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> and attracted by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian religion</a> and the sublimity and simplicity of the Scriptures, he became a convert, probably about A.D. 150. He joined the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian community</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was a "hearer" of <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a>. There is no reason to think he was converted by the latter. While <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> lived Tatian remained <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. Later (c. 172) he <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a>, became a <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratite sect</a>, and returned to the Orient. The circumstances and <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death are not known. Tatian wrote many works. Only two have survived. One of these, "Oratio ad Graecos" (<em>Pros Hellenas</em>), is an apology for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, containing in the first part (i-xxxi) an exposition of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> with a view to showing its superiority over Greek philosophy, and in the second part a demonstration of the high antiquity of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. The tone of this apology is bitter and denunciatory. The author inveighs against Hellenism in all its forms and expresses the deepest contempt for Greek philosophy and Greek manners.

<p>The other extant work is the "Diatesseron", a harmony of the four Gospels containing in continuous narrative the principle events in the life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>. The question regarding the language in which this work was composed is still in dispute. Lightfoot, Hilgenfeld, Bardenhewer, and others contend that the original language was Syriac. Harnack, Burkitt, and others are equally positive that it was composed in Greek and translated into Syriac during the lifetime of Tatian. There are only a few fragments extant in Syriac but a comparatively full reconstruction of the whole has been effected from <a href="../cathen/05498a.htm">St. Ephraem's</a> commentary, the Syriac text of which has been lost, but which exists in an <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> version. Two revisions of the "Diatesseron" are available: one in Latin preserved in the "Codex Fuldensis" of the Gospels dating from about A.D. 545, the other in an Arabic version found in two <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of a later date. The "Diatesseron" or "Evangelion da Mehallete" (the Gospel of the mixed) was practically the only gospel text used in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> during the third and fourth centuries. Rabbula, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> (411-435), ordered the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> to see that every church should have a copy of the separate Gospels (Evangelion da Mepharreshe), and Theodoret, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cyrus (423-457), removed more than two hundred copies of the "Diatesseron" from the churches in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Several other works written Tatian have disappeared. In his apology (xv) he mentions a work "on animals" and (xvi) one on the "nature of demons". Another work in refutation of the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (xl) was planned but perhaps never written. He also wrote a "Book of Problems" (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.13</a>), dealing with the difficulties in the Scriptures, and one "On Perfection according to the Precepts of Our Saviour" (<a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, <a href="../fathers/02103.htm"><em>Stromata</em> III.12, 81</a>).
