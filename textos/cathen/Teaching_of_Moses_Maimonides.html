<h1>Teaching of Moses Maimonides</h1>  

<p>Moses ben Maimun (Arabic, Abu Amran Musa), Jewish commentator and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, was born of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> Jewish <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> at <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a> in 1135. After sojourning with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, Palestine, and Northern Africa, he settled down at Old Cairo, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, in 1165. There he received the office of court physician, and at the same time, as head of the Jewish communities in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, devoted himself to the exposition of the Talmud. He died at Cairo, 13 December, 1204, and was buried at <a href="../cathen/14716a.htm">Tiberias</a> in Palestine. His writings include: (1) Commentaries: (a) "Kit&aacute;b al-Siraj", a commentary on the Mishnah, written in Arabic and translated into Hebrew (first published 1492), Latin (Oxford, 1654), and German (Leipzig, 1863); (b) "Mishneh Torah", or "Yad ha-Hazakah", written in Hebrew, and many times published (first ed. in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 1480; latest, Vilna, 1900); translated in part into English in 1863 by Bernard and Soloweyczik; (2) Philosophical Works: (a) "Dalalat al-Ha&rsquo;ir&#238;n", translated into Hebrew as "Moreh Neb&#251;k&#238;m" (1204), and into Latin as "Doctor Perplexorum", "Dux Dubitantium". The Arabic Original was published, with a French translation entitled "Guide des &eacute;gar&eacute;s" by Munk (13 vols., Paris, 1856-66). An English translation of portion of it by Townley appeared as "The Reasons of the Laws of Moses" (London, 1827), and a version of the whole work under the title "The Guide of the Perplexed" by Friedl&#228;nder (London, 1889); (b) Minor Philosophical Works: "On the Unity of God", "On Happiness", "On the Terminology of Logic", "On Resurrection" etc.; (3) Medical and Astronomical Works: Several treatises on poisons, on hygiene, a commentary on Hippocrates, on the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> principles of the Jewish calendar etc.

<p>Through the "Guide of the Perplexed" and the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> introductions to sections of his commentaries on the Mishna, Maimonides exerted a very important influence on the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, especially on <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albert the Great</a>, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a>. He was himself a Jewish <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a>. Educated more by reading the works of the Arabian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> than by personal contact with Arabian teachers, he acquired through the abundant <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> literature in the Arabic language an intimate acquaintance with the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, and strove earnestly to reconcile the philosophy of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Stagirite</a> with the teachings of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. The principle which inspired all his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> activity was identical with the fundamental tenet of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>: there can be no contradiction between the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has revealed and the findings of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> in <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Moreover, by <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and philosophy he understood the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and philosophy of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>. In some important points, however, he departed from the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> text, holding, for instance, that the world is not eternal, as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> taught, but was created <em>ex nihilo,</em> as is taught explicitly in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. Again, he rejected the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">God's provident care</a> extends only to humanity, and not to the individual. But, while in these important points, Maimonides forestalled the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> and undoubtedly influenced them, he was led by his admiration for the <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonic</a> commentators and by the bent of his own mind, which was essentially Jewish, to maintain many doctrines which the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> could not accept. For instance, he pushed too far the principle of negative predication in regard to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> agreed with him that no predicate is adequate to express the <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">nature of God</a>, but they did not go so far as to say that no term can be applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the affirmative sense. They admitted that while "eternal", "omnipotent", etc., as we apply them to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are inadequate, at the same time we may say "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is eternal" etc., and need not stop, as Moses did, with the negative "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not not-eternal", etc.

<p>The most characteristic of all his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> doctrines is that of acquired <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. He distinguishes two kinds of intelligence in man, the one <em>material</em> in the sense of being dependent on, and influenced by, the body, and the other <em>immaterial,</em> that is, independent of the bodily organism. The latter is a direct emanation from the universal active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> (this is his interpretation of the <em>no&#251;s poietik&oacute;s</em> of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> philosophy), and is acquired as the result of the efforts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to attain a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the absolute, pure intelligence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which, so to speak, develops in us the immaterial intelligence, and thus confers on man an immaterial or spiritual nature. This immateriality not only confers on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that perfection in which human <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists, but also endows the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. He who has attained a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has reached a condition of existence which renders him immune from all the accidents of fortune, from all the allurements of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and even from death itself. Man, therefore, since he has it in his power to attain this salutary <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, is in a position not only to work out his own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but also to work out his own <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. The resemblance between this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and <a href="../cathen/14217a.htm">Spinoza's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> is so striking as to warrant the hypothesis that there is a causal dependence of the later on the earlier <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. The difference between the two Jewish thinkers is, however, as remarkable as the resemblance. While <a href="../cathen/14217a.htm">Spinoza</a> teaches that the way to attain the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which confers <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> is the progress from sense-knowledge through scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> of all things <em>sub specie &aelig;ternitatis</em>, Moses holds that the road to perfection and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> is the path of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> as described in the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">Law of God</a>.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> questions which Moses discussed were the nature of prophecy and the reconciliation of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> with the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He agrees with "the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>" in teaching that, man's intelligence being one in the series of intelligences emanating from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> must, by study and meditation, lift himself up to the degree of perfection required in the prophetic state. But here he invokes the authority of "the Law", which teaches that, after that perfection is reached, there is required the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> before the man actually becomes the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. In his solution of the problem of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, he follows the <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonists</a> in laying stress on matter as the source of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and imperfection.
