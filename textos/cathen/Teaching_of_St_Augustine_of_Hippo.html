<h1>Teaching of St. Augustine of Hippo</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine of Hippo</a> (354-430) is "a philosophical and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> genius of the first order, dominating, like a pyramid, antiquity and the succeeding ages. Compared with the great philosophers of past centuries and modern times, he is the equal of them all; among <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> he is undeniably the first, and such has been his influence that none of the Fathers, <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> has surpassed it." (Philip Schaff, <em>History of the Christian Church</em>) Elsewhere, we have discussed his <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">life</a> and his <a href="../cathen/02089a.htm">writings</a>; here, we shall treat of his teaching and influence in three sections:</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="../cathen/02091a.htm#I">I. His Function as a Doctor of the Church</a><br><a href="../cathen/02091a.htm#II">II. His System of Grace</a><br><a href="../cathen/02091a.htm#III">III. Augustinism in History</a></p></blockquote>

<h2 id="i">His function as a doctor of the Church</h2>

<p>When the critics endeavour to determine <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> place in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> and of civilization, there can be no question of exterior or political influence, such as was exercised by <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo</a>, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, or <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>. As Reuter* justly observes, Augustine was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of a third-rate city and had scarcely any direct control over politics, and Harnack adds that perhaps he had not the qualifications of a statesman. If Augustine occupies a place apart in the history of humanity, it is as a thinker, his influence being felt even outside the realm of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and playing a most potent part in the orientation of Western thought. It is now universally conceded that, in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> field, this influence is unrivalled even by that of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a>, and Augustine's teaching marks a distinct epoch in the history of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> thought. The better to emphasize this important fact we shall try to determine: (1) the rank and degree of influence that must be ascribed to Augustine; (2) the nature, or the elements, of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> influence; (3) the general qualities of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>; and (4) the character of his genius.</p>
<h3 id="A">The greatest of the doctors</h3>

<p>It is first of all a remarkable fact that the great critics, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, are almost unanimous in placing <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> in the foremost rank of Doctors and proclaiming him to be the greatest of the Fathers. Such, indeed, was also the opinion of his contemporaries, judging from their expressions of enthusiasm gathered by the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> attributed such exceptional authority to the Doctor of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> that, even of late years, it has given rise to lively <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> controversies. Peter the Venerable accurately summarized the general sentiment of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> when he ranked Augustine immediately after the Apostles; and in modern times <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, whose genius was most like that of Augustine, assigns him the first place among the Doctors, nor does he simply call him the incomparable Augustine," but "the Eagle of Doctors," "the Doctor of Doctors." If the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> abuse of his works and perhaps the exaggerations of certain <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, as well as the attack of Richard Simon, seem to have alarmed some minds, the general opinion has not varied. In the nineteenth century St&ouml;ckl expressed the thought of all when he said, "Augustine has justly been called the greatest <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctor of the Catholic world</a>."</p>

<p>And the admiration of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> critics is not less enthusiastic. More than this, it would seem as if they had in these latter days been quite specially fascinated by the great figure of Augustine, so deeply and so assiduously have they studied him (Bindemann, Schaff, Dorner, Reuter, A. Harnack, Eucken, Scheel, and so on) and all of them agree more or less with Harnack when he says: "Where, in the history of the West, is there to be found a man who, in point of influence, can be compared with him?" <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> were content to treat Augustine with a little less irreverence than they did the other Fathers, but their descendants do him full <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, although recognizing him as the Father of <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholicism</a>. According to Bindemann, "Augustine is a star of extraordinary brilliancy in the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Since the apostles he has been unsurpassed." In his "History of the Church" Dr. Kurtz calls Augustine "the greatest, the most powerful of all the Fathers, him from whom proceeds all the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> development of the West, and to whom each recurring crisis, each new orientation of thought brings it back." Schaff himself (Saint Augustine, <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> and Neander, p. 98) is of the same opinion: "While most of the great men in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> are claimed either by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> confession, and their influence is therefore confined to one or the other, he enjoys from both a respect equally profound and enduring." Rudolf Eucken is bolder still, when he says: "On the ground of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> proper a single <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> has appeared and that is Augustine." The English Miter, W. Cunningham, is no less appreciative of the extent and perpetuity of this extraordinary influence: "The whole life of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Church was framed on lines which he has suggested: its <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders claimed him as their patron; its mystics found a sympathetic tone in his teaching; its polity was to some extent the actualization of his picture of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>; it was in its various parts a carrying out of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> which he cherished and diffused. Nor does his influence end with the decline of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medievalism</a>: we shall see presently how closely his language was akin to that of <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a>, who gave the first impulse to and defined the special character of modern philosophy." And after having established that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> was at the bottom of all the struggles between <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, between <a href="../cathen/01740c.htm">Arminians</a> and <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> on the side of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, he adds: "And once more in our own land when a reaction arose against <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> and <a href="../cathen/05514a.htm">Erastinianism</a> it was to the African Doctor that men turned with enthusiasm: <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Dr. Pusey's</a> edition of the <em>Confessions</em> was among the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11370a.htm">Oxford Movement</a>."</p>

<p>But Adolf Harnack is the one who has oftenest emphasized the unique r&ocirc;le of the Doctor of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>. He has studied Augustine's place in the history of the world as reformer of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and his influence as <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctor of the Church</a>. In his study of the "Confessions" he comes back to it: "No man since <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is comparable to him" &#151; with the exception of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, he adds. &#151; "Even today we live by Augustine, by his thought and his spirit; it is said that we are the sons of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, but both one and the other depend upon him."</p>

<h3 id="B">Nature and different aspects of his doctrinal influence</h3>

<p>This influence is so varied and so complex that it is difficult to consider under all its different aspects. First of all, in his writings the great <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> collects and condenses the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> treasures of the old world and transmits them to the new. Harnack goes so far as to say: "It would seem that the miserable existence of the Roman empire in the West was prolonged until then, only to permit Augustine's influence to be exercised on universal history." It was in order to fulfil this enormous task that Providence brought him into contact with the three worlds whose thought he was to transmit: with the Roman and Latin world in the midst of which he lived, with the Oriental world partially revealed to him through the study of <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ism</a>, and with the Greek world shown to him by the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a>. In philosophy he was initiated into the whole content and all the subtilties of the various <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, without, however, giving his allegiance to any one of them. In <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> it was he who acquainted the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> with the great dogmatic work accomplished in the East during the fourth century and at the beginning of the fifth; he popularized the results of it by giving them the more exact and precise form of the Latin genius.</p>

<p>To synthesis of the past, Augustine adds the incomparable wealth of his own thought, and he may be said to have been the most powerful instrument of Providence in development and advance of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. Here the danger has been not in denying, but in exaggerating, this advance. Augustine's dogmatic mission (in a lower sphere and apart from inspiration) recalls that of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in the preaching of the Gospel. It has also been subject to the same attacks and occasioned the same vagaries of criticism. Just as it was sought to make of Paulinism the real source of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it &#151; a system that had smothered the primitive germ of the Gospel of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> &#151; so it was imagined that, under the name of Augustinianism, Augustine had installed in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> some sort of <a href="../cathen/14383c.htm">syncretism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and of <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonism</a> which was a deviation from ancient <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, fortunate according to some, but according to others utterly deplorable. These fantasies do not survive the reading of the texts, and Harnack himself shows in Augustine the heir to the tradition that preceded him. Still, on the other hand, his share of invention and originality in the development of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> must not be ignored, although here and there, on special questions, human weaknesses crop out. He realized, better than any of the Fathers, the progress so well expressed by <a href="../cathen/15439b.htm">Vincent of L&eacute;rins</a>, his contemporary, in a page that some have turned against him.</p>

<p>In general, all <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Christian dogmatics</a> are indebted to him for new theories that better justify and explain revelation, new views, and greater clearness and precision. The many struggles with which he was identified, together with the speculative turn of his mind, brought almost every question within the scope of his research. Even his way of stating problems so left his impress upon them that there Is no problem, one might almost say, in considering which the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> does not feel the study of Augustine's thought to be an imperative <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. Certain <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> in particular he so amply developed, so skilfully unsheathing the fruitful germ of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> from their envelope of tradition, that many of these <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> (wrongly, in our opinion) have been set down as "Augustinism." Augustine was not their inventor, he was only the first to put them in a strong light. They are chiefly the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of the Fall, the Atonement, Grace, and <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">Predestination</a>. Schaff (op. cit. 97) has very properly said: "His appearance in the history of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> forms a distinct epoch, especially as regards anthropological and soteriological doctrines, which he advanced considerably further, and brought to a greater clearness and precision, than they had ever had before in the consciousness of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." But he is not only the Doctor of Grace, he is also the <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctor of the Church</a>: his twenty years' conflict with <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatism</a> led to a complete exposition of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the great work and mystical Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>, of its part in <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and of the intimate efficacy of its <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. It is on this point, as the very centre of Augustinian <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, that Reuter* has concentrated those "Augustinische Studien" which, according to Harnack, are the most learned of recent studies on <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>. <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> controversies also led him to state clearly the great questions of the Divine Being and of the nature of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and he might also be called the Doctor of Good, or of good principles of all things. Lastly, the very idiosyncrasy of his genius and the practical, <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, and Divine imprint left upon all his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> speculations have made him the Doctor of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a>.</p>

<p>Another step forward due to the works of Augustine is in the language of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, for, if he did not create it, he at least contributed towards its definite settlement. It is indebted to him for a great number of epigrammatic formul&aelig;, as significant as they are terse, afterwards singled out and adopted by <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>. Besides, as Latin was more concise and less fluid in its forms than Greek, it was wonderfully well suited to the work. Augustine made it the dogmatic language <em>par excellence</em>, and Anselm, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a>, and others followed his lead. At times he has even been credited with the pseudo-Athanasian creed which is undoubtedly of later date, but those critics were not mistaken who traced its inspiration to the formul&aelig; in "De Trinitate." Whoever its author may have been, he was certainly familiar with Augustine and drew upon his works. It is unquestionably this gift of concise expression, as well as his charity, that has so often caused the celebrated saying to be attributed to him: "In essentials unity, in non-essentials liberty, in all things charity."</p>

<p>Augustine stands forth, too, as the great inspirer of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> thought in subsequent ages. A whole volume would not be sufficient to contain the full account of his influence on posterity; here we shall merely call attention to its principal manifestations. It is, in the first place, a fact of paramount importance that, with <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, the centre of dogmatic and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> development changed from East to West. Hence, from this view-point again, he makes an epoch in the history of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. The critics maintain that up to his time the most powerful influence was exerted by the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, the East having been the classic land of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, the great workshop for the elaboration of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. From the time of Augustine, the predominating influence seems to emanate from the West, and the practical, realistic spirit of the Latin race supplants the speculative and idealistic spirit of Greece and the East. Another fact, no less salient, is that it was the Doctor of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> who, in the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, inspired the two seemingly antagonistic movements, <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> and Mysticism. From <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> to the Fathers of <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>, Augustine's <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> authority, indisputably the highest, dominates all thinkers and is appealed to alike by the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> Anselm, <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a>, and by Bernard, <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14465c.htm">Tauler</a>, exponents of Mysticism, all of whom were nourished upon his writings and penetrated with his spirit. There is not one of even the most modern tendencies of thought but derives from him whatever it may have of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or of profound religious sentiment. Learned critics, such as Harnack, have called Augustine "the first modern <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he so moulded the Latin world that it is really he who has shaped the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of modern <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a>. But, without going so far, we may quote the German <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, Eucken: "It is perhaps not paradoxical to say that if our age wishes to take up and treat in an independent way the problem of religion, it is not so much to Schleiermacher or <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>, or even <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> or <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, that it must refer, as to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>.... And outside of religion, there are points upon which Augustine is more modern than <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a> or Schopenhauer."</p>
<h3 id="C">The dominating qualities of his doctrine</h3>

<p>The better to understand St. Augustine's influence, we must point out in his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> certain general characteristics which must not be lost sight of, if, in reading his works, one would avoid troublesome misapprehensions.

<p>First, the full development of the great Doctor's mind was progressive. It was by stages, often aided by the circumstances and necessities of controversy, that he arrived at the exact <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of each <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and a clean-cut perception of its place in the synthesis of revelation. He also requires that his readers should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to "advance with him." It is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to study St. Augustine's works in historical order and, as we shall see, this applies particularly to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of grace.</p>

<p>Augustinian <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is, again, essentially <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, and has <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for its centre. To be sure Augustine is a great <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a> said of him: "If an enlightened man were to gather from the books of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> the sublime <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which this great man has scattered at random therein, such a compendium [<em>extrait</em>], made with discrimination, would be far superior to <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes'</a> Meditations." And indeed just such a collection was made by the Oratorian ontologist, Andr&eacute; Martin. There is then a philosophy of St. Augustine, but in him philosophy is so Intimately coupled with <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> as to be inseparable from it. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> historians have remarked this characteristic of his writings. "The world," says Eucken, "interests him less than" the action of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the world and especially in ourselves. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are the only subjects the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> Of which ought to fire us with enthusiasm. All <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> becomes moral, religious <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, or rather a moral, religious conviction, an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on the part of man, who gives himself up unreservedly." And with still greater energy B&ouml;hringer has said: "The axis on which the heart, life and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> of Augustine move is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Oriental discussions on the Word had forced <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> to set <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Word and in Christ, the Saviour, at the very summit of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>; Augustine, too, in his <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, places the Incarnation at the centre of the Divine plan, but he looks upon it as the great historic manifestation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to humanity &#151; the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> dominates all: of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> considered in His essence (On the Trinity), in His government (The City of God) or as the last end of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life (<em>Enchiridion and On the Christian Combat</em>).</p>

<p>Lastly, Augustine's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> bears an eminently <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> stamp and is radically opposed to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. It is important to establish this fact, principally because of the change in the attitude of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> critics towards <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>. Indeed, nothing is more deserving of attention than this development so highly creditable to the impartiality of modern writers. The thesis of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of olden times is well known. Attempts to monopolize Augustine and to make him an ante-Reformation reformer, were certainly not wanting. Of course <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> had to admit that he did not find in Augustine <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, that generating principle of all <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>; and Schaff tells us that he consoled himself with exclaiming (op. sit., p. 100): "Augustine has often <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a>, he is not to be trusted. Although good and holy, he was yet lacking in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as well as the other Fathers." But in general, the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> did not so easily fall into line, and for a long time it was customary to oppose the great name of Augustine to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. Article 20 of the Confession of Augsburg dares to ascribe to him justification without works, and <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> invokes his authority in his "Apologia Confessionis." In the last thirty or forty years all has been changed, and the best <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> critics now vie with one another in proclaiming the essentially <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> character of Augustinian <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. In fact they go to extremes when they claim him to be the founder of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. It is thus that H. Reuter* concludes his very important studies on the Doctor of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>: "I consider Augustine the founder of <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholicism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a>....This is no new discovery, as Kattenbusch seems to believe, but a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> long since recognized by Neander, Julius K&ouml;stlin, Dorner, Schmidt, ...etc.." Then, as to whether Evangelicalism is to be found in Augustine, he says: "Formerly this point was reasoned out very differently from what it is nowadays. The phrases so much in use from 1830 to 1870: <em>Augustine is the Father of evangelical <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> and <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> is the Father of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a></em>, are now rarely met with. They have since been acknowledged to be untenable, although they contain a <em>particula veri</em>." Philip Schaff reaches the same conclusion; and Dorner says, "It is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> to ascribe to Augustine the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> that inspired the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>." No one, however, has put this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> in a stronger light than Harnack. Quite recently, in his 14th lesson on "The Essence of Christianity," he characterized the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> by three elements, the third of which is Augustinism, the thought and the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of .htm-->St. Augustine. "In fact Augustine has exerted over the whole inner life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> and <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> thought, an absolutely decisive influence." And again he says, "In the fifth century, at the hour when the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> inherited the Roman Empire, she had within her a man of extraordinarily deep and powerful genius: from him she took her <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, and to this present hour she has been unable to break away from them." In his "History of Dogma" (English tr., V, 234, 235) the same critic dwells at length upon the features of what he calls the "popular <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>" to which Augustine belongs. These features are (a) the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as a hierarchical institution with <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> authority; (b) eternal life by merits, and disregard of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> thesis of "salvation by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" &#151; that is, <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by that firm confidence in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of pardon produces (c) the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> &#151; in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; (d) the distinction between commands and counsel &#151; between grievous sine and venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> &#151; the scale of wicked men and good men &#151; the various degrees of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> according to one's <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">deserts</a>; (e) Augustine is accused of "outdoing the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>" of this popular <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> &#151; the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> value of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> satisfaction, <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> considered as enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> &#151; the mysterious efficacy of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> (<em>ex opere operato</em>) &#151; Mary's virginity even in childbirth &#151; the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of her purity and her conception, unique in their kind." Harnack does not assert that Augustine taught the Immaculate Conception, but Schaff (op. cit., p. 98) says unhesitatingly: "He is responsible also for many grievous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>...he anticipated the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary, and his ominous word, <em>Roma locuta est, causa finite est</em>, might almost be quoted in favour of the Vatican <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it were a mistake to suppose that modern <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> relinquish all claim upon Augustine; they will have it that, despite his essential <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, it was he who inspired <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>. The new thesis, therefore, is that each of the two Churches may claim him in turn. Burke's expression quoted by Schaff (ibid., p. 102) is characteristic: "In Augustine ancient and modern <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are melted and to his authority the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Church has as much right to appeal as the Churches of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>." No one notes this contradiction more clearly than Loofs. After stating that Augustine has accentuated the characteristic elements of <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western (Catholic) Christianity</a>, that in succeeding ages he became its Father, and that "the Ecclesiasticism of <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholicism</a>, <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>, <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">Mysticism</a>, and even the claims of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> to temporal rule, are founded upon a tendency initiated by him," Loofs also affirms that he is the teacher of all the reformers and their bond of union, and concludes with this strange paradox: "The history of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> is the history of the progressive elimination of Augustinism." The singular aptitude of these critics for supposing the existence of flagrant contradictions in a genius like Augustine is not so astonishing when we remember that, with Reuter, they justify this theory by the reflection: "In whom are to be found more frequent contradictions than in <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>?" But their theories are based upon a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> interpretation of Augustine's opinion, which is frequently misconstrued by those who are not sufficiently familiar with his language and terminology.</p>
<h3 id="D">The character of his genius</h3>

<p>We have now to ascertain what is the dominating quality which accounts for his fascinating influence upon posterity. One after another the critics have considered the various aspects of this great genius. Some have been particularly impressed by the depth and originality of his conceptions, and for these Augustine is the great sower of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> by which future minds are to live. Others, like <a href="../cathen/08566b.htm">Jungmann</a> and St&ouml;ckl, have praised in him the marvellous harmony of all the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind's</a> higher qualities, or, again, the universality and the compass of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. "In the great <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">African</a> Doctor," says the Rev. J. A.  Zahm (Bible, Science and Faith, Fr. tr., 56), "we seem to have found united and combined the powerful and penetrating <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, the deep scientific conceptions of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> suppleness of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, the grace and eloquence of Basil and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>. Whether we consider him as <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, as <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, or as <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetist</a>...he still appears admirable the unquestioned Master of all the centuries." Philip Schaff (op. cit., p. 97) admires above all "such a rare union of the speculative talent of the Greek and of the practical spirit of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> as he alone possessed." In all these opinions there is a great measure of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; nevertheless we believe that the dominating characteristic of Augustine's genius and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> secret of his influence are to be found in his heart &#151; a heart that penetrates the most exalted speculations of a profound mind and animates them with the most ardent feeling. It is at bottom only the traditional and general estimate of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> that we express; for he has always been represented with a heart for his emblem, just as <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a> with a sun. <a href="../cathen/02710c.htm">Mgr. Bougaud</a> thus interpreted this symbol: "Never did man unite in one and the same <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> such stern rigour of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> with such tenderness of heart." This is also the opinion of Harnack, B&ouml;hringer, <a href="../cathen/11134a.htm">Nourisson</a>, Storz, and others. Great intellectuality admirably fused with an enlightened <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> is Augustine's distinguishing characteristic. Truth is not for him only an object of contemplation; it is a good that must be possessed, that must be <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> and lived by. What constitutes Augustine's genius is his marvellous gift of embracing <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with all the fibres of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; not with the heart alone, for the heart does not think; not with the mind alone, for the mind grasps only the abstract or, as it were, lifeless <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Augustine seeks the living <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and even when he is combating certain <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> he is of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, not of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>. He belongs indisputably to all ages because he is in touch with all <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, but he is preeminently modern because his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is not the cold light of the School; he is living and penetrated with personal sentiment. Religion is not a simple theory, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is not a series of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>; It Is also a life, as they say nowadays, or, more accurately, a source of life. However, let us not be deceived. Augustine is not a sentimentalist, a pure mystic, and heart alone does not account for his power. If in him the hard, cold intellectuality of the metaphysician gives place to an impassioned vision of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is the basis of it all. He never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the vaporous <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> of our day, that allows itself to be lulled by a vague, aimless sentimentalism. His emotion is deep, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, engrossing, precisely because it is born of a strong, secure, accurate dogmatism that wishes to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what it loves and why it loves. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is life, but life in the eternal, unchangeable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And if none of the Fathers has put so much of his heart into his writings, neither has any turned upon <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the searchlight of a stronger, clearer <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. </p>

<p>Augustine's passion is characterized not by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, but by a communicative tenderness; and his exquisite delicacy experiences first one and then another of the most intimate emotions and tests them; hence the irresistible effect of the "Confessions." Feuerlein, a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> thinker, has brought out in relief (exaggeratedly, to be sure, and leaving the marvellous powers of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in the shade) Augustine's exquisite sensibility &#151; what he calls the "feminine elements" of his genius. He says: "It was not merely a chance or accidental part that his mother, Monica, played in his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> development, and therein lies what essentially distinguishes him from <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, of whom it was said: "Everything about him bespeaks the man". And <a href="../cathen/13545b.htm">Schl&ouml;sser</a>, whom Feuerlein quotes, is not afraid to say that Augustine's works contain more genuine poetry than all the writings of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>. At least it cannot be denied that no thinker ever caused so many and such salutary tears to flow. This characteristic of Augustine's genius explains his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> work. <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">Christian dogmas</a> are considered in relation to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the great <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life, rather than to themselves and in a speculative fashion. This alone explains his division of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the "Enchiridion," which at first sight seems so strange. He assembles all <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> in the three <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> virtues, considering in the mysteries the different activities of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that must live by them. Thus, in the Incarnation, he assigns the greatest part to the moral side, to the triumph of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. For this reason, also, Augustine's work bears an imprint, until then unknown, of living <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> peeping out everywhere. He inaugurates that literature in which the author's individuality reveals itself in the most abstract matters, the "Confessions" being an inimitable example of it. It is in this connection that Harnack admires the African Doctor's gift of <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> observation and a captivating facility for portraying his penetrating observations. This talent, he says, is the secret of Augustine's originality and greatness. Again, it is this same characteristic that distinguishes him from the other Doctors and gives him his own special temperament. The practical side of a question appealed to the Roman mind of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, too, but he never rises to the same heights, nor moves the heart as deeply as does his disciple of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. Jerome is a, more learned exegetist, better equipped in respect of Scriptural erudition; he is even purer in his style; but, despite his impetuous ardour, he is less animated, less striking, than his correspondent of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>. <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, too, is subtile in the metaphysical analysis of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, but he does not appeal to the heart and take hold of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> like the African Doctor. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> played the part of initiator in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, just as Augustine did in the Western, but his influence, unfortunate in more ways than one, was exercised rather in the sphere of speculative intelligence, while that of Augustine, owing to the qualities of his heart, extended far beyond the realm of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, who of all geniuses most closely resembles Augustine by his elevation and his universality, is his superior in the skilfulness and artistic finish of his works, but he has not the alluring tenderness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and if Augustine fulminates less, he attracts more powerfully, subjugating the mind with gentleness.</p>

<p>Thus may Augustine's universal influence in all succeeding ages be explained: it is due to combined gifts of heart and mind. Speculative genius alone does not sway the multitude; the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> world, apart from professional <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, does not read <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a>. On the other hand, without the clear, definite <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> founders as soon as reason awakes and discovers the emptiness of metaphors: this is always the fate of vague pietism, whether it recognize Christ or not, whether It be extolled by Schleiermacher, Sabatier, or their disciples. But to Augustine's genius, at once enlightened and ardent, the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is accessible, and the whole Church, both teachers and taught, is permeated by his sentiments and <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. A. Harnack, more than any other critic, admires and describes Augustine's influence over all the life of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people. If <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a> is the Doctor of the Schools, Augustine is, according to Harnack, the inspirer and restorer of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. If Thomas inspires the canons of <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>, Augustine, besides having formed Thomas himself, inspires the inner life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of all the great reforms effected within its pale. In his "Essence of Christianity" (14th lesson, 1900, p. 161) Harnack shows how <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> live upon the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of Augustine. "His living has been incessantly relived in the course of the fifteen hundred years that have followed. Even to our days interior and living <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, as well as the mode of its expression, has been essentially Augustinian: the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is permeated by his sentiment, it feels as he felt and rethinks his thoughts. It is the same with many <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> also, and they are by no means among the worst. And even those to whom <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> is but a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the past proclaim that Augustine's influence will live forever."</p>

<p>This genuine emotion is also the veil that hides certain faults from the reader or else makes him oblivious of them. Says Eucken: "Never could Augustine have exercised all the influence he has exercised if it had not been that, in spite of the rhetorical artifice of his utterance, absolute sincerity reigned in the inmost recesses of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." His frequent repetitions are excused because they are the expression of his deep feeling. Schaff says: "His books, with all the faults and repetitions of isolated parts, are a spontaneous outflow from the marvellous treasures of his highly-gifted mind and his truly <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> heart." (<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, p. 96.) But we must also acknowledge that his passion is the source of exaggerations and at times of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> that are fraught with real danger for the inattentive or badly disposed reader. Out of sheer <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for Augustine certain <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> have endeavoured to justify all he wrote, to admire all, and to proclaim him infallible, but nothing could be more detrimental to his glory than such excess of praise. The reaction already referred to arises partly from this. We must recognize that the passion for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> sometimes fixes its attention too much upon one side of a complex question; his too absolute formul&aelig;, lacking qualification, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> in appearance now in one sense now in another. "The oratorical temperament that was his in such a high degree," says Becker, very truly (<em>Revue d'histoire eccl&eacute;siastique</em>, 15 April, 1902, p. 379), "the kind of exaltation that befitted his rich <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and his loving <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, are not the most reliable in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> speculations." Such is the origin of the contradictions alleged against him and of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> ascribed to him by the <a href="../cathen/12376b.htm">predestinarians</a> of all ages. Here we see the r&ocirc;le of the more frigid minds of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a> was a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> corrective to Augustine. He is less great, less original, and, above all, less animated; but the calm didactics of his intellectualism enable him to castigate Augustine's exaggerations with rigorous criticism, to impart exactitude and precision to his terms &#151; in one word, to prepare a dictionary with which the African Doctor may be read without danger.</p>

<h2 id="ii">His system of grace</h2>

<p>It is unquestionably in the great Doctor's solution of the eternal problem of freedom and grace &#151; of the part taken by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and by man, in the affair of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> &#151; that his thought stands forth as most personal, most powerful, and most disputed. <em>Most personal</em>, for he was the first of all to synthesize the great theories of the Fall, grace, and <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>; and moreover it is he who, to reconcile them all, has furnished us with a profound explanation which is in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> his, and of which we can find no trace in his predecessors. Hence, the term <em>Augustinism</em> is often exclusively used to designate his system of grace. <em>Most powerful</em>, for, as all admit, it was he above all others who won the triumph of liberty against the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, and of grace against the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>. His <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> has, in the main, been solemnly accepted by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the canons of the Council of Orange are borrowed from his works. <em>Most disputed, also</em>.&mdash;Like <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, whose teachings he develops, he has often been quoted, often not understood. Friends and enemies have exploited his teaching in the most diverse senses. It has not been grasped, not only by the opponents of liberty, and hence by the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> of the sixteenth century, but even today, by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> critics the most opposed to the cruel <a href="../cathen/12376b.htm">predestinationism</a> of <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> who father that <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>. A technical study would be out of place here; it will be sufficient to enunciate the most salient thoughts, to enable the reader to find his bearings.</p>

<p>(1) It is regarded as incontestable today that the system of Augustine was complete in his mind from the year 397 &#151; that is, from the beginning of his episcopate, when he wrote his answers to the "qu&aelig;stiones Divers&aelig;" of Simplician. It is to this book that Augustine, in his last years, refers the <a href="../cathen/13703a.htm">Semipelagians</a> for the explanation of his real thought. This important fact, to which for a long time no attention was paid, has been recognized by Neander and established by Gangaut, and also by recent critics, such as Loofs, Reuter, Turmel, Jules Martin (see also Cunningham, St. Austin, 1886, pp. 80 and 175). It will not, therefore, be possible to deny the authority of these texts on the pretext that Augustine in his old age adopted a system more antagonistic to liberty.</p>

<p>(2) The system of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> can today be better understood than heretofore. <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> doubtless denied <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and integrity of Adam; in a word, the whole <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a>. But the parent <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of his system, which was of stoic origin, was nothing else than the complete "emancipation" of human liberty with regard to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and its limitless power for good and for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. It depended on man to attain by himself, without the <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace of God</a>, a stoic impeccability and even insensibility, or the absolute control of his passions. It was scarcely suspected, even up to our time, what frightful rigorism resulted from this exaggeration of the powers of liberty. Since perfection was possible, it was of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. There was no longer any distinction between <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> and counsels. Whatever was good was a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. There was no longer any distinction between mortal and venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Every useless word merited <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and even excluded from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. All this has been established by hitherto unedited documents which Caspari has published (Briefe, Abhandlungen, und Predigten, Christiania, 1890).</p>

<p>(3) The system of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> in opposition to this rests on three fundamental principles:</p>

<ul><li><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is absolute Master, by His grace, of all the determinations of the will; <li>man remains free, even under the action of grace; <li>the reconciliation of these two <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> rests on the manner of the Divine government.</ul>

<h3>Absolute sovereignty of God over the will</h3>

<p>This principle, in opposition to the emancipation of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>, has not always been understood in its entire significance. We think that numberless texts of the holy Doctor signify that not only does every meritorious act require <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> grace, but also that every act of virtue, even of <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidels</a>, should be ascribed to a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">Gift of God</a>, not indeed to a <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">supernatural grace</a> (as <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> pretend), but to a specially efficacious providence which has prepared this good movement of the will (Retractations, I, ix, n. 6). It is not, as <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> very wisely remark, that the will <em>cannot</em> accomplish that act of natural virtue, but it is a fact that without this providential benefit it <em>would not</em>. Many misunderstandings have arisen because this principle has not been comprehended, and in particular the great <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, which adopted it and made it the basis of its system of liberty, has not been justly appreciated. But many have been afraid of these affirmations which are so sweeping, because they have not grasped the nature of <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">God's gift</a>, which leaves freedom intact. The fact has been too much lost sight of that Augustine distinguishes very explicitly two orders of grace: the grace of natural virtues (the simple gift of Providence, which prepares efficacious motives for the will); and grace for salutary and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> acts, given with the first preludes of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The latter is the grace of the sons, <em>gratia fliorum</em>; the former is the grace of all men, a grace which even strangers and <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidels</a> (<em>filii concubinarum</em>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> says) can receive (De Patienti&acirc;, xxvii, n. 28).</p>
<h3>Man remains free, even under the action of grace</h3>

<p>The second principle, the affirmation of liberty even under the action of efficacious grace, has always been safeguarded, and there is not one of his anti-Pelagian works even of the latest, which does not <em>positively</em> proclaim a complete power of choice in man; "not but what it does not depend on the free choice of the will to embrace the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or reject it, but in the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> this will is prepared by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (De Pr&aelig;dest. SS., n. 10). The great Doctor did not reproach the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> with requiring a power to choose between <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; in fact he proclaims with them that without that power there is no responsibility, no merit, no demerit; but he reproaches them with exaggerating this power. <a href="../cathen/08557b.htm">Julian of Eclanum</a>, denying the sway of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, conceives <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> as a balance in perfect equilibrium. Augustine protests: this absolute equilibrium existed in Adam; it was destroyed after <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>; the will has to struggle and react against an inclination to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but it remains mistress of its choice (<em>Opus imperfectum contra Julianum</em>, III, cxvii). Thus, when he says that we have lost freedom in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of Adam, he is careful to explain that this lost freedom is not the liberty of choosing between <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, because without it we could not help <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, but the perfect liberty which was calm and <em>without struggle</em>, and which was enjoyed by Adam in virtue of his original integrity.</p>
<h3>The reconciliation of these two truths</h3>

<p>But is there not between these two principles an irremediable antinomy? On the one hand, there is affirmed an absolute and unreserved power in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of directing the choice of our will, of converting every hardened sinner, or of letting every created will harden itself; and on the other hand, it is affirmed that the rejection or acceptance of grace or of temptation depends on our <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. Is not this a contradiction? Very many modern critics, among whom are Loofs and Harnack, have considered these two affirmations as irreconcilable. But it is because, according to them, Augustinian grace is an irresistible impulse given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, just as in the absence of it every temptation inevitably overcomes the will. But in reality all antinomy disappears if we have the key of the system; and this key is found in the third principle: the Augustinian explanation of the Divine government of wills, a theory so original, so profound, and yet absolutely unknown to the most perspicacious critics, Harnack, Loofs, and the rest.</p>

<p>Here are the main lines of this theory: The will never decides without a motive, without the attraction of some good which it perceives in the object. Now, although the will may be free in presence of every motive, still, as a matter of fact it takes different resolutions according to the different motives presented to it. In that is the whole secret of the influence exercised, for instance, by eloquence (the orator can do no more than present motives), by meditation, or by good reading. What a power over the will would not a man possess who could, at his own pleasure, at any moment, and in the most striking manner, present this or the other motive of action? &#151; But such is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> privilege. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> has remarked that <em>man is not the master of his first thoughts</em>; he can exert an influence on the course of his reflections, but he himself cannot determine the objects, the images, and, consequently, the motives which present themselves to his mind. Now, as chance is only a word, it is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who determines at His pleasure these first perceptions of men, either by the prepared providential action of exterior causes, or interiorly by a Divine illumination given to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. &#151; let us take one last step with Augustine: Not only does <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> send at His pleasure those attractive motives which inspire the will with its determinations, but, before choosing between these illuminations of the natural and the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a>, <em><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> knows the response which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, with all freedom, will make to each of them</em>. Thus, in the Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, there is for each created will an indefinite series of motives which <em>de facto</em> (but very freely) win the consent to what is good. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, can, at His pleasure, obtain the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of Judas, if He wishes, or let Peter go down to perdition. No freedom, as a matter of fact, will resist what He has planned, although it always keeps the power of going to perdition. Consequently, it is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, in His perfect independence, who determines, by the choice of such a motive or such an inspiration (of which he knows the future influence), whether the will is going to decide for good or for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Hence, the man who has acted well must thank <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for having sent him an inspiration which was foreseen to be efficacious, while that favour has been denied to another. <em>A fortiori</em>, every one of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> owes it to the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> alone that he has received a series of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saw to be infallibly, though freely, bound up with <a href="../cathen/11711a.htm">final perseverance</a>.</p>

<p>Assuredly we may reject this theory, for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which always maintains the two principles of the absolute dependence of the will and of freedom, has not yet adopted as its own this reconciliation of the two extremes. We may ask where and how <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> knows the effect of these <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>. Augustine has always affirmed the fact; he has never inquired about the mode; and it is here that <a href="../cathen/10437a.htm">Molinism</a> has added to and developed his thoughts, in attempting to answer this question. But can the thinker, who created and until his dying day maintained this system which is so <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> concatenated, be accused of fatalism and <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ism</a>?</p>

<p>It remains to be shown that our interpretation exactly reproduces the thought of the great Doctor. The texts are too numerous and too long to be reproduced here. But there is one work of Augustine, dating from the year 397, in which he clearly explains his thought &#151; a work which he not only did not disavow later on, but to which in particular he referred, at the end of his career, those of his readers who were troubled by his constant affirmation of grace. For example, to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Adrumetum who thought that liberty was irreconcilable with this affirmation, he addressed a copy of this book "De Diversis qu&aelig;stionibus ad Simplicianum," feeling sure that their <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> would be dissipated. There, in fact, he formulates his thoughts with great clearness. Simplician had asked how he should understand the Epistle to the Romans 9, on the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> and <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>. Augustine first lays down the fundamental principle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, that <em>every good will comes from grace</em>, so that no man can take glory to himself for his merits, and this grace is so sure of its results that human liberty will never in reality resist it, although it has the power to do so. Then he affirms that this <em>efficacious</em> grace is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <em>for us to be able to act well</em>, but because, in fact, without it <em>we would not wish to act well</em>. From that arises the great difficulty: How does the power of resisting grace fit in with the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of the result? And it is here that Augustine replies: There are many ways of inviting <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Souls being differently disposed, <em><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> knows what invitation will be accepted</em>, what other will not be accepted. Only those are the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> for whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> chooses the invitation which is foreseen to be efficacious, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could convert them all: "Cujus autem miseretur, sic cum vocat, quomodo scit ei congruere ut vocantem non respuat" (op. cit., I, q. ii, n. 2, 12, 13).</p>

<p>Is there in this a vestige of an <em>irresistible grace</em> or of that impulse against which <em>it is impossible to fight</em>, forcing some to good, and others to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>? It cannot be too often repeated that this is not an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> flung off in passing, but a fundamental explanation which if not understood leaves us in the impossibility of grasping anything of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>; but if it is seized Augustine entertains no feelings of uneasiness on the score of freedom. In fact he supposes freedom everywhere, and reverts incessantly to that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> part which precedes <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, directs it, and assures its infallible result. In the "De Done perseveranti&aelig;" (xvii, n. 42), written at the end of his life, he explains the whole of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> by the choice of the vocation which is foreseen as efficacious. Thus is explained the chief part attributed to that external providence which prepares, by ill health, by warnings, etc., the good thoughts which it knows will bring about good resolutions. Finally, this explanation alone harmonizes with the moral action which he attributes to victorious grace. Nowhere does Augustine represent it as an irresistible impulse impressed by the stronger on the weaker. It is always an appeal, an invitation which attracts and seeks to persuade. He describes this attraction, which is without <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, under the graceful image of dainties offered to a child, green leaves offered to a sheep (In Joannem, tract. xxvi, n. 5). And always the infallibility of the result is assured by the Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which directs the choice of the invitation.</p>

<p>(4) The Augustinian <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> presents no new difficulty if one has understood the function of this Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the choice of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>. The problem is reduced to this: Does <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in his creative <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> and, before any act of human liberty, determine by an immutable choice the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> and the reprobate? &#151; Must the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> during <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> thank <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only for having rewarded their merits, or must they also thank Him for having, prior to any merit on their part, chosen them to the meriting of this reward? One system, that of the <a href="../cathen/13703a.htm">Semipelagians</a>, decides in favour of man: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestines</a> to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> all alike, and gives to all <em>an equal measure of grace</em>; human liberty alone decides whether one is lost or saved; from which we must <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> conclude (and they really insinuated it) that the number of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> is not fixed or certain. The opposite system, that of the <a href="../cathen/12376b.htm">Predestinationists</a> (the <a href="../cathen/13703a.htm">Semipelagians</a> falsely ascribed this view to the Doctor of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>), affirms not only a privileged choice of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but at the same time (a) the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of the reprobate to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and (b) the absolute powerlessness of one or the other to escape from the <em>irresistible impulse</em> which drags them either to good or to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. This is the system of <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>.</p>

<p>Between these two extreme opinions Augustine formulated (not invented) the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, which affirms these two <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> at the same time:</p>

<ul><li>the eternal choice of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is very real, very gratuitous, and constitutes the grace of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>; <li>but this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> does not destroy the Divine will to save all men, which, moreover, is not realized except by the human liberty that leaves to the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> full power to fall and to the non-elect full power to rise.</ul>

<p>Here is how the theory of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, already explained, forces us to conceive of the Divine <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>: Before all decision to create the world, the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> presents to Him all the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, and different series of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, which He can prepare for each <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, along with the consent or refusal which would follow in each circumstance, and that in millions and millions of possible combinations. Thus He sees that if Peter had received such another grace, he would not have been converted; and if on the contrary such another Divine appeal had been heard in the heart of Judas, he would have done penance and been saved. Thus, for each man in particular there are in the thought of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, limitless possible histories, some histories of virtue and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, others of crime and damnation; and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be free in choosing such a world, such a series of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, and in determining the future history and final destiny of each <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And this is precisely what He does when, among all possible worlds, by an absolutely <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a>, He decides to realize the actual world with all the circumstances of its historic evolutions, with all the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> which in fact have been and will be distributed until the end of the world, and consequently with all the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> and all the reprobate who <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foresaw would be in it if <em>de facto</em> He created it.</p>

<p>Now in the Divine <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, according to Augustine, and according to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> on this point, which has been formulated by him, the two elements pointed out above appear:</p>

<ul><li>The certain and gratuitous choice of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> &#151; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> decreeing, indeed, to create the world and to give it such a series of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> with such a concatenation of circumstances as should bring about freely, but infallibly, such and such results (for example, the despair of Judas and the repentance of Peter), decides, at the same time, the name, the place, the number of the citizens of the future heavenly <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The choice is immutable; the list closed. It is evident, indeed, that only those of whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> knows beforehand that they will wish to co-operate with the grace decreed by Him will be saved. It is a <em>gratuitous</em> choice, the gift of gifts, in virtue of which even our merits are a gratuitous benefit, a gift which precedes all our merits. No one, in fact, is able to merit this election. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could, among other possible worlds, have chosen one in which other series of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> would have brought about other results. He saw combinations in which Peter would have been impenitent and Judas converted. It is therefore <em>prior</em> to any merit of Peter, or any fault of Judas, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> decided to give them the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> which saved Peter and not Judas. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not wish to give <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a> <em>gratuitously</em> to any one; but He gives <em>very gratuitously</em> to Peter the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> with which He knows Peter will be saved. &#151; Mysterious choice! Not that it interferes with liberty, but because to this question: Why did not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seeing that another grace would have saved Judas, give it to him? Faith can only answer, with Augustine: O Mystery! O Altitudo! (De Spiritu et litter&acirc;, xxxiv, n. 60). <li>But this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> includes also the second element of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>: the very sincere will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to give to all men the power of saving themselves and the power of damning themselves. According to Augustine, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in his creative <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, has expressly excluded every order of things in which grace would deprive man of his liberty, every situation in which man would not have the power to resist <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and thus Augustine brushes aside that <a href="../cathen/12376b.htm">predestinationism</a> which has been attributed to him. Listen to him speaking to the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>: "All can be saved if they wish"; and in his "Retractations" (I, x), far from correcting this assertion, he confirms it emphatically: "It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, entirely <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that all men can, if they wish." But he always goes back to the providential preparation. In his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> he says to all: "It depends on you to be elect" (In Ps. cxx, n. 11, etc.); "Who are the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>? You, if you wish it" (In Ps. lxxiii, n. 5). But, you will say, according to Augustine, the lists of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> and reprobate are closed. Now if the non-elect <em>can</em> gain <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, if all the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> <em>can</em> be lost, why should not some pass from one list to the other? You forget the celebrated explanation of Augustine: When <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made His plan, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <em>infallibly</em>, before His choice, what would be the response of the wills of men to His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>. If, then, the lists are definitive, if no one will pass from one series to the other, it is not because <em>anyone cannot</em> (on the contrary, all can), it is because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> with infallible <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that <em>no one would wish to</em>. Thus I cannot effect that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">destine</a> me to another series of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> than that which He has fixed, but, with this grace, if I do not save myself it will not be because I am not able, but because I do not wish to. </ul>

<p>Such are the two essential elements of Augustinian and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. This is the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> common to all the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and formulated by all <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>: <em><a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> in its entirety is absolutely gratuitous (ante merita)</em>. We have to insist on this, because many have seen in this immutable and gratuitous choice only a hard thesis peculiar to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, whereas it is pure <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> (barring the mode of conciliation, which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> still leaves free). With that established, the long debates of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> on special <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> to glory <em>ante</em> or <em>post merita</em> are far from having the importance that some attach to them. (For a fuller treatment of this subtile problem see the "Dict. de th&eacute;ol. cath., I, coll. 2402 sqq.) I do not think <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> entered that debate; in his time, only <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> was in question. But it does not seem historically permissible to maintain, as many writers have, that Augustine first taught the milder system (<em>post merita</em>), up to the year 416 (<a href="../fathers/1701012.htm">Tractate 12 on the Gospel of John, no. 12</a>) and that afterwards, towards 418, he shifted his ground and went to the extreme of harsh assertion, amounting even to <a href="../cathen/12376b.htm">predestinationism</a>. We repeat, the facts absolutely refute this view. The ancient texts, even of 397, are as affirmative and as categorical as those of his last years, as critics like Loofs and Reuter* have shown. If, therefore, it is shown that at that time he inclined to the milder opinion, there is no reason to think that he did not persevere in that sentiment.</p>

<p>(5) The part which Augustine had in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">Original Sin</a> has been brought to light and determined only recently.</p>

<p>In the first place, It is no longer possible to maintain seriously, as was formerly the fashion (even among certain <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, like Richard Simon), that Augustine invented in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the hitherto unknown <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, or at least was the first to introduce the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of punishment and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Dorner himself (Augustinus, p. 146) disposed of this assertion, which lacks verisimilitude. In this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the primal fall Augustine distinguished, with greater insistency and clearness than his predecessors, the <em>punishment</em> and the <em><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></em> &#151; the chastisement which strips the children of Adam of all the original privileges &#151; and the fault, which consists in this, that the crime of Adam, the cause of the fall is, without having been committed personally by his children, nevertheless in a certain measure imputed to them, in virtue of the moral union established by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> between the head of the human <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and his descendants.</p>

<p>To pretend that in this matter Augustine was an innovator, and that before him the Fathers affirmed the punishment of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of Adam in his sons, but did not speak of the fault, is a historical <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> now <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to demonstration. We may discuss the thought of this or that pre Augustinian Father, but, taking them as a whole, there is no room for <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> R. Seeberg (Lehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte, I, p. 256), after the example of many others, proclaims it by referring to <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, Commodian, <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, and St. Ambrose. The expressions, <em>fault, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, stain (culpa, peccatum, macula)</em> are repeated in a way to dispel all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is that <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, while being <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is of a nature essentially different from other faults, and does not exact a <em>personal act</em> of the will of the children of Adam in order to be responsible for the fault of their father, which is morally imputed to them. Consequently, the Fathers &#151; the Greeks especially &#151; have insisted on its penal and afflictive character, which is most in evidence, while Augustine was led by the polemics of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> (and only by them) to lay emphasis on the moral aspect of the fault of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> in its first father.</p>

<p>With regard to Adam's state before the fall Augustine not only affirmed, against <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>, the gifts of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, impassibility, integrity, freedom from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and, above all, the <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> of Divine adoption, but he emphasized its absolutely gratuitous and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> character. Doubtless, considering the matter historically and <em>de facto</em>, it was only the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of Adam that inflicted death on us &#151; Augustine repeats it again and again &#151; because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had safeguarded us against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of our nature. But <em>de jure</em> neither <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> nor the other <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> were our due, and Augustine recognized this in affirming that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could have made the condition in which we were actually born the primitive condition of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parents</a>. That assertion alone is the very reverse of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>. It is, moreover, formally confirmed in the "Retractations" (I, ix, n. 6).</p>

<p>(6) Does this mean that we must praise everything in St. Augustine's explanation of grace? Certainly not. And we shall note the improvements made by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, through her <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, in the original Augustinism. Some exaggerations have been abandoned, as, for instance, the condemnation to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of children dying without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Obscure and ambiguous formul&aelig; have been eliminated. We must say frankly that Augustine's literary method of emphasizing his thought by exaggerated expressions, issuing in troublesome paradoxes, has often obscured his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, aroused opposition in many minds, or led them into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Also, it is above all important, in order to comprehend his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, to compile an Augustinian dictionary, not <em>a priori</em>, but after an objective study of his texts. The work would be long and laborious, but how many prejudices it would dispel!</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> historian Ph. Schaff (St. Augustine, p. 102) writes: "The great genius of the African Church, from whom the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> have received an impulse alike powerful, though in different directions, has not yet fulfilled the work marked out for him in the counsels of Divine Wisdom. He serves as a bond of union between the two antagonistic sections of <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Christendom</a>, and encourages the hope that a time may come when the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> and bitterness of strife will be forgiven and forgotten, and the discords of the past be drowned forever in the sweet harmonies of perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>." May this dream be realized!</p>

<h2 id="iii">Augustinism in history</h2>

<p>The influence of the Doctor of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> has been so exceptional in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that, after having indicated its general characteristics (see above), it is proper to indicate the principal phases of the historical development of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. The word <em>Augustinism</em> designates at times the entire group of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> doctrines of Augustine, at others, it is restricted to his system of grace. Hence, (1) <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> Augustinism; (2) <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> Augustinism on grace; (3) <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which governed the mitigation of Augustinism.</p>
<h3 id="A">Philosophical Augustinism</h3>

<p>In the history of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> Augustinism we may distinguish three very distinct phases. First, the period of its almost exclusive triumph in the West, up to the thirteenth century. During the long ages which were darkened by the invasion of the barbarians, but which were nevertheless burdened with the responsibility of safeguarding the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> of the future, we may say that Augustine was the Great Master of the West. He was absolutely without a rival, or if there was one, it was one of his disciples, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a>, who, after being formed in his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, popularized his theories. The r&ocirc;le of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, who engrafted <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonism</a> on the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the East, was that of Augustine in the West, with the difference, however, that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> was better able to detach the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonism</a> from the dreams of Oriental <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. Hence, a current of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> was started which will never cease to act upon Western thought. This influence shows itself in various ways. It is found in the compilers of this period, who are so numerous and so well deserving of recognition &#151; such as Isidore, <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> &#151; who drew abundantly from the works of Augustine, just as did the preachers of the sixth century, and notably St. C&aelig;sarius. In the controversies, especially in the great disputes of the ninth and twelfth centuries on the validity of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">Simoniacal</a> ordinations, the text of Augustine plays the principal part. Carl Mirbt has published on this point a very interesting study: "Die Stellung Augustins in der Publizistik des gregorianischen Kirchenstreits" (Leipzig, 1888). In the pre-Thomistic period of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>, then in process of formation, namely, from Anselm to <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albert the Great</a>, Augustine is the great inspirer of all the masters, such as Anselm, <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a>, <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugo of St. Victor</a>, who is called by his contemporaries, another Augustine, or even the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Augustine. And it is proper to remark, with Cunningham (Saint Austin, p. 178), that from the time of Anselm the cult of Augustinian <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> exercised an enormous influence on English thought in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. As regards <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, his Sentences are little else than an effort to synthesize the Augustinian theories.</p>

<p>While they do not form a system as rigidly bound together as <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomism</a>, yet Father Mandonnet (in his learned study of <a href="../cathen/13784a.htm">Siger de Brabant</a>) and M. de Wulf (on Gilles de Lessines) have been able to group these theories together. And here let us present a summary sketch of those theses regarded in the thirteenth century as Augustinian, and over which the battle was fought. First, the fusion of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and philosophy; the preference given to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> over <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> &#151; the latter representing <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a>, which was mistrusted, whilst the <a href="../cathen/07634a.htm">idealism</a> of Plate exerted a strong attraction &#151; wisdom regarded rather as the philosophy of the Good than the philosophy of the True. As a consequence, the disciples of Augustine always have a pronounced tinge of <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>, while the disciples of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> may be recognized by their very accentuated intellectualism. In <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a> the illuminating and immediate action of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the origin of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (at times it is pure ontologism); and the faculties of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are made substantially identical with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself. They are its functions, and not distinct entities (a thesis which was to keep its own partisans in the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> of the future and to be adopted by <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a>); the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a substance even without the body, so that after death, it is truly a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. In <a href="../cathen/04413a.htm">cosmology</a>, besides the celebrated thesis of <em>rationes seminales</em>, which some have recently attempted to interpret in favour of evolutionism, Augustinism admitted the multiplicity of substantial forms in compound beings, especially in man. But especially in the impossibility of creation <em>ab &aelig;terno</em>, or the essentially temporal character of every creature which is subject to change, we have one of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of Augustine which his disciples defended with greater constancy and, it would appear, with greater success.</p>

<p>A second period of very active struggles came in the thirteenth century, and this has only lately been recognized. Renan (Averroes, p. 259) and others believed that the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomism</a>, which was just then beginning, was caused by the infatuation of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> for <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroism</a>; but if the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> showed itself on the whole opposed to <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, it was simply from a certain horror at <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> innovations and at the neglect of Augustinism. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> revolution brought about by <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albert the Great</a> and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a> in favour of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> startled the old School of Augustinism among the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> as well as among the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, but especially among the latter, who were the disciples of the eminent Augustinian doctor, <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>. This will explain the condemnations, hitherto little understood, of many propositions of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> three years after his death, on the 7th of March, 1277, by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and on the 18th of March, 1277, by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, <a href="../cathen/08644a.htm">Robert Kilwardby</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>. The Augustinian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> represented tradition; <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomism</a>, progress. The censure of 1277 was the last victory of a too rigid Augustinism. The <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> fusion of the two methods in the two orders of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> little by little brought about an agreement on certain points without excluding differences on others which were yet obscure (as, for instance, the unity or the multiplicity of forms), at the same time that it made for progress in all the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of St. Thomas caused the withdrawal of the condemnations of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (14 February, 1325). Moreover, the wisdom or the moderation of the new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> contributed powerfully to its triumph. <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albert the Great</a> and St. Thomas, far from being adversaries of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, as they were reported to be, placed themselves in his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and while modifying certain theories, took over into their system the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the African <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. How many articles in the "Summa" of St. Thomas have no other object than to incorporate in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> this or the other theory which was cherished by St. Augustine (to take only one example, that of exemplar <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>). Hence, there was no longer any <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> strictly Augustinian, because every <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was such. They all eliminated certain special points and retained the same veneration for the master.</p>

<p>From the third period of the fifteenth century to our days we see less of the special progress of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> Augustinism than certain tendencies of an exaggerated revival of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonism</a>. In the fifteenth century <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Bessarion</a> (1472) and Marsilio Ficino (1499) used Augustine's name for the purpose of <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroning</a> Plato in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and excluding <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>. In the seventeenth century it is impossible to deny certain resemblances between <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Cartesianism</a> and the philosophy of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>. <a href="../cathen/09568a.htm">Malebranche</a> was wrong in ascribing his own ontologism to the great Doctor, as were also many of his successors in the nineteenth century.</p>
<h3 id="B">Theological Augustinism</h3>

<p>The history of Augustine's system of grace seems to blend almost indistinguishably with the progressive developments of this <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. Here it must suffice, first, to enumerate the principal phases; secondly, to trace the general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of development which mitigated Augustinism in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>After the death of Augustine, a whole century of fierce contests (430-529) ended in the triumph of fierce contests (430-529) ended in the triumph of moderate Augustinism. In vain had Pope St. Celestine (431) sanctioned the teachings of the Doctor of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13703a.htm">Semipelagians</a> of the south of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> could not understand the predilection of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, and in order to attack the works of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> they made use of the occasionally exaggerated formul&aelig; of <a href="../cathen/06315a.htm">St. Fulgentius</a>, or of the real <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of certain isolated <a href="../cathen/12376b.htm">predestinationists</a>, as, for example, Lucidus, who was condemned in the <a href="../cathen/01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a> (475). Happily, Prosper of Aquitaine, by his moderation, and also the unknown author of "De Vocatione omnium gentium," by his consoling thesis on the appeal addressed to all, opened the way to an agreement. And finally, St. C&aelig;sarius of Arles obtained from <a href="../cathen/06031a.htm">Pope Felix IV</a> a series of <em>Capitula</em> which were solemnly <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> at Orange, and gave their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> to the triumph of Augustinism (529). In the ninth century, a new victory was gained over the <a href="../cathen/12376b.htm">predestinationism</a> of <a href="../cathen/06682a.htm">Gottschalk</a> in the assemblies of Savonni&eacute;res and Toucy (859-860). The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Divine will to save all men and the universality of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> was thus <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the public teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> these two <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> are developed by the great <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctors of the Church</a>. Faithful to the principles of Augustinism, they place in especial relief his theory on <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, which prepares at its pleasure the determinations of the will by exterior events and interior inspirations.</p>

<p>In the fourteenth century a strong current of <a href="../cathen/12376b.htm">predestinationism</a> is evident. Today it is admitted that the origin of this tendency goes back to Thomas Bradwardin, a celebrated professor of Oxford, who died <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> (1349), and whom the best critics, along with Loofs and Harnack, recognize to have been the inspirer of <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a> himself. His book "De caus&acirc; Dei contra Pelagium" gave rise in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to disputes on Augustinian "predetermination," a word which, it had been thought, was invented by Banes in the sixteenth century. In spite of the opposition of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of absolute determinism in the name of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> was adopted by <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a> (1324-87), who formulated his universal fatalism, the necessity of good for the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> and of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for the rest. He fancied that he found in the Augustinian <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> the strange conception which became for him a central <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that overthrew all morality and all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>, and even civil, government. According as one is <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> or not, everything changes its nature. The same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are mortal in the non-elect which are venial in the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a>. The same acts of virtue are meritorious <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a>, even if he be actually a wicked man which are of no value in the non-elect. The <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> administered by one who is not <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> are always invalid; more than that, no <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> exists in a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, even a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, if he be not <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a>. In the same way, there is no power, even civil or political, in a prince who is not one of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, and no right of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in the sinner or the non elect. Such is the basis on which <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a> established the communism which aroused the socialist mobs in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. It is incontestable that he was fond of quoting Augustine as his authority; and his disciples, as we are assured by <a href="../cathen/10764a.htm">Thomas Netter Waldensis</a> (Doctrinale, I, xxxiv, &#167; 5), were continually boasting of the profound <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of their great Doctor, whom they called with emphasis "John of Augustine," Shirley, in his introduction to "Zizaniorum Fasciculi," has even pretended that the theories of <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a> on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, on the Incarnation, and even on <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, were the purest Augustinian inspiration, but even a superficial comparison, if this were the place to make it, would show how baseless such an assertion is. In the sixteenth century the heritage of <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a> and <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">Hus</a>, his disciple, was always accepted in the name of Augustinism by the leaders of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">Divine predestination</a> from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> separating the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, who were to be snatched out of the mass of perdition, from the reprobate who were destined to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, as well as the <em>irresistible</em> impulse of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> drawing some to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and others to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> &#151; such was the fundamental <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> even adopted a system which was "logically more consistent, but practically more revolting," as Schaff puts it (St. Augustine, p. 104), by which the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of reprobation of the non-elect would be independent of the fall of Adam and of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> (Supralapsarianism). It was certain that these harsh doctrines would bring their reaction, and in spite of the severities of the Synod of Dordrecht, which it would be interesting to compare with the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> in the matter of moderation, <a href="../cathen/01740c.htm">Arminianism</a> triumphed over the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> thesis.</p>

<p>We must note here that even <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> critics, with a loyalty which does them <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, have in these latter times vindicated Augustine from the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> interpretations of <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>. Dorner, in his "Gesch. der prot. Th&eacute;ologie," had already shown the instinctive repugnance of <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> to the horrible theories of <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>. W. Cunningham (Saint Austin, p. 82 sqq.) has very frankly called attention to the complete <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> opposition on fundamental points which exists between the Doctor of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>. In the first place, as regards the state of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is, according to <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, totally depraved, for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> it is very difficult to grasp the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> conception of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> which, for <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, is not, as for us, the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> degradation and the stain imprinted on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of every son of Adam by the fault of the father which is imputable to each member of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. It is not the deprivation of grace and of all other super-natural gifts; it is not even <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, understood in the ordinary sense of the word, as the struggle of base and selfish <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instincts</a> against the virtuous tendencies of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; it is a profound and complete subversion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature'</a> it is the physical alteration of the very substance of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Our faculties, understanding, and will, if not entirely destroyed, are at least mutilated, powerless, and chained to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is not <em>a</em> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it is <em>the</em> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the permanent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, living in us and causing a continual stream of new <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to spring from our nature, which is radically corrupt and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For, as our being is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, every act of ours is equally <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Thus, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> do not ordinarily speak of <em>the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a></em> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, but only of <em>the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></em>, which makes us what we are and defiles everything. Hence arose the paradox of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>: that even in an act of perfect charity a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally, because he acts with a vitiated nature. Hence that other paradox: that this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can never be effaced, but remains entire, even after justification, although it will not be any longer imputed; to efface it, it would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to modify physically this human being which is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, without going so far as <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, has nevertheless insisted on this total corruption. "Let it stand, therefore, as an indubitable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which no engines can shake," says he (Institution II, v, &#167; 19), "that the mind of man is so entirely alienated from the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that he cannot conceive, desire, or design anything but what is weak, distorted, foul, impure or iniquitous, that his heart is so thoroughly environed by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that it can breathe out nothing but corruption and rottenness; that if some men occasionally make a show of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> their mind is ever interwoven with <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrisy</a> and deceit, their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> inwardly bound with the fetters of wickedness." "Now," says Cunningham, "this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, whatever there may be to be said for it, is not the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Saint Austin. He held that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the defect of a good nature which retains elements of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, even in its most diseased and corrupted state, and he gives no countenance, whatever to this modern opinion of total depravity." It is the same with <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin's</a> affirmation of the irresistible action of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on the will. Cunningham shows that these doctrines are irreconcilable with liberty and responsibility, whereas, on the contrary, "St. Austin is careful to attempt to harmonize the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">God's omnipotence</a> with human responsibility" (St. Austin, p. 86). The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> was therefore faithful to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> spirit of the African Doctor, and maintained pure Augustinism in the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, by Its definitions against the two opposite excesses. Against <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> it reaffirmed <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> and the absolute necessity of grace (Sess. VI, can. 2); against <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/12376b.htm">predestinationism</a> it proclaimed the freedom of man, with his double power of resisting grace (<em>posse dissentire si velit</em> &#151; Sess. VI, can. 4) and of doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, even before embracing the Faith (can. 6 and 7).</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> adopted, while modifying it, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> conception of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> and the state of fallen man. No more than <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> did the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> admit the two orders, natural and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>. All the gifts which Adam had received <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, integrity, <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> &#151; are absolutely required by the nature of man. <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">Original sin</a> is, therefore, again regarded as a profound alteration of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. From which the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> conclude that <em>the key to St. Augustine's system is to be found in the essential difference of the Divine government and of grace, before and after the Fall of Adam</em>. Before the Fall Adam enjoyed complete liberty, and grace gave him the power of resisting or obeying; after the Fall there was no longer in men liberty properly so called; there was only spontaneity (<em>libertas a coactione</em>, and not <em>libertas a necessitate</em>). Grace, or delectation in the good, is essentially efficacious, and necessarily victorious once it is superior in degree to the opposite <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. The struggle, which was prolonged for two centuries, led to a more profound study of the Doctor of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> and prepared the way for the definite triumph of Augustinism, but of an Augustinism mitigated in accordance with <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which we must now indicate.</p>
<h3 id="C">Laws which governed the mitigation of Augustinism</h3>

<p>In spite of what <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> critics may have said, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has always been faithful to the fundamental principles defended by Augustine against the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> and <a href="../cathen/13703a.htm">Semipelagians</a>, on <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, the necessity and gratuity of grace, the absolute dependence on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Nevertheless, great progress was made along the line of gradual mitigation. For it cannot be denied that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> formulated at <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>, and taught by all our <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, produces an impression of greater suavity and greater clarity than this or that passage in the works of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>. The causes of this softening down, and the successive phases of this progress were as follows:</p>

<ul> <li>First, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> began to distinguish more clearly between the natural order and the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, and hence the Fall of Adam no longer appeared as a corruption of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in its constituent parts; it is the loss of the whole order of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> elevation. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<a href="../summa/1085.htm#article1">Summa, I:85:1</a>) formulates the great law of the preservation, in guilty Adam's children, of all the faculties in their essential integrity: "Sin (even original) neither takes away nor diminishes the natural endowments." Thus the most rigorist <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a>, Alvarez, Lemos, <a href="../cathen/04330a.htm">Contenson</a>, agree with the great Doctor that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of Adam has not enfeebled (<em>intrinsece</em>) the natural moral forces of humanity. <li>Secondly, such consoling and fundamental <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> desire to save all men, and the redeeming death of Christ which was really offered and accepted for all peoples and all <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> &#151; these <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, which Augustine never denied, but which he left too much in the background and as it were hidden under the terrible formulas of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, have been placed in the full light, have been developed, and applied to <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidel</a> nations, and have at last entered into the ordinary teaching of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Thus our Doctors, without detracting in the least from the sovereignty and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have risen to the highest <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>: that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so sincerely desires the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all as to give absolutely to all, immediately or mediately, the means <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and always with the desire that man should consent to employ those means. No one falls into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> except by his own fault. Even <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidels</a> will be accountable for their <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidelity</a>. St. Thomas expresses the thought of all when he says: "It is the common teaching that if a man born among the barbarous and <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidel</a> nations really does what lies in his power, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will reveal to him what is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, either by interior inspirations or by sending him a preacher of the Faith" (In Lib. II Sententiarum, dist. 23, Q. viii, a.4, ad 4am). We must not dissemble the fact that this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> changes the whole aspect of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> had left it too much in the shade, insisting only upon the other aspect of the problem: namely, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while making a sufficing appeal to all, is nevertheless not bound to choose always that appeal which shall in fact be efficacious and shall be accepted, provided that the refusal of consent be due to the obstinacy of the sinner's will and not to its lack of power. Thus the Doctors most eagerly approved the axiom, <em>Facienti quod in se est Deus non denegat gratiam</em> &#151; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not refuse grace to one who does what he can. <li>Thirdly, from principles taught by Augustine consequences have been drawn which are clearly derived from them, but which he had not pointed out. Thus it is incontestably a principle of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> that no one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in an act which he cannot avoid &#151; "Quis enim peccat in eo quod caveri non potest?" This passage from "De libero arbitrio" (III, xviii, n. 50) is anterior to the year 395; but far from retracting it he approves and explains it, in 415, in the <a href="../fathers/1503.htm"><em>On Nature and Grace</em> 67, n. 80</a>. From that pregnant principle <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> have concluded, first, that grace sufficient to conquer <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> never fails anyone, even an <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidel</a>; then, against the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, they have added that, to deserve its name of <em>sufficient grace</em>, it ought to give a real power which is complete even relatively to the actual difficulties. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> have groped about, hesitated, even denied; but today there are very few who would dare not to recognize in St. Augustine the affirmation of the possibility of not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. <li>Fourthly, certain secondary assertions, which encumbered, but did not make part of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, have been lopped off from the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Augustine. Thus the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which, with Augustine, has always denied entrance into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> to unbaptized children, has not adopted the severity of the great Doctor in condemning such children to bodily pains, however slight. And little by little the milder teaching of St. Thomas was to prevail in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and was even to be vindicated against <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> censure when <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> condemned the <a href="../cathen/12116c.htm">pseudo-synod of Pistoja</a>. At last Augustine's obscure formul&aelig; were abandoned or corrected, so as to avoid regrettable confusions. Thus the expressions which seemed to identify <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> with <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> have given way to clearer formul&aelig; without departing from the real meaning which Augustine sought to express. </ul>

<p>Discussion, however, is not yet ended within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. On most of those points which concern especially the manner of the Divine action <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> and <a href="../cathen/10437a.htm">Molinists</a> disagree, the former holding out for an irresistible predetermination, the latter maintaining, with Augustine, a grace whose infallible efficacy is revealed by the Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But both of these views affirm the <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace of God</a> and the liberty of man. The lively controversies aroused by the "Concordia" of Molina (1588) and the long conferences <em>de auxiliis</em> held at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, before Popes <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>, are well known. There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that a majority of the theologian-consultors thought they discovered an opposition between Molina and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>. But their verdict was not approved, and (what is of great importance in the history of Augustinism) it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that they asked for the condemnation of doctrines which are today universally taught in all the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Thus, in the project of censure reproduced by Serry ("Historia Congregationis de Auxiliis," append., p. 166) the first proposition is this: "In statu natur&aelig; laps&aelig; potest homo, cum solo concursu generali Dei, efficere opus bonum morale, quod in ordine ad finem hominis naturalem sit ver&aelig; virtutis opus, referendo illud in Deum, sicut referri potest ac deberet in statu naturali" (In the state of fallen nature man can with only the general <em>concursus</em> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> do a good moral work which may be a work of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> virtue with regard to the natural end of man by referring it to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as it can and ought to be referred in the natural state). Thus they sought to condemn the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> held by all the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> (with the exception of <a href="../cathen/07018a.htm">Gregory of Rimini</a>), and sanctioned since then by the condemnation of Proposition lvii of <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a>. For a long time it was said that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had prepared a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> to condemn Molina; but today we learn from an autograph document of <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> that liberty was left to the two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> until a new Apostolic decision was given (Schneeman "Controversiarum de Div. grat., " 1881, p. 289). Soon after, a third interpretation of Augustinism was offered in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that of <a href="../cathen/11103a.htm">Noris</a>, Belleli, and other partisans of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">moral predetermination</a>. This system has been called <em>Augustinianism</em>. To this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> belong a number of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> who, with <a href="../cathen/14697c.htm">Thomassin</a>, essayed to explain the infallible action of grace without admitting either the <em>scientia media</em> of the <a href="../cathen/10437a.htm">Molinists</a> or the physical predetermination of the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a>. A detailed study of this interpretation of St. Augustine may be found in Vacant's "Dictionnaire de th&eacute;ologie catholique," I, cols. 2485-2501; here I can only mention one very important document, the last in which the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> has expressed its mind on the various theories of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> for reconciling grace and liberty. This is the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (13 July, 1748) which declares that the three <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> &#151; <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomist</a>, Augustinian (<a href="../cathen/11103a.htm">Noris</a>), and <a href="../cathen/10437a.htm">Molinist</a> &#151; have full right to defend their theories. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> concludes with these words: "This <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> favours the liberty of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; none of the systems proposed to reconcile the liberty of man with the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence of God</a> has been thus far condemned (op. cit., col. 2555).</p>

<p>In conclusion we must indicate briefly <em>the official authority which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> attributes to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> in the questions of grace</em>. Numerous and solemn are the eulogies of St. Augustine's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> pronounced by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. For instance, St. Gelasius I (1 November, 493), St. Hormisdas (13 August, 520), <a href="../cathen/02660a.htm">Boniface II</a> and the Fathers of Orange (529), <a href="../cathen/08421b.htm">John II</a> (534), and many others. But the most important document, that which ought to serve to interpret all the others, because it precedes and inspires them, is the celebrated letter of <a href="../cathen/03477c.htm">St. Celestine I</a> (431), in which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> guarantees not only the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of Augustine against his <a href="../cathen/04757a.htm">detractors</a>, but also the great merit of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>: "So great was his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that my predecessors have always placed him in the rank of the masters," etc. This letter is accompanied by a series of ten dogmatic <em>capitula</em> the origin of which is uncertain, but which have always been regarded, at least since Pope Hormisdas, as expressing the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Now these extracts from <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">African councils</a> and pontifical decisions end with this restriction: "As to the questions which are more profound and difficult, and which have given rise to these controversies, we do not think it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to impose the solution of them." &#151; In presence of these documents emanating from so high a source, ought we to say that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has adopted all the teaching of St. Augustine on grace so that it is never permissible to depart from that teaching? Three answers have been given:</p>

<ul><li>For some, the authority of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> is absolute and irrefragable. The <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> went so far as to formulate, with Havermans, this proposition, condemned by <a href="../cathen/01295a.htm">Alexander VIII</a> (7 December, 1690): "Ubi quis invenerit doctrinam in Augustino clare fundatam, illam absolute potest tenere et docere, non respiciendo ad ullam pontificis bullam" (Where one has found a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> clearly based on <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, he can hold and teach it absolutely without referring to any pontifical <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>). This is inadmissible. None of the pontifical approbations has a meaning so absolute, and the <em>capitula</em> make an express reservation for the profound and difficult questions. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> themselves have permitted a departure from the thought of St. Augustine in the matter of the lot of children dying without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Auctorem Fidei," 28 August, 1794). <li>Others again have concluded that the eulogies in question are merely vague formul&aelig; leaving full liberty to withdraw from St. Augustine and to blame him on every point. Thus Launoy, Richard Simon, and others have maintained that Augustine had been in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> on the very gist of the problem, and had really taught <a href="../cathen/12376b.htm">predestinationism</a>. But that would imply that for fifteen centuries the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> took as its guide an adversary of its <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <li>We must conclude, with the greater number of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, that Augustine has a real <em>normative</em> authority, hedged about, however, with reserves and wise limitations. In the capital questions which constitute the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in those matters the Doctor of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> is truly the authoritative witness of tradition; for example, on the existence of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, the necessity of grace, at least for every salutary act; the gratuitousness of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift of God</a> which precedes all merit of man because it is the cause of it; the predilection for the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> and, on the other hand, the liberty of man and his responsibility for his transgressions. But the secondary problems, concerning the mode rather than the fact, are left by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to the prudent study of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. Thus all <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> unite in a great respect for the assertions of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>.</ul>

<p>At present this attitude of fidelity and respect is all the more remarkable as <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, who were formerly so bitter in defending the <a href="../cathen/12376b.htm">predestination</a> of <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, are today almost unanimous in rejecting what they themselves call "the boldest defiance ever given to reason and <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>" (Gr&eacute;tillat, "Dogmatique," III, p. 329). Schleiermacher, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, maintains it, but he adds to it the <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenist</a> theory of <a href="../cathen/01599a.htm">universal salvation by the final restoration of all creatures</a>, and he is followed in this by Farrar Lobstein, Pfister, and others. The <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> is today, especially in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, altogether abandoned, and often replaced by pure <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> (Beyschlag). But among <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> critics the best are drawing near to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interpretation of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, as, for example, Gr&eacute;tillat, in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and Stevens, Bruce, and Mozley (On the Augustinian Doctrine of Predestination), in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Sanday (Romans, p. 50) also declares the mystery to be unfathomable for man yet solved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: "And so our solution of the problem of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">Free-will</a>, and of the problems of history and of individual <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, must finally lie in the full acceptance and realization of what is implied by the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> and the <em>omniscience</em> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." These concluding words recall the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> system of Augustine and permit us to hope that at least on this question there may be a union of the two Churches in a wise Augustinism.</p>
