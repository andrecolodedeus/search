<h1>Temptation of Christ</h1>  

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> translation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, the word "temptation" is used in various senses, the principal of which are the following: <ul><li>the act of testing or trying (<a href="../bible/deu004.htm#vrs34">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>; <a href="../bible/tob002.htm#vrs12">Tobit 2:12</a>; <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#vrs28">Luke 22:28</a>; etc.); <li>enticement to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs41">Matthew 26:41</a>; <a href="../bible/1co010.htm#vrs13">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>; etc.); <li>the state of being tempted (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#vrs13">Matthew 6:13</a>; <a href="../bible/luk004.htm#vrs13">Luke 4:13</a>; etc.); <li>that which tempts or entices to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> (<a href="../bible/jam001.htm#vrs12">James 1:12</a>; <a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#vrs9">2 Peter 2:9</a>; etc.); <li>the name of a place (<a href="../bible/exo017.htm#vrs7">Exodus 17:7</a>; <a href="../bible/deu006.htm#vrs16">Deuteronomy 6:16</a>; etc.)</ul> Taken in an unfavourable sense as denoting enticement to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, temptation cannot be referred directly to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or to Christ, so that when we read in <a href="../bible/gen022.htm#vrs1">Genesis 22:1</a>, for instance, "God tempted Abraham", and in <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#vrs6">John 6:6</a>, "Hoc autem dicebat tentans eum", literally: "This He [<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>] said tempting him [Philip]", the expressions must be taken in the sense of testing, trying. According to St. James (<a href="../bible/jam001.htm#vrs12">1:12 sqq.</a>), the natural source of man's <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> is <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, or that proneness to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is the result of the fall of Adam, and which remains in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> regeneration, and even though the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in the state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs1">Romans 8:1</a>). Concupiscence becomes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> only when freely yielded to; when resisted with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help it is an occasion of merit. Together with inward <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, and outward creatures, which may be the <a href="../cathen/11196a.htm">occasion of sin</a> (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#vrs15">1 John 2:15 sqq.</a>), the chief cause of temptation is <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, "the tempter" (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#vrs3">Matthew 4:3</a>), bent on man's eternal ruin (<a href="../bible/eph006.htm#vrs10">Ephesians 6:10 sqq.</a>). In the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>, the clause "Lead us not into temptation" is an <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and trusting petition for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help to enable us to overcome temptation when His Fatherly Providence allows us to experience the allurements of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> and watchfulness are the chief weapons against temptation (<a href="../bible/mar014.htm#vrs38">Mark 14:38</a>; etc.). <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not allow man to be tempted beyond his strength (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#vrs13">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>).

<p>Like Adam, Christ (the second Adam) endured temptation only from without, inasmuch as His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was free from all <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>; but unlike Adam, He withstood the assaults of the Tempter on all points, thereby affording His mystical members a perfect model of resistance to their spiritual enemy, and a permanent source of victorious help (<a href="../bible/heb004.htm#vrs15">Hebrews 4:15-16</a>). In our <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">first three Gospels</a> (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#vrs1">Matthew 4:1-11</a>; <a href="../bible/mar001.htm#vrs12">Mark 1:12-13</a>; <a href="../bible/luk004.htm#vrs1">Luke 4:1-13</a>), the narrative of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> temptation is placed in immediate connexion with His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> on the one hand, and with the beginning of His public ministry on the other. The reason of this is clear. The <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptists</a> naturally regard the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ as the external designation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> from above for His <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> work to be pursued under the guidance of the Holy Spirit bestowed upon Him on this occasion; and they no less naturally regard <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sojourn in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> where He was tempted, as His own immediate preparation for that great work under the guidance of the same Holy Spirit. As our <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">first three Gospels</a> agree concerning the time to which they assign the temptation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so they are at one in ascribing the same general place to its occurrence, viz. "the desert", whereby they no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> mean the Wilderness of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, where <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> would indeed be, as St. Mark says: "with beasts". From St. Mark (<a href="../bible/mar001.htm#vrs13">1:13</a>) &#151; with whom compare <a href="../bible/luk004.htm#vrs2">Luke 4:2</a> &#151; we learn that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was tempted during the forty days which He spent in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, "Harmony of the Evangelists", II, xvi), so that the three onsets given in detail by St. Matthew and St. Luke are apparently the three final assaults of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> against Christ. The first of these assaults is directly connected in both St. Matthew and St. Luke with the prolonged fast of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in the wilderness. The Tempter suggested to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> that He should use His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> power to relieve His hunger, by changing into bread the loaf-like flints of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. The two other assaults are given in a different order, St. Matthew adhering probably to the order of time, and St. Luke to that of place. The spot pointed out by tradition as the summit from which <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> offered to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> dominion over all earthly kingdoms is the "Quarantania", a limestone peak on the road from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>. As regards the Temple's pinnacle from which the Tempter bade <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> cast Himself down, it was not the top of the House of <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a>, but probably the roof of Solomon's portico from which, at a later date, St. James was actually hurled to the pavement below (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.13</a>).

<p>According to <a href="../bible/luk004.htm#vrs13">St. Luke (4:13)</a>, after having subjected Christ to all kinds of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> &#151; the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> import of which is undoubted &#151; <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> withdrew, awaiting a favourable opportunity like that which followed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> prolonged fast in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. The later conflict thus alluded to is no other than that of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#vrs53">Luke 22:53</a>; <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs30">John 14:30</a>). The ministry of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, in connection with His temptation, is mentioned in <a href="../bible/mar001.htm#vrs13">Mark 1:13</a>. <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan's</a> exact manner of appearance to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is not stated by the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>. Despite the difficulties urged, chiefly by non-Catholic scholars, against the historical character of the three <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, as recorded by St. Matthew and St. Luke, it is plain that these sacred writers intended to describe an actual and visible approach of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, to chronicle an actual shifting of places, etc., and that the traditional view, which maintains the objective nature of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, is the only one meeting all the requirements of the Gospel narrative.
