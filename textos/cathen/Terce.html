<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Terce</h1>  

<p>The origin of Terce, like that of Sext and None, to which it bears a close relationship, dates back to Apostolic times. As has already been stated (see <a href="../cathen/11097a.htm">NONE</a>) according to an ancient custom of the Romans and Greeks, the day and night respectively were divided into four parts of about three hours each. The second division of the day hours was that of Terce from nine o'clock until midday. These divisions of the day were also in vogue among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> at the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> we find mention of the sixth hour in <a href="../bible/mat020.htm#vrs5">Matthew 20:5</a>; <a href="../bible/mat027.htm#vrs45">27:45</a>; <a href="../bible/mar015.htm#vrs33">Mark 15:33</a>; <a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs14">John 19:14</a>; of the ninth hour, in <a href="../bible/mat027.htm#vrs46">Matthew 27:46</a>; <a href="../bible/mar015.htm#vrs25">Mark 15:25</a>; the Holy Ghost descends upon the Apostles on the day of Pentecost at the third hour, <a href="../bible/act002.htm">Acts 2:15</a>. Some of these texts prove that these three hours were, in preference to others, chosen for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and probably also by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, from whom the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> appear to have borrowed the custom. We find frequent mention in the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers of the third century of Terce, Sext, and None as hours for daily <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. For example, <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, and the Canons of <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> (see Clement, &quot;Stromat.&quot;, VII, vii, in P.G., IX, 455-458). <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> says expressly that we should always <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and that there is no prescribed time for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, but adds: &quot;As regards the time, there should be no lax observation of certain hours--I mean, of those common hours which have long marked the divisions of the day, the third, the sixth, and the ninth--and which we may observe in Scripture to be more solemn than the rest&quot; (<a href="../fathers/0322.htm"><em>On Prayer</em> 25/a>).

<p>Clement and <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> in these passages refer only to private <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> at these three hours. The Canons of <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> also speak of these three hours as suitable for private <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. However, on the days called &quot;days of station&quot;, that is to say Wednesday and Friday, which were set apart as especially <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and Sunday, these hours were recited in public (Canon, xx, xxvi). <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> remarked that these three hours had been observed in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> should also observe them (De Oratione, XXXIV, in P.L., IV, 541). In the fourth century the custom of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> at these hours became more frequent, and even <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>, at least for <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> (see the texts of the Apostolic Constitutions, of St. Ephrem, of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, of the author of &quot;De Virginitate&quot; quoted in B&#228;umer-Biron, &quot;Histoire du br&eacute;viaire&quot;, 116, 121, 129, 186). Our texts say nothing as to what were the elements of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of Terce, Sext, or None before the fourth century. Doubtless, like all <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> at that time, they were composed of psalms, canticles, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a>. It is from the fourth century onwards that we can gather a more precise <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> as to the composition of the hour of Terce. In the fourth century, as we have said, the custom of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> at Terce spread, and tended to become <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>, at least for <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. There is no mention in the &quot;Peregrinatio ad Loca Sancta&quot; of an office of Terce on ordinary days. Some authors have misunderstood the text here, but there is no mention of a meeting at this hour, except on Sunday and during <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> (see Cabrol, &quot;Etude sur la Peregrinatio Silvi&aelig;&quot;, Paris, 1895, p. 45, 46). The hour of Terce is also mentioned in <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, &quot;Ep. ad L&aelig;tam.&quot; in P.L., XXII, 875; &quot;Ep. ad Eustoch.&quot; in P.L., XXII, 420; in the Life of <a href="../cathen/10154a.htm">St. Melania the Younger</a>, &quot;Analecta Bollandiana&quot;, VIII, 1889, p. 16; in Cassian, &quot;De institut. coenob.&quot;, in P.L., LXIX, 112, 126, etc.

<p>At this period it is composed of the same elements as the hours of Sext and None; the distribution is the same, and it is clear that the three &quot;little hours&quot; were composed at the same time and that they have the same origin. The psalms of Terce are different from those of the other two hours. There were also certain varieties of composition. Thus, in certain countries, three psalms were assigned to Terce, six to Sext, nine to None, in virtue of the symbolism.

<p>The composition varies also in the various <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> Terce is composed of two parts, each made up of psalms (two for the first, three for the second), with invitatory, troparia, and final <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. (See Neale and Littledale, &quot;Commentary on the Psalms&quot;, I, p. 34.) In the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Rite, Terce comprises, on week days, the <a href="../cathen/06718a.htm">Gradual Psalms</a>, 119, 120, and 121, with a capitulum, verse, Kyrie, Pater, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. On <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and Mondays the <a href="../cathen/06718a.htm">Gradual Psalms</a> are replaced by three octonaries (i.e. three sections of eight verses each) of Psalm cxviii. In the Mozarabic Rite, three octonaries of <a href="../bible/psa118.htm">Psalm 118</a> are also recited, the composition otherwise differing very little. In the main, the recitation of three psalms at Terce, as at the other two &quot;little hours&quot; of the day, is founded on a universal and very ancient tradition. Divergencies on this point are only exceptional. The practice of the Roman Liturgy, which at first sight appears to be somewhat different, may be traced to this tradition also. In this rite a part of <a href="../bible/psa118.htm">Psalm 118</a> is recited at Terce as well as at the other &quot;little hours&quot;, the psalm being divided into three double octonaries. After the new <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> arranged in 1911-12, the psalms are: on Sunday, <a href="../bible/psa118.htm">Psalm 118</a> (three divisions); on Monday, <a href="../bible/psa026.htm">Psalm 26</a> (two divisions); on Tuesday, <a href="../bible/psa039.htm">Psalm 39</a> (three divisions); on Wednesday, <a href="../bible/psa053.htm">Psalm 53</a> (two divisions); on Thursday, <a href="../bible/psa072.htm">Psalm 72</a> (three divisions); on Friday, <a href="../bible/psa039.htm">Psalm 39</a> (two divisions); on Saturday, <a href="../bible/psa101.htm">Psalm 101</a> (three divisions). The number three is therefore preserved in each case. The <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> &quot;Nunc Sancte nobis Spiritus&quot; recalls the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. The other elements are the same as for Sext and None.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgists</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> considered the hour of Terce as corresponding to the hour of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> condemnation to death. They also often point out on this occasion the mysteries of the number three, which in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> symbolism is a sacred number (see <a href="../cathen/02645b.htm">Bona</a>, loc. cit.). What gives it its especial dignity, however, is its association with the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles on the day of Pentecost at this very hour (&quot;seeing it is but the third hour of the day&quot;, <a href="../bible/act002.htm#vrs15">Acts 2:15</a>). In several <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, and particularly in the Roman, this connection is brought to mind by one or other of the formul&aelig;. Again, this is the reason why, from the earliest times, the hour of Terce was chosen as that of the Mass on feast days. Sometimes, also, this hour is called in <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language <em>hora aurea</em> or <em>hora sacra</em> (see Durandus, &quot;De rit. eccles.&quot;, c. viii).
