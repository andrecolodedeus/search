<h1>Terence Albert O'Brien</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, 1600; died there, 31 October, 1651. He joined the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, receiving the name Albert at <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, where his uncle, Maurice O'Brien, was then prior. In 1622 he studied at Toledo and after eight years returned to <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, to become twice prior there and once at Lorrha, and in 1643 <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of his order in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. His services to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Confederation were highly valued by the Supreme Council. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he received the degree of Master in Theology, and on his return made a visitation of two houses of his province at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, where it was reported that urban VIII was about to appoint him coadjutor to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Emly. He was again named for the coadjutorship by the Supreme Council at the end of 1645, and recommended by the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> <a href="../cathen/13061a.htm">Rinuccini</a>. Subsequently, at the petition of many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/13061a.htm">Rinuccini</a> wrote (17 March, 1646) that Burgat, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of Emly, was a suitable <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for the coadjutorship. In August he renewed his recommendation of Father Terence O'Brien, who was named coadjutor with the right of succession, in March, 1647, and eight months later was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/13061a.htm">Rinuccini</a>. Throughout the ensuing troubles he adhered to the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a>. He signed the declaration against Inchiquin's truce in 1648, and the declaration against Ormond in 1650. When Limerick was besieged in 1651, he urged a stubborn resistance and so embittered the Ormondists and the Parliamentarians, that in the capitulation he was excluded from quarter and protection. The day after the surrender, he with Major General Purcell and Father Wolf were discovered in the pest-house, brought before a court martial and ordered for execution, which took place on the following day.
