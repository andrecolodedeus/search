<h1>Teutonic Order</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military order</a> modelled on the <a href="../cathen/07477a.htm">Hospitallers of St. John</a>, which changed its residence as often as the latter. These residences, marking as many stages in its development, are: (1) Accon (Acre), its cradle in Palestine (1190-1309); (2) Marienburg, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, the centre of its temporal domination as a military principality (1309-1525); (3) Mergentheim in Franconia, which inherited its diminished possessions after the loss of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> (1524-1805); (4) finally, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, where the order has gathered the remains of its revenues and survives as a purely <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> order. A <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> branch likewise subsists in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>.

<p>(1) There was already a Teutonic <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08361a.htm">Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem</a>, with a church dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, who is still the patroness of the order and after whom the name Mariani is sometimes given to its members. But this establishment, which was under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Grand Master of St. John, was broken up at the conquest of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> by Saladin (1187). During the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section3">Third Crusade</a> German <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> from <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a> and L&#252;beck with the Duke of Holstein established a temporary <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> under the besieged walls of Acre; this was a large tent, constructed from the sails of their ships, in which the sick of their country were received (1190). After the capture of Acre this <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> was permanently established in the city with the co-operation of Frederick of Suabia, leader of the German <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, and at the same time religious <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> were attached to it for the defence of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. The Order of Teutonic Knights was founded and took its place beside the other two orders of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a>. As early as 1192 they were endowed by <a href="../cathen/03478b.htm">Celestine III</a> with the same privileges as the Order of St. John, whose <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> rule they adopted, and as the Order of the Temple, from which they borrowed their military organization. <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> in 1205 granted them the use of the white habit with a black cross. The emperors of the House of Suabia heaped favours upon them. Moreover, they took sides with <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> even after he had broken with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and in opposition to the other two <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military orders</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section4">Fourth Crusade</a>, when the gates of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> were for the last time opened to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, under the command of this emperor, the Teutonic Knights were able to take possession of their first house, St. Mary of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> (1229). But it was not for long and before the end of the century they left Palestine, which had again fallen under the yoke of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> (1291).

<p>(2) A new career was already open to their warlike and religious <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, in Eastern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, against the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. This coast of the Baltic, difficult of access, had hitherto resisted the efforts of the missionaries, many of whom had there laid down their lives. To avenge these <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> had been preached; a <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military order</a> founded with this object, the Sword-bearers (see <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">THE MILITARY ORDERS</a>), had not been very successful, when a Polish duke, Conrad of Massovia, determined to ask the assistance of the Teutonic Knights, offering them in return the territory of <a href="../cathen/04566a.htm">Culm</a> with whatever they could wrest from the infidels. <a href="../cathen/07267d.htm">Hermann of Salza</a>, fourth Grand Master of the order, was authorized to make this change by <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a>, who, moreover, raised him to the rank of prince of the empire (1230). The <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a> Hermann Balk, appointed Provincial of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, with twenty-eight of his brother <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> and a whole army of <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> began this struggle which lasted twenty-five years and was followed by colonization. Owing to the privileges assured to German colonists, new towns arose on all sides and eventually Germanized a country of which the natives belonged to the Letto-Slavic race. Thenceforth the history of this military principality is identified with that of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. In 1309 the fifteenth Grand Master, Sigfried of Feuchtwangen, transferred his residence from <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, where at that time the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> had their chief house, to the Castle of Marienburg, which they made a formidable fortress.

<p>The number of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> never exceeded a thousand, but the whole country was organized in a military manner, and with the constant arrival of new <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> the order was able to hold its own among its neighbours, especially the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a>, who were of the same race as the natives of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and, like them, <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>. In the battle of Rudau (1307) the Lithuanians were driven back, and they were converted only some years later, with their grand duke, Jagellon, who embraced <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> when he married the heiress of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> (1386). With this event, which put an end to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> in that section of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, the Teutonic Knights lost their <em>raison d'&#234;tre</em>. Thenceforth their history consists of incessant conflicts with the kings of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. Jagellon inflicted on them the defeat of Tannenberg (1410), which cost them 600 <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> and ruined their finances, in order to repair which the order was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to have recourse to exactions, which aroused the native nobility and the towns and provided the Poles with an opportunity to interfere against the order. A fresh <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> cost the order half its territory and the remaining half was only held under the suzerainty of the King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> (Treaty of Thorn, 1466). The loss of Marienburg caused the transfer of the Grand Master's residence to K&#246;nigsberg, which is still the capital of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> properly so-called. To maintain itself against the kings of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> the order had to rely on <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and to confide the office of Grand Master to German princes. But the second of these, <a href="../cathen/01262a.htm">Albert of Brandenburg</a> (1511), abused his position to secularize <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, at the same time embracing <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> (1525). He made <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> an hereditary fief of his house under the suzerainty of the Crown of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>.

<p>(3) Nevertheless, the dignitaries of the order in the remainder of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> faithfully preserved its possessions, and having broken with the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> chose a new Grand Master, Walter of Cronenberg, who fixed his residence at Mergentheim in Franconia (1526). After the loss of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> the order still retained in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> twelve bailiwicks, which they lost one by one. The secession of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a> (1580) meant the loss of the bailiwick of that name in the Low Countries. <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> secularized its possessions in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The Treaty of Lun&eacute;ville (1801) took away its possessions on the left bank of the Rhine and in 1809 <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> abandoned its possessions on the right bank to his allies of the Confederation of the Rhine. The Teutonics retained only the bailiwick in the Tyrol and that in the Austrian States.

<p>(4) Thus the order became purely Austrian, under the supreme authority of the Emperor of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, who reserves the dignity of Grand Master for an archduke of his house. Since 1894 it has been held by Archduke Eugene. There are at present 20 professed <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> who are bound to <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> while they enjoy a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> of the order, and 30 <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> who are not bound to this observance, but who must furnish an entrance fee of 1500 florins and an annual contribution of 100 florins. Moreover, their admission exacts a nobility of sixteen quarterings. The revenues of the order are now devoted to religious works; it has charge of 50 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 17 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and 9 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, for which object it supports 2 congregations of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 4 of sisters. Moreover, it performs ambulance service in time of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; it pays the cost of the ambulance, while lay Marians are engaged as ambulance bearers. Thus, after various vicissitudes the Teutonic Knights are restored to their original character of hospitallers. Besides this <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> branch in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> the order has a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> branch in the ancient bailiwick of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, the possessions of which have been preserved for the benefit of the nobility of the country. The members, who are chosen by the chapter of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, must give <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of four quarterings of nobility and profess the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> religion, but are dispensed from <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a>. When <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> took possession of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> in 1811 he suppressed the institution, but as early as 1815 the first King of the Low Countries, William I of Orange, re-established it, declaring himself its protector. The present order comprises 10 commanders, <em>Jonkheeren</em>, and aspirants (<em>expectanten</em>), who pay an entrance fee of 525 florins and have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to wear in their buttonhole a small cross of the order.
