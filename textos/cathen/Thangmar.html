<h1>Thangmar</h1>  

<p>(THANKMAR)

<p><a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">Historian</a>, b. about the middle of the tenth century; d. probably at <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a> after 1022. His first appearance in history is as the head of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>; at a later date he became dean of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and being at the same time notary and librarian his position was a very important one. Thangmar was distinguished both as a scholar and a statesman; he taught Bishops Bernward of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, <a href="../cathen/10148a.htm">Meinwerk of Paderborn</a>, and Benno of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a>, as well as the Emperor Henry II. He exercised great influence over Bernward of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, and a large part of the affairs under episcopal control were directed by him. In 1000 he accompanied Bernward to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was sent several times to the imperial court as the representative of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to settle important matters, being highly esteemed by Emperor <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a>. After the death of Bernward in 1022 he wrote an account of the active and varied life of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, a biography for which he had already gathered the material and of which he had probably written the first ten chapters during the years 1008-13. He had been an eye-witness of many of the events he relates and had taken as active part in all important measures. As he says himself, Bernward trusted him as a child does its father. Consequently his "Vita Bernwardi" is one of the finest biographical productions of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and is also one of the most valuable authorities for an important period of German history. He displays much affection for the dead <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and has written a plain and simple narrative, unrhetorical and truthful. It is only in the account of the dispute between the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a> and Maniz as to the right of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over Gandesheim that Thangmar appears at times to be a partisan of Bernward. The best edition is that in the "Mon. Germ. Hist.: Scriptores", IV, 757-782; it is also found in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., CXL, 393-436. The life has been edited in German by H&uuml;ffer (Berlin, 1857), and by Wattenbach (Leipzig, 1892).
