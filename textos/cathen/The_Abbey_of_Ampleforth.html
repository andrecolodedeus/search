<h1>The Abbey of Ampleforth</h1>  

<p>Ampleforth, located in the county of Yorkshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, belongs to the English Congregation of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> and has a lineal continuity with the pre-Reformation abbey of Westminster through Father Sebert Buckley, last surviving <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of that community. The present <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was founded in a house given to Father Anselm Bolton by Lady Anne Fairfax. This house was taken over by Dr. Brewer, President of the Congregation, 30 July, 1802. The community, since leaving Dieulouard in <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, where its members had joined with Spanish and Cassinese <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> to form the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>, had been successively at Acton Burnell, Tranmere, Scholes, Vernon Hall, and Parbold Hall, under its superior Dr. Marsh. On its migration to Ampleforth Lodge, Dr. Marsh remained at Parbold and Father Appleton was elected the first <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Shortly afterwards Parbold was broken up and the boys of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> there transferred to Ampleforth. The <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> was erected into an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, in 1890, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Diuquidem"; and has an important and flourishing college attached to it. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Newport, Dr. Hedley, is one of the most distinguished of its alumni, as well as its present superior, Abbot Smith. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was finished in 1897. "It is", says Almond "a tall, spacious building of four stories and a basement, joined to the old <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> by a <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. It is of grat <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> beauty. The whole of the basement is taken up by the monastic <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, consisting of some 30,00 columes, many of them of extreme rarity. The refectory, lecture halls, and the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot's</a> rooms are on the first floor; above are the cells of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, forty-eight in all. The pulic rooms are on the scale of the larger <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of pre-Reformation times". According to the English "Catholic Directory" for 1906, there are fifteen <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>; but there are a number of dependent missions served by <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the community. The titular abbacies of Westminster and York and the Cathedral <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>, and Rochester are attached to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>.
