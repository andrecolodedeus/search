<h1>The Abbey of Bonne-Esp&eacute;rance</h1>  

<p>Situated near Binche, province of Hainault, <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Diocese of Tournai</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. It owes its foundation to the conversion of William, the only son and heir of Rainard, the Knight of Croix. William had been seduced by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of Tanchelm, but through the persuasive exhortations of St. Norbert he had been brought back to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church, and his grateful <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, Rainard and <a href="../cathen/02375a.htm">Beatrix</a>, had given land to St. Norbert for the foundation of an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at Ramignies, while William followed St. Norbert to Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;. Ramignies having been found unsuitable, Odo, the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, led his young colony to another locality in the neighbourhood. The legend says that when Odo saw the spot he exclaimed: "Bon&aelig; spei fecisti filios tuos" (<a href="../bible/wis012.htm#vrs19">Wisdom 12:19</a> &mdash; O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Thou hast made Thy children to be of good hope). Others say that the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Our Lady of Good Hope was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> there. Whatever may have been the cause, Blessed Odo's confidence was not misplaced. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> grew and prospered and has ever sent forth numbers of holy and learned <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Blessed Odo was succeeded by Blessed Philip, surnamed the Almoner. Abbot Philip is the author of several books which have been published in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., CCIII. Blessed Oda, whose heroic act in defence of her virginity has been described by Abbot Philip, was a <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Rivreulle under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Bonne-Esp&eacute;rance. The forty-sixth and last <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Bonne-Esp&eacute;rance, Bonaventure Daublain, saw in 1792 and again in 1794 the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> taken and pillaged and his religious dispersed by the French Republican army. At the time of its suppression the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> counted sixty-seven inmates. Greatly though they wished to live in community, they were not allowed to do so during the French Republic nor after 1815 under William I, King of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. The last surviving religious gave the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a> for a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. The church is still <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> in its appearance, possessing as it does the body of St. Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric, which had been saved from the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and brought from the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> Abbey in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> to the Abbey of Bonne-Esp&eacute;rance in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. The church is still adorned with the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of St. Norbert, of St. Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric, and of two <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, St. Evremonde and St. Isfrid. At the time of the suppression the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Our Lady of Good Hope was hidden; and when peace was restored, it was brought to the church of Vellereille of which one of the canons of Bonne-Esp&eacute;rance was the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. In 1833 it was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> brought back to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church, or, as it is now, the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> church.
