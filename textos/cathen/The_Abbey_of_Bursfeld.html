<h1>The Abbey of Bursfeld</h1>  

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> on of the most celebrated <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> was the Abbey of Bursfeld, Situated directly west of G&ouml;ttingen, on the River Weser, in what is now the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Provence of <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>. It was founded in 1093 by Duke Henry of Nordheim and his wife Gertrude, who richly endowed it. Henry IV of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> granted it numerous privileges and <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a>. Its first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Almericus, came from the neighbouring Abbey of Corvey, bringing thence a band of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. Following the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> tradition, Almericus opened a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in connection with the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, which soon became famous, and under the next four <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> its fame continued to increase. But in 1331, under the worthless Abbot Henry Lasar, monastic discipline began to relax; the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was neglected, and the rich possessions were dissipated. From 1331 to 1424 no records of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> were kept. When, in 1424, the aged Albert of Bodenstein became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Bursfeld, church and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> had fallen almost into ruins, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> itself was in a dilapidated condition, and but one old <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> remained there. Albert would gladly have restored Bursfeld to its former splendour, but was too old to undertake the gigantic task. He resigned the abbacy in 1430.

<p>During the fifteenth century a strong desire for monastic and other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reforms made itself felt throughout the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world. One of the first <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> reformers was the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> John Dederoth, of M&uuml;nden of Nordheim. Having effected notable reforms at Clus, where he had been <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> since 1430, Dederoth was induced by Duke Otto of Brunswick, in 1433, to undertake the reform of Bursfeld. Obtaining four exemplary religious from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Matthias, he assigned two of them to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Clus, to maintain his reformed discipline there, while the other two went with him to Bursfeld. Being still <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Clus, he was able to recruit from that community for Bursfeld. Dederoth succeeded beyond expectations in the restoration of Bursfeld and began the reform of Reinhausen, near G&ouml;ttingen, but died 6 February, 1439, before his efforts in that quarter had borne fruit.
<h2>The Bursfeld Union</h2>

<p>Although the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> reformed by him never united into a congregation, still Dederoth's reforms may be looked upon as the foundation of the renowned Bursfeld Union, or Congregation. Dederoth, indeed, intended to unite the reformed <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Northern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> by a stricter uniformity of discipline, but the execution of his plan was left to his successor, the celebrated John of Hagen (not to be confounded with the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> John of Hagen, otherwise called Johannes de Indagine). In 1445 John of Hagen obtained permission from the Council of Basle to restore the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> to the original form of the old <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> and to introduce <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> and disciplinary uniformity in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> that followed the reform of Bursfeld. A year later (11 March, 1446) Louis d'Allemand, as <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Legate</a> authorized by the Council of Basle, approved the Bursfeld Union, which then consisted of the six <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>: Bursfeld, Clus, Reinhausen, Cismar in Schleswig-Holstein, St. Jacob near <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and Huysburg near Magdeburg. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> likewise decreed that the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Bursfeld should always ex officio be one of the three presidents of the congregation, and that he should have power to convoke annual chapters. The first annual chapter of the Bursfeld congregation convened in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Sts. Peter and Paul at Erfurt in 1446. In 1451, while on his journey of reform through <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Legate</a>, <a href="../cathen/11060b.htm">Nicholas of Cusa</a>, met John of Hagen at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>-Bamberg province held their triennial provincial chapter. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> appointed the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Bursfeld visitor for this province, and in a bull, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 7 June, 1451, the Bursfeld Congregation was approved, and favoured with new privileges. Finally, on 6 March, 1458, <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pope Pius II</a> approved the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the congregation and gave it all the privileges which <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> had given to the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Congregation of St. Justina since the year 1431. In 1461 this <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> was reiterated, and various new privileges granted to the congregation. Favoured by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, as well as by temporal rulers, especially the Dukes of Brunswick, the Bursfeld Congregation exercised a wholesome influence to promote <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reform in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> during the second half of the fifteenth, and the first half of the sixteenth, century. At the death of Abbot John of Hagen thirty-six <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> had already joined the Bursfeld Congregation, and new ones were being added every year. During its most flourishing period, shortly before the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> revolt, at least 136 <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, scattered through all parts of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, belonged to the Bursfeld Union.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">religious revolution</a>, and especially the consequent risings of the peasants in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, greatly retarded the progress of the Bursfeld Reform. In 1579, Andrew L&uuml;deritz, the last <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Bursfeld, was driven from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> by the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> Duke Julius of Brunswick, and, after an existence of almost five hundred years, Bursfeld ceased to be a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The possessions of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> were confiscated, and the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was replaced by an adherent of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. About forty other <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> belonging to the Bursfeld Congregation were wrested from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, their possessions confiscated by <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> princes, and their churches demolished or turned to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> uses. Though greatly impeded in its work of reform, the Bursfeld Congregation continued to exist until the compulsory secularization of all its <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at the end of the eighteenth, and the beginning of the nineteenth, century. Its last president was Bernard Bierbaum, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Werden inthe Rhine Province, who died in 1798. Bursfeld (Bursfelde) is at present a small village with about 200 inhabitants, for whom a <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> minister holds services in the old <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church.
