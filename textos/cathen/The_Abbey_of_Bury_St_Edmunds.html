<h1>The Abbey of Bury St. Edmund's</h1>  

<p>The first religious foundation there was established by Sigebert, King of the East Angles, who resigned his crown to found a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> about 537. It became celebrated when the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> King Edmund were brought there in 903, after which time the town, till then called Boedericsworth, became known as St. Edmund's Town or St. Edmund's Bury. During the reign of Canute (1016-35) the secular canons were replaced by <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>. In 1095 there was a solemn translation of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> to the new church built by Abbot Baldwin. The shrine grew in fame, wealth, and magnificence till the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was considered second only to Glastonbury, but in 1465 a terrible fire caused irreparable loss to the church, from which it never recovered. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> had a seat in Parliament and possessed full <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the town and neighbourhood. There was accomodation for eighty <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, but more than two hundred <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> resided in the Abbey. At the dissolution, the revenues were valued at &#163;2,366, equivalent to more than &#163;20,000 in present money. It was in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church that the memorable meeting of barons took place in the year 1214, when Cardinal Langton, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, standing at the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>, read out the proposed Charter of Liberties, which in the form of Magna Charta was signed by King John in 1215. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was finally <a href="../cathen/10455a.htm">dissolved by Henry VIII</a> in 1539, when the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church and the monastic buildings were in large measure destroyed, the gateway, an ancient bridge, and other scattered ruins alone now remaining. The fate of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> has never been decided. According to one tradition, they were abstracted by Prince Louis of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1217. <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">Relics</a> purporting to be those of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> were long preserved at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, until in 1901, <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, obtained leave to translate them to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">Doubts</a> having been thrown on the authenticity of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, a commission of investigation was appointed by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, but no report has been published. Among the famous <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the Abbey were Abbot Sampson and his chronicler <a href="../cathen/08418b.htm">Jocelin of Brakelond</a> (d. 1211); John Boston de Bury, author and bibliographer (d. 1430); John Lydgate, poet (d. 1446), and Byfield who was burnt for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in 1530.
