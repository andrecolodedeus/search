<div id="springfield2">
<h1>The Abomination of Desolation</h1>  

<p>The importance of this <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptural</a> expression is chiefly derived from the fact that in <a href="../bible/mat024.htm#vrs15">Matthew 24:15</a>, and <a href="../bible/mar013.htm#vrs14">Mark 13:14</a>, the appearance of the "abomination of desolation" standing in the "Holy Place" (Matthew), or where "it ought not" (Mark), is given by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> as the signal for their flight from <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, at the time of the approaching ruin of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../bible/luk021.htm#vrs20">Luke 21:20</a>). The expression itself is confessedly obscure. To determine its meaning, interpreters have naturally betaken themselves to the original Hebrew of the <a href="../bible/dan000.htm">book of Daniel</a>; for our first <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> distinctly says that "the abomination of desolation" he has in view "was spoken of by <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel the prophet</a>"; and further, the expression he makes use of, in common with <a href="../cathen/09674a.htm">St. Mark</a>, is simply the Greek phrase whereby the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> translators rendered literally the Hebrew words <em>sh&iacute;qq&ucirc;&ccedil; sh&ocirc;mem</em> found in <a href="../bible/dan012.htm#vrs11">Daniel 12:11</a>; <a href="../bible/dan009.htm#vrs27">9:27</a>; <a href="../bible/dan011.htm#vrs31">11:31</a>. Unfortunately, despite all their efforts to explain these Hebrew terms, <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">Biblical</a> scholars are still at variance about their precise meaning. While most <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commentators</a> regard the first <em>"sh&iacute;qq&ucirc;&ccedil;"</em>, usually rendered by "abomination", as designating anything (statue, altar, etc.) that pertains to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> worship, others take it to be a contemptuous designation of a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> god or idol. Again, while most commentators render the second <em>"sh&ocirc;mem"</em> by the abstract word "desolation", others treat it as a concrete form referring to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, "a ravager", or even as a participial known meaning "that maketh desolate". The most recent interpretation which has been suggested of these Hebrew words is to the following effect: The phrase <em>sh&iacute;qq&ucirc;&ccedil; sh&ocirc;mem</em> stands for the original expression <em>b&aacute;' &aacute;l sh&aacute;m&aacute;y&icirc;m</em> (Baal of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>), a title found in <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenician</a> and Aramaic <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">inscriptions</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">semitic</a> equivalent of the Greek <em>Zeus</em>, Jupiter, but modified in Daniel through <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> aversion for the name of a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deity</a>. While thus disagreeing as to the precise sense of the Hebrew phrase usually rendered by "the abomination of desolation", <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> scholars are practically at one with regard to its general meaning. They commonly admit, and indeed rightly, that the Hebrew expression must needs be understood of some <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> emblem, the setting up of which would entail the ultimate desolation of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple of Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../bible/1ma001.htm#vrs57">1 Maccabees 1:57</a>; <a href="../bible/1ma004.htm#vrs38">iv, 38</a>). And with this general meaning in view, they proceed to determine the historical event between <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> prediction and the ruin of the Temple (A.D. 70), which should be regarded as "the abomination of desolation" spoken of in <a href="../bible/mat024.htm#vrs15">Matthew 24:15</a>, and <a href="../bible/mar013.htm#vrs14">Mark 13:14</a>. But here they are again divided. Many scholars have thought, and still think, that the introduction of the Roman standards into the Holy Land, and more particularly into the <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Holy City</a>, shortly before the destruction of the Temple, is the event foretold by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> to His disciples as the signal for their flight from <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the standards were <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">worshipped</a> by the Roman soldiers and abhorred by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as the emblem of Roman <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Yet they can hardly be considered as the "the abomination of desolation" referred to in <a href="../bible/mat024.htm#vrs15">Matthew 24:15</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> says that this "abomination" is to stand in the "holy place", whereby is naturally meant the Temple (see also <a href="../bible/dan009.htm#vrs27">Daniel 9:27</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> reads: "there shall be in the Temple the abomination of the desolation"), and the Roman standards were actually introduced into the Temple only after it had been entered by Titus, that, too late to serve as a warning for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>. Other scholars are of the mind that the <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecration</a> of the Temple by the Zealots who seized it and made it their stronghold shortly before <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was invested by Titus, is the event foretold by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>. But this view is commonly rejected for the simple reason that "the abomination of desolation" spoken of by Daniel and referred to in <a href="../bible/mat024.htm#vrs15">St. Matthew's Gospel</a>, was certainly something connected with <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> worship. Others, finally, interpret <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> warning to His disciples in the light of the history of attempt to have his own <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> set up and worshipped in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple of Jerusalem</a>. The following are the principal facts of that history. About A.D. 40, Caius Caligula issued a peremptory <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> ordering the erection and worship of his statute in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple of God</a>. He also appointed to the government of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, bidding him carry out that <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> even at the cost of a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the rebellious <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Whereupon the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in tens of thousands protested to the governor that they were willing to be slaughtered rather than to be condemned to witness that <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">profanation</a> of their holy Temple. Soon afterwards Petronius asked Caligula to <a href="../cathen/13007a.htm">revoke</a> his order, and <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#IV">Agrippa I</a>, who then lived at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, prevailed upon the Emperor not to enforce his <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>. It seems, however, that Caligula soon repented of the concession, and that but for his untimely death (A.D. 41) he would have had his <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> set up in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (E. Schurer, <em>History of the Jewish People in the Time of Christ</em>, I Div. II, 95-105; tr.). In view of these facts it is affirmed by many scholars that the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> could easily regard the forthcoming erection of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> in the Temple as the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> abomination which, according to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../bible/dan009.htm#vrs27">Daniel 9:27</a>, portended the ruin of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">House of God</a>, and therefore see in it the actual sign given by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> for their flight from <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>. This last interpretation of the phrase "the abomination of desolation" is not without its own difficulties. Yet it seems preferable to the others that have been set for by commentators at large.
