<h1>The Alexandrine Liturgy</h1>  

<p>The tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> traces its origin to the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> St. Mark, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, and ascribes to him the parent liturgy from which all the others used by <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a>, <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a>, and by the daughter-Church of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> are derived. These three bodies possess the three groups of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> used throughout the original Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. There is the Greek Liturgy of St. Mark, the oldest form of the three, used for some centuries after the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a>; there are then three <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, still used by the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a>, translated into Coptic from the Greek and derived from the Greek St. Mark, and, further, a number of <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> (Ethiopic) uses, of which the foundation is the "Liturgy of the Twelve Apostles", that also descends from the original Greek Alexandrine rite By comparing these <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> and noticing what is common to them, it is possible in some measure to reconstruct the old use of the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Church of Alexandria</a> as it existed before the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451). There are, moreover, other indications of that use. <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (d. c. 217) makes one or two allusions to it, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> (d. 373) has many more; the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> Book of Serapion, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14658a.htm">Thmuis</a> in the middle of the fourth century, and the descriptions of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius</a> (De hierarch&acirc; eccl.), at about the same time, in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, make it possible to reconstruct the outline of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Liturgy of their time, which is then seen to coincide with the Liturgy of St. Mark.
<h2 id="section1">The Liturgy of St. Athanasius, Serapion, and Pseudo-Dionysius</h2>

<p>The Mass was divided into two chief parts, the Mass of the Catechumens and that of the Faithful. When the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> persuaded a certain Ischyras to accuse St. Athanasius of having overturned his altar and broken his <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> during the Liturgy, they made the mistake of producing a <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a> as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. St. Athanasius could at once point out that the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> is not brought to the altar till the Mass of the Faithful, when the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> have been dismissed (Contr. Arian., xxviii and xlvi). The Mass of the Catechumens consisted of Lessons from <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, Psalms sung alternately, and Homilies. Then follow the blessing and dismissal of various kinds of people who are not allowed to be present at the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, penitents, and energumens. In Serapion and <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius</a> the Mass of the Faithful begins with the bringing of the oblations to the altar; they are then covered with a veil. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> reads out a <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> for various causes (<em>he katholike</em>), to each petition of which the people answer "Kyrie eleison", and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> sums up their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in a collect. Then follows the <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a>. St. Athanasius appears to place the offering of the gifts at this point (Protest, Lit. des IV. Jahrh., iii). The <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> are read, followed by another collect and a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the people. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> washes his hands and begins the <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">Eucharistic Prayer</a> (of which our Preface is the first part). The opening of the <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">Eucharistic Prayer</a> has always been very long in the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Liturgy. St. Athanasius refers to thanksgiving for the Creation, with detailed references to the different works, the <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Garden of Eden</a>, the Incarnation, and so on; then comes an allusion to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angels</a> and their orders, who praise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and say (and the people interrupt the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> by taking up the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angels'</a> words): "Holy, holy, holy, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of hosts". The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> continues, praises <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">God the Son</a> who, having been made Man, on the night when He was betrayed took bread, blessed, broke, and gave it to His disciples, saying . . . The words of Institution follow, although St. Athanasius, because of the <em><a href="../cathen/05032a.htm">disciplina arcani</a></em>, avoids quoting them. Nor does he mention the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> that certainly followed. Theophilus of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> (385-412) says that: "The Bread of the Lord, in which the Body of the Saviour is shown, which we break for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and the holy Chalice which is placed upon the Table of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are (at first) unquickened, but are sanctified by the Invocation and descent of the Holy Ghost" (translated by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, Ep. xcviii, n. 13). The <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is shown to the people, the Host is broken (the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Our Father</a> was probably said at this point), Communion is given, the Host by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the Chalice by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and the Thanksgiving (apparently <a href="../bible/psa033.htm">Psalm 33</a>) is said. We notice already in these first references the great length of the first part of the <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">Eucharistic Prayer</a> (the Preface), and the fact that the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> are read before the Consecration. These two notes are characteristic of all the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> uses.


<h2 id="section2">The Greek Liturgy of St. Mark</h2>

<p>This rite as it now exists has already undergone considerable development. A Prothesis (perparation of the oblations before the beginning of the actual liturgy) has been added to it from the Byzantine Liturgy; the Creed is said as at Constantinople just before the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a>; the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> shows signs of the same influence; and the Great entrance is accompanied by a Cherubikon. Since the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> this use was more and more affected by the Byzantine Liturgy, till at last it entirely gave way to it among the <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a>. However, it is possible to disengage it from later additions and to reproduce the original Greek Alexandrine Liturgy, the parent rite of all others in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. After the Prothesis, the Mass of the Catechumens begins with the greeting of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>: "Peace to all", to which the people answer: "And with thy spirit." The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> says "Pray" and they repeat <em>Kyrie eleison</em> three times; the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> then says a collect. The whole rite is repeated three times, so that there are nine Kyrie eleisons interspersed with greeting and collects. During the Little Entrance (processions of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> with the books for the lessons) the choir sings the Trisagion (Holy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Holy Strong One, Holy Mortal One, have mercy on us). The lessons begin with the usual greeting: "Peace to all". Response: "And with thy spirit". "The Apostle" is read, and then, after <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> has been put into the thurible, follows the Gospel. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> tells the people to stand while they hear it. <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> (d. after 425) notes as a peculiar custom of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> does not stand at the Gospel (Hiss. Eccl., VII, xix). After the Gospel follows the Homily. Both <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> and <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> say that in their time only the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> preaches, and they ascribe this custom to the result of the trouble caused by Arius (Socr., V, xxii; Soz., VII, xix). Before the Catechumens are dismissed a <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> (the great <em>Ekteneia</em>) is said by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. He tells the people to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the living, the sick, travellers, for fine weather, and the fruits of the earth, for the "regular rise of the waters of the river" (the Nile, an important matter in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>), "good rain and the cornfields of the earth" for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all men, "the safety of the world and of this city", for "our Christ-loving sovereigns". for <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>, "those fallen asleep", "the sacrifice of our offerings", for the afflicted, and for the Catechumens. To each clause the people answer: "Kyrie eleison." The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> meanwhile is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> silently for the same objects, and when the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> is finished, he ends his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> aloud with the <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm">doxology</a>. The "verse" (<em>stichos</em>, a verse from a psalm) is sung, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> says "The Three", that is, three <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the Patriarch, and the local Church; in each case the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> ends with a collect. The <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> are then dismissed, and the Mass of the Faithful begins with the "Great Entrance". The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> bring the offerings from the Prothesis to the altar while the people sing the Cherubikon. The <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a> follows, with the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> belonging to it; then the Creed is said and the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> at the altar. (In other <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> is said before the Great Entrance at the Prothesis.) The <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> begins, as always, with the greeting to the people and the dialogue: "Let us lift up our hearts." Response: "We have them to the Lord." &#151; "Let us give thanks to the Lord." Response: "It is meet and just." And then the <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">Eucharistic Prayer</a>: "It is truly meet and just, right, holy, proper, and good for our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, O Master, Lord, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Almighty Father, to praise Thee. . . . . ." The peculiarity of all the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Liturgies is that the Supplication for various causes and people, which in all other rites follows the Sanctus and the Consecration, comes at this point, during what we should call the Preface. The Alexandrine Preface then is very long; interwoven into it are a series of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the Emperor, the sick, fruits of the earth, and so on. Again the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to "draw up the waters of the river to their right measure"; he remembers various classes of Saints, especially St. Mark, says the first part of the Hail Mary, and then goes on aloud; "especially our all-holy, immaculate, and glorious <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Lady Mary</a>, Mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and ever Virgin." The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> here reads the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> of the death; the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> continues his supplication for the patriarch, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and all the living; the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> calls out to the people to stand and then to look towards the east; and so at last comes the Sanctus: "the many-eyed <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">Cherubim</a> and the six-winged <a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a>. . . sing, cry out, praise Thee, and say: Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts". And then aloud he goes on: "Sanctify all of us and receive our praise, who with all who sanctify Three, Lord and Master, sing and say" (and the people continue): "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord." After the long Preface the Canon up to the words of Institution is very short. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, as usual, takes up the people's words and almost at once comes to "Our Lord, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and great King (<em>pambasileus</em>), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who in the night in which he gave himself to a most dreadful death for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, taking the bread in His holy, pure, and immaculate hands, and looking up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> to Thee, His Father, our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all things, gave thanks, blessed, broke, and gave it to His holy and blessed Disciples and Apostles, saying [aloud]: Take, eat [the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> tells the concelebrating <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to stretch out their hands], for this is My Body, broken and given for you for the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Response: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. The words of Institution of the Chalice are said in the same way. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> lifts up his voice at the end, saying: "Drink of this all"; the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> says: "Again stretch out your hands", and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> continues: "this is My Blood of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, shed for you and for many and given for the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Response: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. "Do this in memory of Me, . . ." And the Anamnesis follows, referring to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">death</a>, <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascension</a>, and second coming and going immediately on to the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a>: "Send down upon us and upon this bread and <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> Thy Holy Ghost that He as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> may <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> and perfect them [aloud] and make this bread the Body." Response: "Amen." And this <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> the Blood of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, the Blood of our Lord, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Saviour, and great King, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>." . . . The <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> ends with a <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm">doxology</a> to which the people answer: "As it was and is". Then follow the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Our Father</a>, said first by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> silently and then aloud lay the people, with the usual Embolismos, the Inclination before the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> &#151; the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> says: "Let us bow our heads before the Lord", and the people answer: "Before Thee O Lord"; the <a href="../cathen/05380b.htm">Elevation</a> with the words: "Holy things to the Holy"; and the answer: "One Holy Father, one Holy Son, one Holy Ghost, in the union of the Holy Ghost. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>". Then come the Breaking of the Bread, during which Psalm cl (<em>Laudate Dominum in sanctis eius</em>) is sung, and the Communion. The form of Communion is: "The holy Body" and then "the precious Blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord, God and Saviour</a>". A short thanksgiving follows, and the people are dismissed with the blessing quoted from <a href="../bible/2co013.htm#vrs13">2 Corinthians 13:13</a>. Some more <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are said in the Diakonikon, and the liturgy ends with the words: "Blessed be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesses</a>, sanctifies, protects, and keeps us all through the share in His holy mysteries. He is blessed for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>."

<p>The characteristic points of this rite are the nine Kyrie eleisons at the beginning, the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> said at the altar instead of at the Prothesis, and especially the place of the great Supplication before the Sanctus. This last circumstance causes the Consecration to occur much later in this Liturgy than in any of the others. It should be noted that the place of the Supplication is a difficulty in the Roman Mass. We say part of it (for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, Pope, and Bishop, the <em>Memento Vivorum</em> and <em>Communicantes</em>) before and part (<em>Memento Defunctorum, Mobis quoque peccatoribus</em>) after the Consecration. In the Antiochene use, and in all those derived from it, the whole Supplication comes after the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a>. It has been suggested that the explanation of these differences is that originally everywhere the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> began to read out the clauses of the Supplication as soon as the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> had begun the <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">Eucharistic Prayer</a>. They would then go on saying their parts together, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> being interrupted by the words said aloud by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. The point at which the Supplication ends would then depend on its length; and if eventually that point (at which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> sums up its clauses in a collect) were taken as its place in the liturgy, it might occur before the Consecration (as at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>), or after it (as at Antioch), or the Supplication might still be said partly before and partly after (as at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>). The Roman use, then, would repress sent an intermediate stage of development (cf. A. Gastou&eacute; in Cabrol, Diet. d'arch. chr&eacute;t. et de liturgie, Paris, 1904). But the parallels between the Roman and Alexandrine uses are too obvious not to suggest a common source for these Liturgies. There is the <a href="../cathen/08714a.htm">Kyrie eleison</a>, said nine times in groups of three, as soon as the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> stands at the altar, just before the Trisagion which more or less corresponds to our <em>Gloria in excelsis</em>. There are, moreover, clauses and even whole <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> whose common origin with those of our Canon cannot be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>. As an example, let the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> said after the reading of the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> of the dead be compared with our <em>Supra quae</em> and <em>Supplices te rogamus</em>. In St. Mark's liturgy it is: "Receive, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Sacrifice, offerings, and Eucharist of thy servants on Thy holy, heavenly, and spiritual altar in the height of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> by the ministry of thy archangels . . . as Thou didst receive the gifts of Thy just Abel and the sacrifice of our father Abraham. . ." There are other parallel passages no less striking; so that, in spite of likenesses between the <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">Roman Canon</a> and the Syrian <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a>, it is with this <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Liturgy that ours is generally supposed to have had a common source (Duchesne, Origines, p. 54). <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> and <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> notice some peculiarities of the Alexandrine Patriarchate in the fifth century. On Wednesdays and Fridays the Liturgy was not celebrated (Socr., V, xxii, who says this is a most ancient custom). In this case, too, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> follow the same practice, whereas that of all the other <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a> is different (Duchesne, Origines, p. 220). The first two sees also agreed in having no Mass on Saturday; in other parts of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> there was a Liturgy of the Presanctified, and people received <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> on Saturday evening, not <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> (Socr., ib., Soz., VII, xix, <em>mysterion metechousi</em>).
<h2 id="section3">The Coptic liturgies</h2>

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> composed a number of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> in their own language. Three of these became the most inportant and are still used: those of St. Cyril, <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory (of Nazianzus)</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>. They differ only in the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphoras</a> which are joined to a common Preparation and Mass of the Catechumens. The <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> of St. Cyril, also called that of St. Mark, together with the part of the liturgy that is common to all, corresponds exactly to the Greek St. Mark. When it was translated into Coptic a great part of the formulas, such as the Trisagion, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a>, said at the beginning of the Mass of the Faithful, nearly all the short greetings like <em>eirene pasin ano hymon tas kardias ta hagia tois hagiois</em>, and everything said by the people had already become universally known in Greek. These parts were then left in that language, and they are still written or printed in Greek, although in Coptic characters, throughout the Coptic Liturgy. A few <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> have been added to the original Greek Liturgy, such as a very definite act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a> said by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> before his Communion. There are also Greek versions of the other two <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphoras</a>: those of St. Basil and <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory</a>.
<h2 id="section5">The present use</h2>

<p>Of these three groups two, the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> and <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinians</a>, still keep their own <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> use that of St. Basil throughout out the year on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and weekdays, and for requiems; on certain great feasts they substitute the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> of <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory</a>; that of St. Cyril is kept for <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> and <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas eve</a>. This order is common to the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> and Uniate <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a>. Very soon after the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> conquered <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (641) their language became they only one used ever by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; in less than two centuries Coptic had become a completely dead language. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> have for a long tine been written in Arabic as well; sometimes Arabic translations of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are added too. The books needed for the Liturgy are the <em>Khulaji</em> (<em>euchologion</em>), <em>Kutmarus</em> (<em>kata meros</em>), a lectionary containing the lessons from <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, the <em>Synaxar</em> (<em>synaxarion</em>), which contains legends of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, sometimes read instead of those from the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>, and the "Book of the Ministry of the Deacons" (Brightman, lxvii). The Coptic and <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> Uniates have books specially printed for them, which differ from the others only inasmuch as the names of <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> are omitted, that of Chalcedon is inserted, and the Filioque is added to the Creed. The <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> has long sacrificed her own use for that of Constantinople. For a time after the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> she still kept the Liturgy of St. Mark in Greek. But there were very few Orthodox left in the country; they revere nearly all officials of the Imperial government, and, after the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> conquest especially, the influence of Constantinople over them, as over the whole Orthodox world, grew enormously. So eventually they followed the Ecumenical Patriarch in their rites as in everything else. The Orthodox <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a> even went to live at Constantinople under the shadow of Caesar and of Caesar's Court Bishop. The change of liturgy took place at the end of the twelfth century. <a href="../cathen/02226b.htm">Theodore Balsamon</a> says that at that tine a certain Mark, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>, came to Constantinople and there went on celebrating the Liturgy of his own Church. The <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> told him that the use of the most holy Ecumenical throne was different, and that the Emperor had already commanded all <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> throughout the world to follow that of the Imperial city. So Mark apologized for not having known about this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and conformed to the Byzantine use (P.G., CXXXVIII, 954). Since then the Greek Liturgy of St. Mark has no longer been used by anyone. It remains to be seen whether, now that the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> has begun to make some small restoration of her own use (see <a href="../cathen/01571a.htm">ANTIOCHENE LITURGY</a>), the very determined and strongly anti-Phanariote <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> who rules the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (Lord Photios of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>) will not revive, at any rate for one day in the year, the venerable liturgy of his own see.

In her liturgies, as in everything else, the Church of Abyssinia depends on the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. The normal and original Ethiopic use is the "Liturgy of the Twelve Apostles", which is the Coptic St. Cyril done into their own language. The Abyssinians have also a number of other Anaphoras (ten or fifteen) ascribed to various people such as St. John the Evangelist, the 318 Fathers of Nic&aelig;a, St. John Chrysostom, etc., which they join to the first part of their Liturgy on various occasions instead of its own Canon. <br>THE ETHIOPIC LITURGIES. MANUSCRIPTS. &#151; The Vatican library contains manuscripts of Anaphoras (Vat. Ethiop., XIII, XVI, XXII, XXVIII, XXIX, XXXIV, XXXIX, LXVI LXIX) the British Museum has a seventeenth-century manuscript of the Ordo Communis with various Anaphoras (Or. 545) and there are others and fragments at Paris and Berlin, all as late as the seventeenth century. <br>PRINTED TEXTS. SWAINSON, op cit., 349-395; although this is described as the Coptic Ordinary Canon of the Mass, it is the Ethiopic Pre-anaphoral according to the Brit. Mug.
