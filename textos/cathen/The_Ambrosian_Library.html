<h1>The Ambrosian Library</h1>  

<p>The Ambrosian Library is one of the famous <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of the world, founded between 1603 and 1609 by <a href="../cathen/02688b.htm">Cardinal Federigo Borromeo</a> at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. This <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> is unique from the fact that it was not intended by the <a href="../cathen/02688b.htm">Cardinal</a> to be merely a collection of books and masterpieces of art, but was meant by him to include a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of writers, a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of savants, and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a>. It is situated in what at that time was nearly the centre of the city of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, near the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Holy Sepulchre. The plans were drawn by the architect, Fabio Mangone, and the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>, Dionigio Bussola. The buildings were ready in 1609, and became at once, on account of their ample dimensions and elegant decoration, an object of universal admiration. The following description, although of the present-day building, is an accurate one of the original, as no alterations have ever been permitted; even the floor of plain tiles, with four tables (one in each corner) and a central brazier, is left as the <a href="../cathen/02688b.htm">Cardinal</a> arranged it.

<p>A plain Ionic portico, on the <a href="../cathen/04379b.htm">cornice</a> of which are the words <em>BIBLIOTHECA AMBROSIANA</em>, gives access to a single hall, on the ground floor, seventy-four feet long by twenty-nine feet broad. The walls are lined with bookcases about thirteen feet high, separated, not by columns, but by flat pilasters, and protected by wire work of an unusually large mesh, said to be original. At each corner of the hall is a staircase, leading to a gallery, two feet and six inches wide. The cases in this gallery are about eight feet and six inches high. Above them again is a frieze consisting of a series of portraits of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in oblong frames. The roof is a barrel-vault, ornamented with plaster-work. Light is admitted through two enormous semicircular windows at each end of the room. A splendid view of the interior, together with a ground-plan, may be seen in Clark's "The Care of Books" (p. 271). The arrangement of books was considered remarkable at that time, for a contemporary writer says of it, "the room is not blocked with desks to which the books are tied with iron chains after the fashion of the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> which are common in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, but it is surrounded with lofty shelves on which the books are sorted according to size" [Gli Instituti Scientifici etc. di Milano (Milan, 1880) p. 123, note].

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was open not merely to members of the college, which was part of the endowment, but also to citizens of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and to all strangers who came to study there; the severest penalties awaited those who stole a volume, or even touched it with soiled hands, and only the Pope himself could absolve them from such crimes (Boscha, "De origine et statu bibl. Ambros.", 19; ap. Gr&aelig;vius, "Thes. ant. et hist. Itali&aelig;", IX, Part VI; see also the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 7 July, 1608, approving the foundation and rehearsing the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, in "Magnum Bullarium Romanum", Turin, 1867, XI, 511). The story of the gathering of the equipment of this splendid <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> is most interestingly set forth by the writers cited. A digest will be found in the "Catholic University Bulletin", I, 567.

<p><a href="../cathen/02688b.htm">Cardinal Borromeo</a> first applied to his friends, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, princes, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and religious, who responded generously. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> sent a great number of ancient <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> gave a codex on <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> papyrus, containing the "Jewish Antiquities" of <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>. Count Galeazzo Arconati offered the autograph works of <a href="../cathen/15440a.htm">Leonardo da Vinci</a>, which King James I of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> could not purchase for 3,000 golden crowns. The <a href="../cathen/02688b.htm">Cardinal</a> sent agents abroad throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and the East. In 1607 his secretary, Grazio Maria Grazi, was exploring the cities of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; a most notable purchase being that of the Pinelli Library bought at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> for 3,400 pieces of gold and filling seventy cases. Other agents gathered treasures in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, bringing back an ample store of books and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. They were again dispatched by the <a href="../cathen/02688b.htm">Cardinal</a> to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, while another agent was sent to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> where he was fortunate in making splendid purchases. Three different agents were sent by <a href="../cathen/02688b.htm">Cardinal Borromeo</a> to the East, one of them a converted rabbi. By means of these agents the treasures of the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> were vastly increased, Chaldean books, Bibles, treatises of <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a> and mathematics, <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a>, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a>, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> being acquired; these were collected by a great expenditure of money, one of the agents having spent in the service of the <a href="../cathen/02688b.htm">Cardinal</a> more money than any monarch had ever given for such an enterprise. This particular agent underwent many grave dangers in his quest, and finally died of the pest in Aleppo.

<p>Though the Ambrosian Library could not rival the Vatican, nor the Laurentiana at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, nor the Marciana at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, it enjoyed a greater popularity than those ever possessed, because it was thrown open to all students without distinction, a rare and unheard of thing at that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. It was practically the first <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> to offer facilities for reading or notetaking. The <a href="../cathen/02688b.htm">Cardinal's</a> liberality earned the applause of the learned men of his day, and his example was soon followed in the Bodleian at <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">Oxford</a>, the Angelica at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and later on in the Mazarine and the Biblioth&egrave;que Royale at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. In 1865 a monument was erected to <a href="../cathen/02688b.htm">Cardinal Federigo Borromeo</a>, who died 30 Sept., 1631. The monument stands before the gates of the Ambrosian Library as a lasting evidence of the city's gratitude to this great patron of arts and letters. It bears the following simple but heartfelt inscription: "<em>AL CARDINAL FEDERICO BORROMEO I SUOI CONCITTADINI MDCCCLXV</em>". On one side of the pedestal is the phrase from <a href="../cathen/09634a.htm">Manzoni's</a> "I Promessi Sposi": "He was one of those men rare in every age, who employed extraordinary intelligence, the resources of an opulent condition, the advantages of privileged stations, and an unflinching will in the search and practice of higher and better things". On the other side are the words: "He conceived the plan of the Ambrosian Library, which he built at great expense, and organized in 1609 with an equal activity and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>".
