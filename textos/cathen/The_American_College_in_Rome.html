<h1>The American College in Rome</h1>  

<p>The American College in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, or to give the legal title, "The American College of the Roman Catholic Church of the United States, Rome, Italy", owes its existence chiefly to Archbishop Hughes, of New York, and <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, who were the most conspicuous supporters of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in founding at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> this institution which has done so much for half-a-century to preserve and propagate Roman traditions and maintain unity between the See of Peter and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. When a number of American <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1854 to be present at the proclamation of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, they expressed to <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> the desire to see an American college established that should take rank with the other national colleges in that city. Bishop Michael O'Connor, of <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, an alumnus of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> seconded the efforts of the leading <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> already mentioned, and specially pressed the matter on the attention of the Pontiff. In his reply to the letter of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> composing the First <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of New York, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> proposed the establishment of a North American College in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Archbishop Hughes, who had long fostered this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, immediately wrote to the other <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and to his suffragans, extolling the Pope's design and asking their advice as to the best method of putting it into execution, and of procuring the means <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to support the college when established. In the Eighth <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> held from May 6 to May 16, 1855, it was resolved to appoint a committee of three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to report on the subject of the American College. Bishop O'Connor, of <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, Bishop Neumann, of Philadelphia and Dr. Lynch, Administrator of <a href="../cathen/03630a.htm">Charleston</a>, were appointed. It was subsequently agreed that the Pope should be asked to select three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as a committee to carry out the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>; that the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> should act as promoter until their appointment, and that an active and experienced <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> should be sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to make the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> preparations. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> became so interested in the project that he offered to purchase and present a suitable building for the purpose, while the American <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> would furnish it and procure the funds <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for its maintenance. In 1857, the Pope bought for $42,000, the old Visitation Convent of the Umilt&#224;, then occupied by soldiers of the French garrison in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The free use of it in perpetuity was accorded to the American <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. By reason of its military occupation the building was in bad condition. On 12 December, 1858 the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of New York ordered a general collection in all the churches of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> to procure funds for the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> repairs and for the furnishing of the college. The people were most generous in their contributions, and the other American <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> co-operated so liberally that in a short time the sum of nearly $50,000 was collected. Repairs were immediately begun on the building, and in the year following it was fit for occupancy. On the 8th of December, 1859, the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was formally opened with thirteen students who had for some time been waiting in the College of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> for this event. On the day of the opening of the college, <a href="../cathen/02387a.htm">Monsignor Bedini</a>, Secretary of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Sacred Congregation of the Propaganda</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the marble altar of the college <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and on the twelfth of the same month the feast of Our Lady of Guadaloupe, to whom one of the side altars is dedicated, he celebrated Pontifical Mass in the college church. On the feast of <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a>, 29 January, 1860, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> visited the college. To commemorate this event, a tablet bearing the following inscription was put up: "On January 29, 1860, the feast of St. Francis de Sales, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Supreme Pontiff</a>, father and founder of the American College, said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in this building, fed the alumni with the heavenly banquet, visited the college, and deigned to give audience to all". His Holiness was assisted on the occasion by <a href="../cathen/02191a.htm">Bishop David Bacon</a>, of <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Portland</a>, <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/06663a.htm">Monsignor Goss</a>, of <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>.

<p>The Rev. Bernard Smith, O.S.B., professor in the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> College, and afterwards an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, was appointed temporary <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the college, until the appointment, in March, 1860, of the Rev. William George McCloskey, who was then an assistant at the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Nativity, <a href="../cathen/11020a.htm">New York City</a>, and later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>. During the administration of Father McCloskey the college flourished, the number of students increasing rapidly from thirteen to fifty of whom six came from New York, four from <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Newark</a> two from <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a> five from Philadelphia, and the remainder from the New England States, the South and the West. The first <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of an alumnus to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> was on the 14th of June, 1862, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> St. John Lateran, by Cardinal Patrizzi. The finances of the college were not, however on a sound basis; the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, therefore, in 1866, appealed for aid to the American <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled in the second <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>. The appeal was successful, for Archbishop Spalding, who as Delegate of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, convoked and presided at the Council, in his letter <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgating</a> its decrees, commended the college to the good will of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. In consequence, the Rev. George H. Doane, a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Diocese of Newark</a>, was appointed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to collect funds for the college. After making a tour of the country, he succeeded in collecting $150,000, which at once placed the college on an excellent financial footing.



<p>During the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, the American <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> decided that the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the college should remain in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Sacred Congregation of Propaganda</a>. With regard to the burses or scholarships founded, it was agreed that when they were vacant, one-half of the proceeds should go to the college and the other half to the diocese to which the <a href="../cathen/03084b.htm">burse</a> belonged. There are now (1906) thirty-five burses founded in the college. The Rev. Dr. McCloskey was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, in 1868, and was succeeded by the Rev. Dr. Francis Silas Chatard, who remained <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> until 12 May 1878, when he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vincennes <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>. The Rev. Dr. Louis Hostlot, vice-rector of the college, succeeded Dr. Chatard and remained in office till his death, 1 February, 1884. Then for a time the Rev. Dr. Augustin J. Schulte governed the college, until the election of the Rev. Dennis J. O'Connell, D.D., now Rector of the Catholic University at Washington. He resigned in July, 1895, and was succeeded by the Rev. William H. O'Connell, D.D., who became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Portland</a>, <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a>, in 1901. The Right Rev. Monsignor Thomas F. Kennedy, of Philadelphia, succeeded him. Under Dr. Kennedy's rectorship <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> adjoining the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was purchased, in November, 1903, at a cost of $50,000. His predecessor, Dr. William H. O'Connell, had purchased for $20,000 the Villa Santa Catarina, at Castel Gandolfo, as a summer residence for the students. At the present time (May, 1906) their number is one hundred and fifteen, the largest number the college has ever had. The college has an Alumni Association in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> comprising two hundred and seventy-five members, out of four hundred and fifty students who have been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the college. This association made a contribution of $25,000 to the fund for the recent acquisition of new <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> by the college. Besides the late <a href="../cathen/04395a.htm">Archbishop Corrigan</a>, of New York, the following American <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, who are still living, Studied <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> in the college: <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> Farley, of New York, Moeller, of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>; O'Connell, of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>; Bishops Richter, of <a href="../cathen/06726a.htm">Grand Rapids</a>; Burke, of St. Joseph, Mo.; Horstmann, of <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>; McDonnell, of <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, Hoban of <a href="../cathen/13633a.htm">Scranton</a>, Rooker, of <a href="../cathen/08323d.htm">Jaro</a>, P.I.; Dougherty, of <a href="../cathen/11149b.htm">Nueva Segovia</a>, P.I.; Morris, Coadjutor, of <a href="../cathen/09295a.htm">Little Rock</a>. Archbishop Riordan, of <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, and Archbishop Seton, as well as Bishops Byrne, of <a href="../cathen/10704c.htm">Nashville</a>, Keiley. of <a href="../cathen/13488a.htm">Savannah</a>, O'Connor, of <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Newark</a>, N.J., and Northrup, of <a href="../cathen/03630a.htm">Charleston</a>, S.C., are partially indebted to this institution for their training in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. By his brief, <em>Ubi primum</em>, 25 October, 1884, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> raised the American College to the rank of a Pontifical College. The administration of the college is controlled by a board composed of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, New York and Philadelphia. Its internal management and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> are entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, who is assisted by the vice-rector and by the <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a>. The students attend the lectures, and are subject to the academic regulations, of the Urban College of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>. The curriculum of the last-named institution comprises a two-years' course in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and a four-years' course in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Supplementary lectures are given in the American College on the subjects treated in <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>.

<p>The most interesting incident in the history of the American College was the attempt of the Italian government, after the taking of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to seize the college <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. Italian <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of 15 August 1866, and of 7 July, 1867, confiscated to the State the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of religious corporations. A law of 1873 applied the general law to the City of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> had for ten years contended in the courts that these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> did not apply to its <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> but the highest Italian court on the 29th of January, 1884, decided the case in favour of the State. Cardinal McCloskey and <a href="../cathen/04395a.htm">Archbishop Corrigan</a>, his coadjutor, wrote a joint letter on the 3d of March 1884, to the President of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, Chester A. Arthur, begging him to "ask the King of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> for a stay of proceedings, if it be not possible furthermore to exempt the institution as virtually American <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> from the operation of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>". Archbishop Organ, who, for a long time, was secretary of the board of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, having charge of the affairs of the American College, sent special letters to the Secretary of State, Mr. Frelinghuysen, who wrote on the 5th of March, 1884, to Mr. Astor, the American Minister at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, urging him to use his influence with the Italian government to save the college <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> because "although technically the American College is held by the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, it is virtually American <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and its reduction would be attended with the sacrifice of interests almost exclusively American". The efforts of President Arthur, Secretary Frelinghuysen, and Mr. Astor, suggested and urged by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and his coadjutor, saved the college, and on the 28th of March, 1884 Mr. Astor sent a telegram from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, announcing that the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> had been exempted from the effect of the Italian <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of confiscation.
