<h1>The Apostolic Fathers</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writers of the first and second centuries who are known, or are considered, to have had personal relations with some of the Apostles, or to have been so influenced by them that their writings may be held as echoes of genuine Apostolic teaching. Though restricted by some to those who were actually disciples of the Apostles, the term applies by extension to certain writers who were previously believed to have been such, and virtually embraces all the remains of primitive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature antedating the great apologies of the second century, and forming the link of tradition that binds these latter writings to those of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>.

<p>The name was apparently unknown in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature before the end of the seventeenth century. The term <em>Apostolic</em>, however, was commonly used to qualify Churches, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, writings, etc. from the early second century, when St. Ignatius, in the exordium of his Epistle to the Trallians, saluted their Church "after the Apostolic manner." In 1672 <a href="../cathen/04421b.htm">Jean Baptiste Cotelier</a> (Cotelerius) published his "SS. Patrum qui temporibus apostolicis floruerunt opera", which title was abbreviated to "Bibliotheca Patrum Apostolicorum" by L. J. Ittig in his edition (Leipzig, 1699) of the same writings. Since then the term has been universally used.

<p>The list of Fathers included under this title has varied, literary criticism having removed some who were formerly considered as second-century writers, while the publication (Constantinople, 1883) of the <a href="../cathen/04779a.htm">Didache</a> has added one to the list. Chief in importance are the three first-century Bishops: <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">St. Clement of Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">St. Ignatius of Antioch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">St. Polycarp of Smyrna</a>, of whose intimate personal relations with the Apostles there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. Clement, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a> and third <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">successor of St. Peter</a> in the Papacy, "had seen the blessed Apostles [Peter and Paul] and had been conversant with them" (Irenaeus, Adv. Haer., III, iii, 3). Ignatius was the second <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">successor of St. Peter</a> in the See of Antioch (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.36</a>) and during his life in that centre of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> activity may have met with others of the Apostolic band. An accepted tradition, substantiated by the similarity of Ignatius's thought with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the Johannine writings, declares him a disciple of St. John. <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> was "instructed by Apostles" (Irenaeus, op. cit., III, iii, 4) and had been a disciple of St. John (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, op. cit., III, 36; V, 20) whose contemporary he was for nearly twenty years.

<p>Besides these, whose rank as Apostolic Fathers in the strictest sense is undisputed, there are two first-century writers whose place with them is generally conceded: the author of the <a href="../cathen/04779a.htm">Didache</a> and the author of the "Epistle of Barnabas". The former affirms that his teaching is that of the Apostles, and his work, perhaps the earliest extant piece of uninspired <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature, gives colour to his claim; the latter, even if he be not the Apostle and companion of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, is held by many to have written during the last decade of the first century, and may have come under direct Apostolic influence, though his Epistle does not clearly suggest it.

<p>By extension of the term to comprise the extant <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">extra-canonical</a> literature of the sub-Apostolic age, it is made to include the "Shepherd" of Hermas, the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, who was believed to be the one referred to by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/rom016.htm#vrs14">Romans 16:14</a>), but whom a safer tradition makes a brother of <a href="../cathen/12126b.htm">Pope Pius I</a> (c. 140-150); the meagre fragments of the "Expositions of the Discourses of the Lord", by Papias, who may have been a disciple of St. John (<a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, Adv. Haer., V, 331-334), though more probably he received his teaching at second hand from a "presbyter" of that name (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.39</a>); the <a href="../cathen/05008b.htm">"Letter to Diognetus"</a>, the unknown author of which affirms his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">discipleship</a> with the Apostles, but his claim must be taken in the broad sense of conformity in spirit and teaching. In addition to these there were formerly included <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> writings of some of the above Fathers, the "Constitutions" and "Canons of the Apostles" and the works accredited to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius the Areopagite</a>, who, though himself a disciple of the Apostles, was not the author of the works bearing his name. Though generally rejected, the <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> of Pseudo-Clement (Epistola secunda Clementis) is by some considered as being as worthy of a place among the Apostolic Fathers, as is its contemporary, the "Shepherd" of Hermas.

<p>The period of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> covered by these writings extends from the last two decades of the first century for the <a href="../cathen/04779a.htm">Didache</a> (80-100), Clement (c. 97), and probably Pseudo-Barnabas (96-98), through the first half of the second century, the approximate <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> being Ignatius, 110-117; <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, 110-120; Hermas, in its present form, c.150; Papias, c.150. Geographically, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is represented by Clement and Hermas; <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> wrote from <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>, whence also Ignatius sent four of the seven epistles which he wrote on his way from Antioch through <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>; Papias was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07322a.htm">Hierapolis</a> in Phrygia; the <a href="../cathen/04779a.htm">Didache</a> was written in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> or <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>; the letter of Barnabas in Alexandria.

<p>The writings of the Apostolic Fathers are generally epistolary in form, after the fashion of the canonical Epistles, and were written, for the greater part, not for the purpose of instructing <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> at large, but for the guidance of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> or local churches in some passing need. Happily, the writers so amplified their theme that they combine to give a precious picture of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community in the age which follows the death of St. John. Thus Clement, in paternal solicitude for the Churches committed to his care, endeavours to heal a dissension at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> and insists on the principles of unity and submission to authority, as best conducive to peace; Ignatius, fervent in his gratitude to the Churches which solaced him on his way to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, sends back letters of recognition, filled with admonitions against the prevailing <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and highly spiritual exhortations to keep unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in submission to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, in forwarding Ignatian letters to <a href="../cathen/12007c.htm">Philippi</a>, sends, as requested, a simple letter of advice and encouragement. The letter of Pseudo-Barnabas and that to <a href="../cathen/05008b.htm">Diognetus</a>, the one polemical, the other apologetic in tone, while retaining the same form, seem to have in view a wider circle of readers. The other three are in the form of treatises: the <a href="../cathen/04779a.htm">Didache</a>, a manual of moral and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> instruction; the "Shepherd", a book of edification, apocalyptic in form, is an allegorical representation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the faults of her children and their need of penance; the "Expositions" of Papias, an <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> commentary on the Gospels.



<p>Written under such circumstances, the works of the Apostolic Fathers are not characterized by systematic expositions of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> or brilliancy of style. <a href="../cathen/05008b.htm">"Diognetus"</a> alone evidences literary skill and refinement. Ignatius stands out in relief by his striking <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> and depth of view. Each writes for his present purpose, with a view primarily to the actual needs of his auditors, but, in the exuberance of primitive charity and enthusiasm, his heart pours out its message of fidelity to the glorious Apostolic heritage, of encouragement in present difficulties, of solicitude for the future with its threatening dangers. The dominant tone is that of fervent devotion to the brethren in the Faith, revealing the depth and breadth of the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> which was imparted to the writers by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. The letters of the three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, together with the <a href="../cathen/04779a.htm">Didache</a>, voice sincerest praise of the Apostles, whose memory the writers hold in deep filial devotion; but their recognition of the unapproachable superiority of their masters is equally well borne out by the absence in their letters of that distinctly inspired tone that marks the Apostles' writings. More abrupt, however, is the transition between the unpretentious style of the Apostolic Fathers and the scientific form of the treatises of the Fathers of the subsequent periods. The fervent <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, the afterglow of the day of Apostolic spirituality, was not to be found again in such fullness and simplicity. Letters breathing such sympathy and solicitude were held in high esteem by the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and by some were given an authority little inferior to that of the Scriptures. The <a href="../fathers/1010.htm"><em>Epistle of Clement</em></a> was read in the Sunday assemblies at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> during the second century and later (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.16</a> and <a href="../fathers/250104.htm">IV.23</a>); the letter of Barnabas was similarly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>; Hermas was popular throughout <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, but particularly in the West. <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> quoted the <a href="../cathen/04779a.htm">Didache</a> as "Scripture". Some of the Apostolic Fathers are found in the oldest <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> at the end of the canonical writings: Clement was first made known through the <a href="../cathen/04080c.htm">"Codex Alexandrinus"</a>; similarly, Hermas and Pseudo-Barnabas are appended to the canonical books in the <a href="../cathen/04085a.htm">"Codex Sinaiticus"</a>. Standing between the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> era and the literary efflorescence of the late second century, these writers represent the original elements of <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Christian tradition</a>. They make no pretension to treat of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> and practice in a complete and scholarly manner and cannot, therefore, be expected to answer all the problems concerning <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> origins. Their silence on any point does not imply their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of it, much less its denial; nor do their assertions tell all that might be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. The dogmatic value of their teaching is, however, of the highest order, considering the high antiquity of the documents and the competence of the authors to transmit the purest Apostolic <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. This fact did not receive its due appreciation even during the period of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> activity. The increased enthusiasm for <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">positive theology</a> which marked the seventeenth century centred attention on the Apostolic Fathers; since then they have been the eagerly-questioned witnesses to the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> during the first half of the second century. Their teaching is based on the Scriptures, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and on the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. The authority of the latter was decisive. Though the <a href="../cathen/03274a.htm">New Testament canon</a> was not yet, to judge from these writings, definitively fixed, it is significant that with the exception of the Third Epistle of St. John and possibly that of <a href="../bible/phm001.htm">St. Paul to Philemon</a>, every book of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is quoted or alluded to more or less clearly by one or another of the Apostolic Fathers, while the citations from the "apocrypha." are extremely rare. Of equal authority with the written word is that of oral tradition (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.39</a>; <a href="../fathers/1010.htm"><em>Epistle of Clement</em> 7</a>), to which must be traced certain citations of the <a href="../cathen/01225c.htm">"Sayings" of Our Lord and the Apostles</a> not found in the Scriptures.

<p>Meagre as they necessarily are in their testimony, the Apostolic Fathers bear witness to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the chief mysteries of the Divine Unity and Trinity. The Trinitarian formula occurs frequently. If the Divinity of the Holy Ghost is but once obscurely alluded to in Hermas, it must be remembered that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was as yet undisturbed by anti-Trinitarian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. The dominant <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the period was <a href="../cathen/05070c.htm">Docetism</a>, and its refutation furnishes these writers with an occasion to deal at greater length with the Person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. He is the Redeemer of whom men stood in need. Ignatius unhesitatingly calls Him <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (Trall., vii; Eph., i, and passim). The soteriology of the Epistles to the Hebrews forms the basis of their teaching. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is our <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> (<a href="../fathers/1010.htm"><em>Epistle of Clement</em> 36-64</a>) in whose suffering and death is our <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> (Ignat., Eph., i, Magnes., ix; Barnab., v). Diog., ix); whose blood is our ransom (<a href="../fathers/1010.htm"><em>Epistle of Clement</em> 12-21</a>). The fruits of Redemption, while not scientifically treated, are in a general way the destruction of death or of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the gift to man of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> life, and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (Barnab., iv-v, vii, xiv; Did., xvi; <a href="../fathers/1010.htm"><em>Epistle of Clement</em> 24-25</a>; Hermas, Simil., v, 6). Justification is received by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and by works as well; and so clearly is the efficacy of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> insisted upon that it is futile to represent the Apostolic Fathers as failing to comprehend the pertinent teaching of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. The points of view of both <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and St. James are cited and considered complementary (<a href="../fathers/1010.htm"><em>Epistle of Clement</em> 31-35</a>; Ignat. to Polyc., vi). Good works are insisted on by Hermas (Vis., iii, 1 Simil., v, 3), and Barnabas proclaims (c. xix) their necessity for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the "Catholic" Church, as Ignatius for the first time calls it (<a href="../fathers/0109.htm"><em>Smyrn&aelig;ans</em> 8</a>), takes the place of the chosen people; is the <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystical body of Christ</a>, the faithful being the members thereof, united by oneness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope, and by a charity which prompts to mutual assistance. This unity is secured by the hierarchical organization of the ministry and the due submission of inferiors to authority. On this point the teaching of the Apostolic Fathers seems to stand for a marked development in advance of the practice of the Apostolic period. But it is to be noted that the familiar tone in which episcopal authority is treated precludes the possibility of its being a novelty. The <a href="../cathen/04779a.htm">Didache</a> may yet deal with "prophets", "Apostles", and itinerant missionaries (x-xi, xiii-xiv), but this is not a stage in development. It is anomalous, outside the current of development. Clement and Ignatius present the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, organized and complete, with its orders of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the Eucharistic liturgy and administrators of temporalities. Clement's Epistle is the philosophy of "Apostolicity," and its corollary, episcopal succession. Ignatius gives in abundance practical illustrations of what Clement sets forth in principle. For Ignatius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is the centre of unity (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm">Ephesians 4</a>), the authority whom all must obey as they would <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in whose place the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> rules (<a href="../fathers/0110.htm"><em>Polycarp</em> 6</a>; <a href="../fathers/0105.htm"><em>Magnesians</em> 6 and 13</a>; <a href="../fathers/0109.htm"><em>Smyrn&aelig;ans</em> 8 and 11</a>; <a href="../fathers/0106.htm"><em>Trallians</em> 12</a>); for unity with and submission to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is the only security of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Supreme in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is he who holds the seat of St. Peter at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The intervention of Clement in the affairs of <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> and the language of Ignatius in speaking of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the exordium of his Epistle to the Romans must be understood in the light of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> charge to St. Peter. One rounds out the other. The deepest reverence for the memory of St. Peter is visible in the writings of Clement and Ignatius. They couple his name with that of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, and this effectually disproves the antagonism between these two Apostles which the T&uuml;bingen theory postulated in tracing the pretended development of a united church from the discordant Petrine and Pauline factions. Among the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> alluded to is Baptism, to which Ignatius refers (<a href="../fathers/0110.htm"><em>Polycarp</em> 2</a> and <a href="../fathers/0109.htm"><em>Smyrn&aelig;ans</em> 8</a>), and of which Hermas speaks as the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> way of entrance to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> (Vis., iii, 3, 5; Simil., ix, 16), the way from death to life (Simil., viii, 6), while the <a href="../cathen/04779a.htm">Didache</a> deals with it liturgically (vii). The Eucharist is mentioned in the <a href="../fathers/0714.htm">Didache (14)</a> and by Ignatius, who uses the term to signify the "flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Saviour Jesus Christ</a>" (<a href="../fathers/0109.htm"><em>Smyrn&aelig;ans</em> 7</a>; <a href="../fathers/0104.htm"><em>Ephesians</em> 20</a>; <a href="../fathers/0108.htm"><em>Philadelphians</em> 4</a>). Penance is the theme of Hermas, and is urged as a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and a possible recourse for him who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> once after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> (Vis., iii, 7; Simil., viii, 6, 8, 9, 11). The <a href="../cathen/04779a.htm">Didache</a> refers to a confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> (iv, xiv) as does Barnabas (xix). An exposition of the dogmatic teaching of individual Fathers will be found under their respective names.

<p>The Apostolic Fathers, as a group, are found in no one <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>. The literary history of each will be found in connection with the individual studies. The first edition was that of Cotelerius, above referred to (Paris, 1672). It contained Barnabas, Clement, Hermas, Ignatius, and <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>. A reprint (Antwerp, 1698-1700; Amsterdam, 1724), by Jean Leclerc (Clericus), contained much additional matter. The latest editions are those of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> Bishop, J.B. Lightfoot, "The Apostolic Fathers" (5 vols., London, 1889-1890); abbreviated edition, Lightfoot-Harmer, London, I vol., 1893; Gebhardt, Harnack, and Zahn, "Patrum Apostolicorum Opera" (Leipzig, 1901); and F. X. <a href="../cathen/06322c.htm">von Funk</a>, "Patres Apostolici" (2d ed., T&uuml;bingen, 1901), in all of which abundant reference will be found to the literature of the two preceding centuries. The last named work first appeared (T&uuml;bingen, vol. I, 1878, 1887; vol. II,, 1881) as a fifth edition of Hefele's "Opera Patr. Apostolicorum" (T&uuml;bingen, 1839; 4th ed., 1855) enriched with notes (critical, <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a>, historical), prolegomena, indexes, and a Latin version. The second edition meets all just demands of a critical presentation of these ancient and important writings, and in its introduction and notes offers the best <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> treatise on the subject.
