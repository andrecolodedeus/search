<h1>The Apostolic Union of Secular Priests</h1>  

<p>An association of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> who observe a simple rule embodying the common <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of their state, afford mutual assistance in the functions of the ministry, and keep themselves in the spirit of their holy vocation by spiritual conferences. Its object is the sanctification of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> in their missionary lives among the people. Its spirit is a personal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. It was established in the seventeenth century by the <a href="../cathen/07439b.htm">Venerable Bartholomew Holzhauser</a>, and was revived and reorganized in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> about forty years ago (from 1913) by Canon Lebeurier, who in 1913 remained its president-general. One of the first acts of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, 20 December, 1903, was to take the Union under his special protection, whilst increasing its <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> and spiritual favours. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of the Holy Father (Acta S. Sed., XXXVI, 594) recites the establishment of the Union in 1862, and its spread to a great number of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> throughout the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, South American, <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>, and parts of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. The Holy Father proclaims the fact that he was a member of it, and had experienced its utility and excellence, and admits the advantages derived from it, eleven after his elevation to the episcopate. The brief goes on to summarize its organization. Proposing as it does to all its associates a uniform rule of life, monthly reunions and spiritual conferences, and the submission of a bulletin regularly to the superior, it strengthens union among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and unites by a bond of spiritual fraternity <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who are scattered far apart. The dangers of solitude are removed, and there is a concentrated effort on the part of all to attain the common end. Each <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> under these conditions devotes himself to the well-being and perfection of all, and, though prevented by the cares of his ministry from enjoying the advantages of living in community, he does not feel that he is deprived of the benefits of the religious <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; nor are the counsels and assistance of his brothers wanting. The brief then recites the approval of the institute by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in <a href="../cathen/01640a.htm">Apostolic letters</a> of 31 May, 1880, and again in 1887, when he gave it as a cardinal-protector the Cardinal Vicar of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Monsignor Lucido Parrocchi. Then follows a recital of the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> and special privileges granted to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who are members. These may be found in Beringer, ed. 1905, II, 450.

<p>The means by which the ends proposed are attained are as follows: <ul><li>The rule is the bond of this <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, and its vital principle; insisting on the fact that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> ought to study, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and imitate <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, it maps out the life of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Apostolic Union, indicating to them the spiritual exercises and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> study for each day, each week, each month, each year, and counsels with regard to the holy ministry. <li>The monthly bulletin, which is a kind of examination on the principal exercises in the rule of life. It is so arranged that the member can indicate every day his performance of the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> imposed. There is a code of signs employed for this purpose. The bulletin is sent monthly to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> superior, who returns it with his comments. This monthly bulletin, marked carefully each day and examined by the superior, assures regularity, maintains fervour, guards against failures and diminishes faults; it establishes the spirit of order, self-denial, obedience and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and secures the benefits of <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual direction</a>. <li>Reunions are more or less frequent according to circumstances. Where the associates are numerous, they are divided into groups, each of which has its reunion at a central point. It is quite a common practice for the members to make a monthly retreat in common. They also assemble, wherever circumstances permit, once a year to make a retreat of at least five days. <li>The works of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> supported by the associates are the recruiting of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the nurture of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> vocations. <li>The common life. The Apostolic Union favours the practice of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the same <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> living in common wherever this can be advantageously done. The associates recite daily a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to which is attached a special <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>. <li>Organization. The different <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> organizations canonically erected are united under a president-general, who has over him a cardinal-protector. The common bond is simply the adoption of the general rule of the Union. Each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> association chooses its superior, and the associates are bound to the superior by the practice of the monthly bulletin.</ul> There is an organ, "Etudes Ecclesiastiques", which is a monthly review dedicated to the interests of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>.
