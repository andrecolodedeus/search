<h1>The Archdiocese of Adelaide</h1>  

<p>Centred in Adelaide, capital of South Australia. It comprises all the territory of South Australia south of the counties of <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a> and Burra to Northwest Bend. The River Murray from this point forms the boundary to the confines of New South Wales. The counties of Flinders, Musgrave, and Jervois form the western portion of the Archdiocese, with the adjacent islands. Area, 40,320 square miles. South Australia was founded by a chartered company in 1836. It was intended to be a "free" (that is, non-convict) <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> colony. "Papists and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>" were to have been excluded. A few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were, however, among the first immigrants. <a href="../cathen/15121a.htm">Dr. Ullathorne</a> (Sydney) visited Adelaide in June, 1840. Governor Gawler roughly refused the Government <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> (commonly used for religious services) "either to the Popish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to go through his Mass, or to the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to be present at it." A store was lent by a generous <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, and there the first <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated for a congregation of about fifty. The first resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was the Rev. William Benson (1841-44). Adelaide (hitherto part of the Diocese of Sydney) was created an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> in 1843. Its first Bishop was the Right Rev. Francis Murphy, the first <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in Australasia. At the census of 1844 there were in South Australia only 1,055 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in a total white population of 17,366. Bishop Murphy had then only one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, no presbytery or <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and his only church was a small weather-board store which was rented. Three years of hard poverty, broken by a <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">convert's</a> gifts, were followed by four years (1847-51) of State aid for churches and <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of religion (withdrawn by the first elective parliament in 1852) and by capitation grants to denominational <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (1847-51). The wild exodus to the gold-fields of <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a> in 1851 almost emptied Adelaide of its adult male inhabitants. Some of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> had to seek missions elsewhere, and the Bishop and the two who remained had, until timely aid from the gold-fields arrived, to exist on a total income of 8s. 6d. per week, in a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> burdened with a <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> of &#167;4,000. Prosperous years followed. The <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a> were introduced in 1846; Jesuits, 1848; <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, 1857; Sisterhood of St. Joseph founded 1867; secular public instruction established 1878; Adelaide created an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, and part of its territory formed into the <a href="../cathen/12283d.htm">Diocese of Port Augusta</a>, 1887. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Adelaide have been: Bishops Francis Murphy (1844-58); Patrick B. Geoghegan, O.S.F. (1858-64); Lawrence B. Shiel, O.S.F. (1866-72); <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> Christopher A. Reynolds (1873-93); and John O Reilly, transferred from Port Augusta (1895). Archbishop O'Reilly, who relieved his former diocese of a heavy <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>, has gone far towards performing a like service for that of Adelaide. Two gifted scientists of the Archdiocese were Father Hinterocker, S.J., a skilled naturalist. and Father Julian Tenison Woods, a prolific writer on Australian geology. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> weekly, "The Southern Cross" (Adelaide).
