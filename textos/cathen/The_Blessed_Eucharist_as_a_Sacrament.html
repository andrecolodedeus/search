<h1>The Blessed Eucharist as a Sacrament</h1>  

<p>Since Christ is present under the appearances of <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> in a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacramental</a> way, the Blessed Eucharist is unquestionably a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Indeed, in the Eucharist the definition of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Christian sacrament</a> as "an outward sign of an inward grace instituted by Christ" is verified.

<p>The investigation into the precise <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Blessed Sacrament of the Altar, whose existence <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> do not deny, is beset with a number of difficulties. Its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> certainly does not consist in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">Consecration</a> or the Communion, the former being merely the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificial</a> action, the latter the reception of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and not the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> itself. The question may eventually be reduced to this whether or not the sacramentality is to be sought for in the Eucharistic <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> or in the Body and Blood of Christ hidden beneath them. The majority of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> rightly respond to the query by saying, that neither the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> themselves nor the Body and Blood of Christ by themselves, but the union of both factors constitute the moral whole of the Sacrament of the Altar. The <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> undoubtedly belong to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, since it is by means of them, and not by means of the invisible Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that the Eucharist possesses the outward sign of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Equally <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> is it, that the Body and the Blood of Christ belong to the concept of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, because it is not the mere unsubstantial appearances which are given for the food of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> but Christ concealed beneath the appearances. The twofold number of the Eucharistic elements of <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> does not interfere with the unity of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of refection embraces both eating and drinking, nor do our meals in consequence double their number. In the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a>, there is a question of even higher relation, in that the separated <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> also represent the mystical separation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Body and Blood or the unbloody <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">Sacrifice</a> of the Eucharistic Lamb. The Sacrament of the Altar may be regarded under the same aspects as the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, provided only it be ever kept in view that the Eucharist is a permanent <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Every <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> may be considered either in itself or with reference to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom it concerns.

<p>Passing over the Institution, which is discussed elsewhere in connection with the words of Institution, the only essentially important points remaining are the outward sign (<a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>) and inward grace (effects of Communion), to which may be added the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of Communion for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. In regard to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> concerned, we distinguish between the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> of the Eucharist and its recipient or subject.
<h2 id="section1">The matter or Eucharistic elements</h2>

<p>There are two Eucharistic elements, <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>, which constitute the remote <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the Sacrament of the Altar, while the proximate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> can be none other than the Eucharistic appearances under which the Body and Blood of Christ are truly present.

<h3>Bread</h3>

<p>The first element is wheaten bread (<em>panis triticeus</em>), without which the "confection of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacrament</a> does not take place" (Missale Romanum: De defectibus, sect. 3), Being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> bread, the <a href="../cathen/07489d.htm">Host</a> must be baked, since mere flour is not bread. Since, moreover, the bread required is that formed of wheaten flour, not every kind of flour is allowed for validity, such, e.g., as is ground from rye, oats, barley, Indian corn or maize, though these are all botanically classified as grain (<em>frumentum</em>), On the other hand, the different varieties of wheat (as spelt, amel-corn, etc.) are valid, inasmuch as they can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> botanically to be genuine wheat. The <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of wheaten bread is <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a> immediately from the words of Institution: "The Lord took bread" (<em>ton arton</em>), in connection with which it may be remarked, that in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> <em>bread</em> (<em>artos</em>), without any qualifying addition, always signifies wheaten bread. No doubt, too, Christ adhered unconditionally to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> custom of using only wheaten bread in the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> Supper, and by the words, "Do this for a commemoration of me", commanded its use for all succeeding times. In addition to this, uninterrupted <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a>, whether it be the testimony of the Fathers or the practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, shows wheaten bread to have played such an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> part, that even <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> would be loath to regard rye bread or barley bread as a proper element for the celebration of the Lord's Supper.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> maintains an easier position in the controversy respecting the use of fermented or unfermented bread. By leavened bread (<em>fermentum, zymos</em>) is meant such wheaten bread as requires leaven or yeast in its preparation and baking, while unleavened bread (<em>azyma, azymon</em>) is formed from a mixture of wheaten flour and water, which has been kneaded to dough and then baked. After the Greek Patriarch <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Michael C&aelig;rularius</a> of Constantinople had sought in 1053 to palliate the renewed rupture with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by means of the controversy, concerning unleavened bread, the two Churches, in the Decree of Union at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, in 1439, came to the unanimous <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> decision, that the distinction between leavened and unleavened bread did not interfere with the confection of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, though for just reasons based upon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> and practice, the Latins were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to retain unleavened bread, while the Greeks still held on to the use of leavened (cf, <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, Enchirid., Freiburg, 1908, no, 692), Since the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">Schismatics</a> had before the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> entertained <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> as to the validity of the Latin custom, a brief defense of the use of unleavened bread will not be out of place here. <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Pope Leo IX</a> had as early as 1054 issued a protest against <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Michael C&aelig;rularius</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., CXLIII, 775), in which he referred to the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptural</a> fact, that according to the three <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptics</a> the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a> was celebrated "on the first day of the <a href="../cathen/02171a.htm">azymes</a>" and so the <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> received its solemn sanction from the example of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, moreover, were accustomed even the day before the fourteenth of Nisan to get rid of all the leaven which chanced to be in their dwellings, that so they might from that <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> on partake exclusively of the so-called <em>mazzoth</em> as bread. As regards <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a>, it is not for us to settle the dispute of learned authorities, as to whether or not in the first six or eight centuries the Latins also celebrated <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> with leavened bread (<a href="../cathen/14027c.htm">Sirmond</a>, <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, <a href="../cathen/08699a.htm">Kraus</a>) or have observed the present <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> ever since the time of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> (<a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a>, Probst). Against the Greeks it suffices to call attention to the historical fact that in the Orient the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a> and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> have used unleavened bread from time immemorial, and that according to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (<a href="../fathers/101612.htm"><em>Commentary on Matthew</em>, XII.6</a>) the people of the East "sometimes", therefore not as a rule, made use of leavened bread in their <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Liturgy</a>. Besides, there is considerable force in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> argument that the fermenting process with yeast and other leaven, does not affect the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the bread, but merely its <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. The reasons of congruity advanced by the Greeks in behalf of leavened bread, which would have us consider it as a beautiful symbol of the <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a>, as well as an attractive representation of the savor of this heavenly Food, will be most willingly accepted, provided only that due consideration be given to the grounds of propriety set forth by the Latins with <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> (<a href="../summa/4074.htm#article4">III:74:4</a>) namely, the example of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the aptitude of unleavened bread to be regarded as a symbol of the purity of His Sacred Body, free from all corruption of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and finally the instruction of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/1co005.htm#vrs8">1 Corinthians 5:8</a>) to keep the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a> not with the leaven of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>".


<h3>Wine</h3>

<p>The second Eucharistic element required is <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> of the grape (<em>vinum de vite</em>). Hence are excluded as invalid, not only the juices extracted and prepared from other fruits (as cider and perry), but also the so-called artificial wines, even if their chemical constitution is identical with the genuine juice of the grape. The <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> of the grape is not so much the result of the authoritative decision of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as it is presupposed by her (Council of Trent, Sess. XIII, cap. iv), and is based upon the example and command of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who at the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a> certainly converted the natural <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> of grapes into His Blood, This is <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a> partly from the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, which required the head of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to pass around the "cup of benediction" (<em>calix benedictionis</em>) containing the <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> of grapes, partly, and especially, from the express declaration of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that henceforth He would not drink of the "fruit of the vine" (<em>genimen vitis</em>). The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is aware of no other <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> and in this respect she has ever been one with the Greeks. The ancient Hydroparastat&aelig;, or <a href="../cathen/01660d.htm">Aquarians</a>, who used water instead of <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>, were <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in her eyes. The counter-argument of Ad. Harnack ["Texte und Untersuchungen", new series, VII, 2 (1891), 115 sqq.], that the most ancient of Churches was indifferent as to the use of <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>, and more concerned with the action of eating and drinking than with the elements of <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>, loses all its force in view not only of the earliest literature on the subject (the <a href="../cathen/04779a.htm">Didache</a>, Ignatius, <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a>, Iren&aelig;us, <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>, <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>), but also of non-Catholic and <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> writings, which bear testimony to the use of <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> as the only and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> elements of the Blessed Sacrament. On the other hand, a very ancient <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which, however, has nothing to do with the validity of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, prescribes that a little water be added to the <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> before the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">Consecration</a> (Decr. pro Armenis: <em>aqua modicissima</em>), a practice, whose legitimacy the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXII, can. ix) established under pain of <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. The rigor of this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may be traced to the ancient custom of the Romans and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who mixed water with the strong southern wines (<em>see</em> <a href="../bible/pro009.htm#vrs2">Proverbs 9:2</a>), to the expression of <em>calix mixtus</em> found in <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> (<a href="../fathers/0126.htm#chapter65"><em>First Apology</em> 65</a>), Iren&aelig;us (<a href="../fathers/0103502.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> V.2.3</a>), and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> (<a href="../fathers/050663.htm">Epistle 63, no. 13 sq.</a>), and especially to the deep symbolical meaning contained in the mingling, inasmuch as thereby are represented the flowing of blood and water from the side of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Crucified Savior</a> and the intimate union of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> with Christ (cf. <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, Sess. XXII, cap. vii).
<h2 id="section2">The sacramental form or the words of consecration</h2>

<p>In proceeding to verify the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, which is always made up of words, we may start from the dubitable fact, that Christ did not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> by the mere fiat of His <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a>, which found no expression in articulate utterance, but by pronouncing the words of Institution: "This is my body . . . this is my blood", and that by the addition: "Do this for a commemoration of me", He commanded the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> to follow His example. Were the words of Institution a mere declarative utterance of the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>, which might have taken place in the "benediction" unannounced and articulately unexpressed, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and their <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">successors</a> would, according to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> example and mandate, have been <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> in this mute manner also, a consequence which is altogether at variance with the deposit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a> (De Sacro altaris myst., IV, vi) before his elevation to the pontificate did hold the opinion, which later <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> branded as "temerarious", that Christ <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> without words by means of the mere "benediction". Not many <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, however, followed him in this regard, among the few being Ambrose Catharinus, Cheffontaines, and Hoppe, by far the greater number preferring to stand by the unanimous testimony of the Fathers. Meanwhile, <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> also insisted most urgently that at least in the case of the celebrating <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the words of Institution were prescribed as the sacramental <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. It was, moreover, not until its comparatively recent adherence in the seventeenth century to the famous "Confessio fidei orthodoxa" of Peter Mogilas (cf. Kimmel, "Monum. fidei eccl. orient.", Jena, 1850, I, p. 180), that the Schismatical Greek Church adopted the view, according to which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> does not at all <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> by virtue of the words of Institution, but only by means of the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> occurring shortly after them and expressing in the Oriental <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Liturgies</a> a petition to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, "that the <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> may be converted into the Body and Blood of Christ". Were the Greeks justified in maintaining this position, the immediate result would be, that the Latins who have no such thing as the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> in their present Liturgy, would possess neither the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a> nor the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>. Fortunately, however, the Greeks can be shown the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of their ways from their own writings, since it can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, that they themselves formerly placed the form of <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a> in the words of Institution. Not only did such renowned Fathers as <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> (<a href="../fathers/0126.htm#chapter66"><em>First Apology</em> 66</a>), Iren&aelig;us (<a href="../fathers/0103502.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> V.2.3</a>), <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> (<a href="../fathers/29083.htm"><em>The Great Catechism</em>, no. 37</a>), <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Hom. i, de prod. Jud&aelig;, n. 6), and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">John Damascene</a> (<a href="../fathers/33044.htm"><em>Exposition of the Faith</em> IV.13</a>) hold this view, but the ancient Greek Liturgies bear testimony to it, so that <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Cardinal Bessarion</a> in 1439 at Florence called the attention of his fellow-countrymen to the fact, that as soon as the words of Institution have been pronounced, supreme homage and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoration</a> are due to the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, even though the famous <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> follows some time after.

<p>The objection that the mere historical recitation of the words of Institution taken from the narrative of the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a> possesses no intrinsic consecratory force, would be well founded, did the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> merely intend by means of them to narrate some historical event rather than pronounce them with the practical purpose of effecting the conversion, or if he pronounced them in his own name and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> instead of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> and instrumental <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> he is. Neither of the two suppositions holds in the case of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who really <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intends</a> to celebrate <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>. Hence, though the Greeks may in the best of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> go on <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> maintaining that they <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> exclusively in their <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a>, they do, nevertheless, as in the case of the Latins, actually <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> by means of the words of Institution contained in their <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Liturgies</a>, if Christ has instituted these words as the words of consecration and the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> of the sacrament. We may in fact go a step farther and assert, that the words of Institution constitute the only and wholly adequate form of the Eucharist and that, consequently, the words of the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> possess no inherent consecratory value. The contention that the words of the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> have joint <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> value and constitute the partial form of the sacrament, was indeed supported by <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> Latin <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, as <a href="../cathen/15005a.htm">Toutt&eacute;e</a>, <a href="../cathen/12769a.htm">Renaudot</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09106a.htm">Lebrun</a>. Though this opinion cannot be condemned as <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since it allows to the words of Institution their essential, though partial, consecratory value, appears nevertheless to be intrinsically repugnant. For, since the act of Consecration cannot remain, as it were, in a state of suspense, but is completed in an instant of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, there arises the dilemma: Either the words of Institution alone and, therefore, not the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a>, are productive of the conversion, or the words of the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> alone have such power and not the words of Institution. Of more considerable importance is the circumstance that the whole question came up for discussion in the council for union held at Florence in 1439. <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Pope Eugene IV</a> urged the Greeks to come to a unanimous agreement with the Roman <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and subscribe to the words of Institution as alone constituting the sacramental form, and to drop the contention that the words of the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> also possessed a partial consecratory force. But when the Greeks, not without foundation, pleaded that a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> decision would reflect with shame upon their whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> past, the ecumenical synod was satisfied with the oral declaration of <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Cardinal Bessarion</a> recorded in the minutes of the council for 5 July, 1439 (P.G., CLXI, 491), namely, that the Greeks follow the universal teaching of the Fathers, especially of "blessed <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">John Chrysostom</a>, familiarly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us", according to whom the "Divine words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Redeemer</a> contain the full and entire force of <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a>".

<p>The venerable antiquity of the Oriental <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a>, its peculiar position in the <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">Canon of the Mass</a>, and its interior spiritual unction, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">oblige</a> the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> to determine its <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> value and to account for its use. Take, for instance, the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian</a> Liturgy: "We implore and beseech Thee, O Lord, to send forth the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and His Power upon this <a href="../cathen/02749a.htm">Bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">Chalice</a> and convert them into the Body and Blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a>." Since this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> always follows after the words of Institution have been pronounced, the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> question arises, as to how it may be made to harmonize with the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which alone possess the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> power. Two explanations have been suggested which, however, can be merged in one. The first view considers the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> to be a mere declaration of the fact, that the conversion has already taken place, and that in the conversion just as essential a part is to be attributed to the Holy Spirit as Co-Consecrator as in the allied <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>. Since, however, because of the brevity of the actual instant of conversion, the part taken by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> could not be expressed, the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> takes us back in <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> to the precious moment and regards the Consecration as just about to occur. A similar purely <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> retrospective transfer is met with in other portions of the Liturgy, as in the Mass for the Dead, wherein the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for the departed as if they were still upon their bed of agony and could still be rescued from the gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Thus considered, the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> refers us back to the Consecration as the center about which all the significance contained in its words revolves. A second explanation is based, not upon the enacted Consecration, but upon the approaching Communion, inasmuch as the latter, being the effective means of uniting us more closely in the organized body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, brings forth in our hearts the <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystical</a> Christ, as is read in the Roman Canon of the Mass: "Ut <em>nobis</em> corpus et sanguis fiat", i.e. that it may be made <em>for us</em> the body and blood. It was in this purely mystical manner that the Greeks themselves explained the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> at the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, Collect. Concil., XXXI, 106). Yet since much more is contained in the plain words than this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and deep <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>, it is desirable to combine both explanations into one, and so we regard the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a>, both in point of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a> and of time, as the significant connecting link, placed midway between the Consecration and the Communion in order to emphasize the part taken by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in the Consecration of <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>, and, on the other hand, with the help of the same Holy Spirit to obtain the realization of the true Presence of the Body and Blood of Christ by their fruitful effects on both <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and people.

<h2 id="section3">The effects of the holy Eucharist</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> regarding the effects or the fruits of <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> centres around two <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>: (a) the union with Christ by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and (b) the spiritual repast of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Both <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are often verified in one and same effect of <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>.

<h3>The union with Christ by love</h3>

<p>The first and principal effect of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> is union with Christ by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> (Decr. pro Armenis: <em>adunatio ad Christum</em>), which union as such does not consist in the sacramental reception of the <a href="../cathen/07489d.htm">Host</a>, but in the spiritual and mystical union with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself designated the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of Communion as a union <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: "He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh blood, abideth in me, and I in him" (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#vrs57">John 6:57</a>). <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a> (Hom. in Joan., IV, xvii) beautifully represents this mystical union as the fusion of our being into that of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">God-man</a>, as "when melted wax is fused with other wax". Since the Sacrament of Love is not satisfied with an increase of habitual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> only, but tends especially to fan the flame of actual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to an intense ardor, the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> is specifically distinguished from the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and hence it is precisely in this latter effect that <a href="../cathen/14319a.htm">Francisco Su&aacute;rez</a>, recognizes the so-called "grace of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>", which otherwise is so hard to discern. It stands to reason that the essence of this union by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> consists neither in a natural union with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> analogous to that between <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, nor in a <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a>, nor finally in a pantheistical deification of the communicant, but simply in a <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> but wonderful union with Christ by the bond of the most ardent charity. Hence the chief effect of a worthy Communion is to a certain extent a foretaste of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, in fact the anticipation and pledge of our future union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">Beatific Vision</a>. He alone can properly estimate the precious boon which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> possess in the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, who knows how to ponder these <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> to their utmost depth. The immediate result of this union with Christ by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is the bond of charity existing between the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> themselves as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> says: "For we being many, are one bread, one body, all that partake of one bread" (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#vrs17">1 Corinthians 10:17</a>). And so the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">Communion of Saints</a> is not merely an ideal union by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and grace, but an eminently real union, mysteriously constituted, maintained, and guaranteed by partaking in common of one and the same Christ.

<h3>The spiritual repast of the soul</h3>

<p>A second fruit of this union with Christ by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is an increase of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the worthy communicant. Here let it be remarked at the outset, that the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> does not <em>per se</em> constitute a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in the state of grace as do the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the dead (<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and penance), but presupposes such a state. It is, therefore, one of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the living. It is as impossible for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the state of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to receive this <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Heavenly Bread</a> with profit, as it is for a corpse to assimilate food and drink. Hence the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XIII. can. v), in opposition to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, purposely <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a>, that the "chief fruit of the Eucharist does not consist in the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>". For though Christ said of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">Chalice</a>: "This is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many unto remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs28">Matthew 26:28</a>), He had in view an effect of the sacrifice, not of the sacrament; for He did not say that His Blood would be drunk unto remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but shed for that purpose. It is for this very reason that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#vrs28">1 Corinthians 11:28</a>) demands that rigorous "self-examination", in order to avoid the heinous offense of being guilty of the Body and the Blood of the Lord by "eating and drinking unworthily", and that the Fathers insist upon nothing so energetically as upon a pure and innocent <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. In spite of the principles just laid down, the question might be asked, if the Blessed Sacrament could not at times <em>per accidens</em> free the communicant from mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if he approached the Table of the Lord unconscious of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> state of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Presupposing what is self-evident, that there is question neither of a <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">conscious</a> <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> Communion nor a lack of imperfect <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> (<em>attritio</em>), which would altogether hinder the <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justifying</a> effect of the sacrament, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> incline to the opinion, that in such exceptional cases the Eucharist can restore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the state of grace, but all without exception deny the possibility of the reviviscence of a sacrilegious or unfruitful Communion after the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> proper moral <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> has been effected, the Eucharist being different in this respect from the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which imprint a <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">confirmation</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>). Together with the increase of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> there is associated another effect, namely, a certain spiritual relish or delight of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (<em>delectatio spiritualis</em>). Just as food and drink delight and refresh the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so does this "Heavenly Bread containing within itself all sweetness" produce in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the devout communicant ineffable bliss, which, however, is not to be confounded with an emotional <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or with sensible sweetness. Although both may occur as the result of a special grace, its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is manifested in a certain cheerful and willing fervor in all that regards Christ and His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and in the conscious fulfillment of the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of one's state of life, a disposition of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is perfectly compatible with interior desolation and spiritual dryness. A good Communion is recognized less in the transitory sweetness of the emotions than in its lasting practical effects on the conduct of our daily lives.

<h3>Forgiveness of venial sin and preservation from mortal sin</h3>

<p>Though <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> does not <em>per se</em> remit mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it has nevertheless the third effect of "blotting out venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and preserving the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" (Council of Trent, Sess. XIII, cap. ii). The <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> is not merely a food, but a medicine as well. The destruction of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and of all affection to it, is readily understood on the basis of the two central <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> mentioned above. Just as material food banishes minor bodily weaknesses and preserves <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> physical strength from being impaired, so does this food of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> remove our lesser spiritual ailments and preserve us from spiritual death. As a union based upon <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> cleanses with its purifying flame the smallest stains which adhere to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and at the same time serves as an effective prophylactic against grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. It only remains for us to ascertain with clearness the manner in which this preservative influence against relapse into mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is exerted. According to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/13120c.htm">Roman Catechism</a>, it is effected by the allaying of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, which is the chief source of deadly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, particularly of impurity. Therefore it is that spiritual writers recommend <a href="../cathen/06278a.htm">frequent Communion</a> as the most effective remedy against impurity, since its powerful influence is felt even after other means have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> unavailing (cf. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>: <a href="../summa/4079.htm#article6">III:79:6</a>). Whether or not the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> is directly conducive to the remission of the temporal punishment due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is disputed by <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<a href="../summa/4079.htm#article5">III:79:5</a>), since the Blessed Sacrament of the Altar was not instituted as a means of satisfaction; it does, however, produce an indirect effect in this regard, which is proportioned to the communicant's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and devotion. The case is different as regards the effects of grace in behalf of a third party. The <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> custom of the faithful of "offering their Communion" for relations, friends, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> departed, is to be considered as possessing unquestionable value, in the first place, because an earnest <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of petition in the presence of the Spouse of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> will readily find a hearing, and then, because the fruits of Communion as a means of satisfaction for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be applied to a third <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and especially <em>per modum suffragii</em> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>.

<h3>The pledge of our resurrection</h3>

<p>As a last effect we may mention that the Eucharist is the "pledge of our <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">glorious resurrection</a> and <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">eternal happiness</a>" (Council of Trent, Sess. XIII, cap. ii), according to the promise of Christ: "He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, hath everlasting life: and I will raise him up on the last day." Hence the chief reason why the ancient Fathers, as Ignatius (<a href="../fathers/0104.htm"><em>Letter to the Ephesians</em> 20</a>), Iren&aelig;us (<a href="../fathers/0103418.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> IV.18.4</a>), and <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (<a href="../fathers/0316.htm"><em>On the Resurrection of the Flesh</em> 8</a>), as well as later <a href="../cathen/11560a.htm">patristic</a> writers, insisted so strongly upon our future <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, was the circumstance that it is the door by which we enter upon unending <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. There can be nothing incongruous or improper in the fact that the body also shares in this effect of Communion, since by its physical contact with the Eucharist <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and hence (indirectly) with the living Flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it acquires a moral <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to its future <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, even as the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Mother of God</a>, inasmuch as she was the former abode of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> made flesh, acquired a moral claim to her own bodily <a href="../cathen/02006b.htm">assumption</a> into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. The further discussion as to whether some "physical <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>" (<a href="../cathen/04330a.htm">Contenson</a>) or a "sort of germ of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>" (Heimbucher) is implanted in the body of the communicant, has no sufficient foundation in the teaching of the Fathers and may, therefore, be dismissed without any injury to <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>.
<h2 id="section4">The necessity of the holy Eucharist for salvation</h2>

<p>We distinguish two kinds of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, <ul><li>the necessity of means (<em>necessitas medii</em>) and <li>the necessity of precept (<em>necessitas pr&aelig;cepti</em>).</ul> In the first sense a thing or action is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> because without it a given end cannot be attained; the eye, e.g. is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for vision. The second sort of necessity is that which is imposed by the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> of a superior, e.g. the necessity of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. As regards Communion a further distinction must be made between infants and adults. It is easy to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that in the case of infants <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, either as a means or as of <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precept</a>. Since they have not as yet attained to the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, they are free from the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; consequently, the only question is whether Communion is, like <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for them as a means of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> under pain of <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>, <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> rejects such a necessity (Sess. XXI, can. iv) and declares that the custom of the primitive <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of giving <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> to children was not based upon the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of its necessity to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but upon the circumstances of the times (Sess. XXI, cap. iv). Since according to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> teaching (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs1">Romans 8:1</a>) there is "no condemnation" for those who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, every child that dies in its <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> innocence, even without Communion, must go straight to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. This latter position was that usually taken by the Fathers, with the exception of St. Augustine, who from the universal custom of the <a href="../cathen/04170b.htm">Communion of children</a> drew the conclusion of its necessity for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/04170b.htm">COMMUNION OF CHILDREN</a>). On the other hand, Communion is prescribed for adults, not only by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but also by a Divine command (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#vrs50">John 6:50 sqq.</a>), though for its absolute necessity as a means to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> there is no more evidence than in the case of infants. For such a necessity could be established only on the supposition that Communion per se constituted a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in the state of grace or that this state could not be preserved without Communion. Neither supposition is correct. Not the first, for the simple reason that the Blessed Eucharist, being a sacrament of the living, presupposes the state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>; not the second, because in case of necessity, such as might arise, e.g., in a long sea-voyage, the Eucharistic <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> may be supplied by <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual graces</a>. It is only when viewed in this light that we can understand how the primitive Church, without going counter to the Divine command, withheld the Eucharist from certain sinners even on their deathbeds. There is, however, a moral necessity on the part of adults to receive <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, as a means, for instance, of overcoming violent <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, or as a <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">viaticum</a> for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in danger of death. Eminent divines, like <a href="../cathen/14319a.htm">Francisco Su&aacute;rez</a>, claim that the Eucharist, if not absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, is at least a relatively and morally <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> means to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, in the sense that no adult can long sustain his spiritual, <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> life who neglects on principle to approach <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>. This view is supported, not only by the solemn and earnest words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when He Promised the Eucharist, and by the very nature of the sacrament as the spiritual food and medicine of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, but also by the fact of the helplessness and perversity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and by the daily experience of confessors and directors of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p>Since Christ has left us no definite precept as to the frequency with which He desired us to receive Him in <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to determine the Divine command more accurately and prescribe what the limits of time shall be for the reception of the sacrament. In the course of centuries the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> in this respect has undergone considerable change. Whereas the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were accustomed to receive at every celebration of the Liturgy, which probably was not celebrated daily in all places, or were in the habit of Communicating privately in their own homes every day of the week, a falling-off in the frequency of Communion is noticeable since the fourth century. Even in his time <a href="../cathen/05742d.htm">Pope Fabian</a> (236-250) made it <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> to approach the Holy Table three times a year, viz, at <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, and Pentecost, and this custom was still prevalent in the sixth century [cf. <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Synod of Agde</a> (506), c. xviii]. Although <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> left daily Communion to the free choice of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, his admonition, in force even at the present day, was: <em>Sic vive, ut quotidie possis sumere</em> (<a href="../fathers/15122.htm"><em>The Gift of Perseverance</em> 14</a>), i.e. "So live that you may receive every day." From the tenth to the thirteenth century, the practice of going to Communion more frequently during the year was rather rare among the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> and obtained only in <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloistered</a> communities. <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a> reluctantly allowed the <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> of his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to approach the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">Holy Table</a> weekly, whereas the rule of the Canons of <a href="../cathen/03729b.htm">Chrodegang</a> prescribed this practice. When the Fourth Council of Lateran (1215), held under <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, mitigated the former severity of the <a href="../cathen/09056a.htm">Church's law</a> to the extent that all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of both sexes were to communicate at least once a year and this during the paschal season, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<a href="../summa/4080.htm#article10">III:80:10</a>) ascribed this ordinance chiefly to the "reign of impiety and the growing cold of charity". The precept of the yearly paschal Communion was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> reiterated by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XIII, can. ix). The mystical <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, as <a href="../cathen/14465c.htm">Tauler</a>, St. Vincent Ferrer, <a href="../cathen/13490a.htm">Savonarola</a>, and later on St. Philip Neri, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Order</a>, <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a> and <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus Liguori</a> were <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> champions of <a href="../cathen/06278a.htm">frequent Communion</a>; whereas the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, under the leadership of <a href="../cathen/01742a.htm">Antoine* Arnauld</a> (De la fr&eacute;quente communion, Paris, 1643), strenuously opposed and demanded as a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> for every Communion the "most perfect penitential dispositions and the purest <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". This rigorism was condemned by <a href="../cathen/01295a.htm">Pope Alexander VIII</a> (7 Dec., 1690); the Council of Trent (Sess. XIII, cap. viii; Sess. XXII, cap. vi) and <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> (12 Feb., 1679) had already emphasized the permissibility of even daily Communion. To root out the last vestiges of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> rigorism, <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> issued a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> (24 Dec., 1905) wherein he allows and recommends daily Communion to the entire <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> and requires but two <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> for its permissibility, namely, the state of grace and a right and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. Concerning the non-requirement of the twofold species as a means <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> see <a href="../cathen/04175a.htm">COMMUNION UNDER BOTH KINDS</a>.
<h2 id="section5">The minister of the Eucharist</h2>

<p>The Eucharist being a permanent sacrament, and the confection (<em>confectio</em>) and the reception (<em>susceptio</em>) thereof being separated from each other by an interval of time, the minister may be and in fact is twofold: (a) the minister of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> and (b) the minister of administration.

<h3>The minister of consecration</h3>

<p>In the early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a> the Peputians, Collyridians, and <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a> attributed <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> powers even to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> (cf. Epiphanius, De h&aelig;r., xlix, 79); and in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a> and <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldenses</a> ascribed the power to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> to every <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> of upright disposition. Against these <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> the <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> (1215) confirmed the ancient <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a>, that "no one but the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> [<em>sacerdos</em>], regularly <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">keys</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, has the power of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> this sacrament". Rejecting the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> distinction between the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> later on declared, in accord with his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a "universal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>" (cf. <a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#vrs5">1 Peter 2:5</a>), that every <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> was qualified, as the appointed representative of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the Sacrament of the Eucharist. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> opposed this teaching of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, and not only confirmed anew the existence of a "special <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>" (Sess. XXIII, can. i), but authoritatively declared that "Christ <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and commanded them as well as other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to offer His Body and Blood in the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a>" (Sess. XXII, can. ii). By this decision it was also declared that the power of consecrating and that of <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> are identical. Both <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are mutually reciprocal. To the <a href="../cathen/03433a.htm">category</a> of "priests" (<em>sacerdos, iereus</em>) belong, according to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, only <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, and those in <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> are excluded from this dignity.

<p>Scripturally considered, the necessity of a special <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> with the power of validly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> is derived from the fact that Christ did not address the words, "Do this", to the whole mass of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, but exclusively to the Apostles and their <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">successors</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; hence the latter alone can validly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a>. It is evident that tradition has understood the mandate of Christ in this sense and in no other. We learn from the writings of <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a>, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, Augustine, and others, as well as from the most ancient Liturgies, that it was always the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and they alone, who appeared as the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> constituted celebrants of the Eucharistic Mysteries, and that the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> merely acted as assistants in these functions, while the faithful participated passively therein. When in the fourth century the abuse crept in of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> receiving <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> at the hands of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">First Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> (325) issued a strict prohibition to the effect, that "they who offer the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> shall not receive the Body of the Lord from the hands of those who have no such power of <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a>", because such a practice is contrary to "rule and custom". The <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the Luciferians was founded by an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> named Hilary, and possessed neither <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> nor priests; wherefore <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> concluded (Dial. adv. Lucifer., n. 21), that for want of celebrants they no longer retained the Eucharist. It is clear that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has always denied the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> the power to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> accused <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> (d. 373) of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>, because supposedly at his bidding the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">Chalice</a> had been destroyed during the Mass which was being celebrated by a certain Ischares, they had to withdraw their charges as wholly untenable when it was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that Ischares had been invalidly <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by a pseudo-bishop named Colluthos and, therefore, could neither validly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> nor offer the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>.

<h3>The minister of administration</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> interest which attaches to the minister of administration or distribution is not so great, for the reason that the Eucharist being a permanent sacrament, any communicant having the proper dispositions could receive it validly, whether he did so from the hand of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Hence, the question is concerned, not with the validity, but with the liceity of administration. In this matter the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to decide, and her regulations regarding the Communion <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> may vary according to the circumstances of the times. In general it is of Divine right, that the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> should as a rule receive only from the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> hand of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (cf. Trent, Sess. XIII, cap. viii). The practice of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> giving themselves <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> was formerly, and is today, allowed only in case of necessity. In ancient <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> times it was customary for the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to take the Blessed Sacrament to their homes and Communicate privately, a practice (<a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, Ad uxor., II, v), to which, even as late as the fourth century, <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> makes reference (<a href="../fathers/3202093.htm">Epistle 93</a>). Up to the ninth century, it was usual for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to place the <a href="../cathen/07489d.htm">Sacred Host</a> in the right hand of the recipient, who <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> it and then transferred it to his own mouth; <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, from the fourth century onward, were required in this <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> to have a cloth wrapped about their right hand. The <a href="../cathen/12372c.htm">Precious Blood</a> was in early times received directly from the Chalice, but in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the practice, after the eighth century, was to receive it through a small tube (<em>fistula</em>); at present this is observed only in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> Mass. The latter method of drinking the Chalice spread to other localities, in particular to the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, where the practice was partially continued into the eighteenth century.

<p>Whereas the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is both by Divine and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> the ordinary dispenser (<em>minister ordinarius</em>) of the sacrament, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> is by virtue of his order the extraordinary minister (<em>minister extraordinarius</em>), yet he may not administer the sacrament except ex delegatione, i.e. with the permission of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. As has already been mentioned above, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> were accustomed in the <a href="../cathen/07326a.htm">Early Church</a> to take the Blessed Sacrament to those who were absent from Divine service, as well as to present the Chalice to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> during the celebration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacred Mysteries</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, <a href="../fathers/050703.htm"><em>Treatise 3</em>, nos. 17 and 25</a>), and this practice was observed until <a href="../cathen/04175a.htm">Communion under both kinds</a> was discontinued. In <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas'</a> time (<a href="../summa/4082.htm#article3">III:82:3</a>), the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> were allowed to administer only the Chalice to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, and in case of necessity the <a href="../cathen/07489d.htm">Sacred Host</a> also, at the bidding of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. After the Communion of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> under the species of <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> had been abolished, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> powers were more and more restricted. According to a decision of the Sacred Congregation of Rites (25 Feb., 1777), still in force, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> is to administer <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> only in case of necessity and with the approval of his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or his <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. (Cf. <a href="../cathen/06322c.htm">Funk</a>, "Der Kommunionritus" in his "Kirchengeschichtl. Abhandlungen und Untersuchungen", <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, 1897, I, pp. 293 sqq.; see also "Theol. praktische Quartalschrift", <a href="../cathen/09273a.htm">Linz</a>, 1906, LIX, 95 sqq.)
<h2 id="section6">The recipient of the Eucharist</h2>

<p>The two <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of objective capacity (<em>capacitas, aptitudo</em>) and subjective worthiness (<em>dignitas</em>) must be carefully distinguished. Only the former is of dogmatic interest, while the latter is treated in <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">COMMUNION</a> and <a href="../cathen/04174a.htm">COMMUNION OF THE SICK</a>). The first requisite of aptitude or capacity is that the recipient be a "human being", since it was for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> only that Christ instituted this Eucharistic food of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and commanded its reception. This condition excludes not only irrational animals, but <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> also; for neither possess <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, which alone can be nourished by this food unto <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. The expression "Bread of Angels" (<a href="../bible/psa077.htm#vrs25">Psalm 77:25</a>) is a mere metaphor, which indicates that in the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">Beatific Vision</a> where He is not concealed under the sacramental veils, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> spiritually feast upon the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">God-man</a>, this same prospect being held out to those who shall <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> rise on the Last Day. The second requisite, the immediate <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduction</a> from the first, is that the recipient be still in the "state of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>" to the next life (<em>status viatoris</em>), since it is only in the present life that man can validly Communicate. Exaggerating the Eucharist's necessity as a means to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, <a href="../cathen/13194b.htm">Rosmini</a> advanced the untenable opinion that at the moment of death this <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a> food is supplied in the next world to children who had just departed this life, and that Christ could have given Himself in <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">Limbo</a>, in order to "render them apt for the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>". This evidently impossible view, together with other propositions of <a href="../cathen/13194b.htm">Rosmini</a>, was condemned by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> (14 Dec., 1887). In the fourth century the Synod of Hippo (393) forbade the practice of giving <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> to the dead as a gross abuse, and assigned as a reason, that "corpses were no longer capable of eating". Later <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, as those of <a href="../cathen/02145a.htm">Auxerre</a> (578) and the Trullan (692), took very energetic measures to put a stop to a custom so difficult to eradicate. The third requisite, finally, is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, without which no other sacrament can be validly received; for in its very concept <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is the "spiritual door" to the means of grace contained in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. A <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> or <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> might, indeed, materially receive the <a href="../cathen/07489d.htm">Sacred Host</a>, but there could be no question in this case of a sacramental reception, even though by a perfect <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> or of the pure <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> he had put himself in the state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. Hence in the Early Church the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> were strictly excluded from the Eucharist.
