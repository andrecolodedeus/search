<div id="springfield2">
<h1>The Bohemians of the United States</h1>  

<p>A traveler who has seen the natural beauties of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, its vast resources, and the thrift of its people, will, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, be surprised at the comparatively great number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of America</a>. The causes for this are political, religious, and economical.

<p>Religious dissensions at the beginning of the seventeenth century induced many to leave their native country and even to cross the ocean. The religious revolution stirred up by the preachings and teachings of <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">John Hus</a> gave birth to several <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, the suppression of which, after the battle of White Mountain near Prague (1620), caused many to <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrate</a> to other countries and several even as far as America. Of the latter Augustyn Herman (d. 1692) and Frederick Filip (d. 1702) are the most important from an historical standpoint. Herman must have been a man of good <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, for Governor Stuyvesant, of <a href="../cathen/11020a.htm">New Amsterdam</a>, entrusted him with many important missions. He made the first map of the <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">State of Maryland</a>, of which one copy is still preserved in the British Museum and another at <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>, in the archives of the <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">State of Virginia</a>. Herman always publicly professed his nationality. The second of these <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> emigrants, Filip, or Philipps as he is commonly known, was likewise a man of prominence and his descendants played no small part in the development of <a href="../cathen/11020a.htm">New Amsterdam</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the cemetery of Sleepy Hollow, near Tarrytown, New York. Though historical <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> is lacking, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> many other <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> of similar religious convictions, <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to this country at the same time. Their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> either died out, or, as more probable, were entirely assimilated by the American people so that they have left no trace.

<p>Of late years emigration from <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> has been chiefly caused by political conditions. Many <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> patriots, especially during the stormy year of 1848, sought refuge beyond the sea to evade the consequences of patriotic <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, as the courts showed little mercy to those accused of political crimes. A similar state of affairs existed later on when the reins of the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> Government passed into the hands of the enemies of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, who punished every patriotic act as high treason to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. These political conditions, coupled with the Austro-Prussian <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of 1866, in which <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> suffered great loss of life and <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, forced many to seek their fortunes in the land of freedom. The greater number of emigrants, however, came to this country on account of poverty, brought on, for the most part, by the failure of the Government to interest itself in the welfare of certain parts of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, especially the southern and eastern parts, where, for lack of industry, the people were forced to depend for their livelihood almost exclusively, on the fruits of the fields. This poverty was increased by overtaxation and frequent failures of crops. It was precisely these parts of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> that sent thousands of their best citizens to America about 1870, and are sending a still greater number at the present time.

<p>It will be impossible to give the exact number of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> immigrants to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, as the Immigration Bureau up to the year 1881 enrolled all immigrants that came from any province of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> as Austrians, and even after 1881, many <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> were listed as Austrians. As later immigration reports in which <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> were entered separately show that one-third of all immigrants from <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> come from <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, the total number of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> who came to this country before 1881 may be estimated approximately. It must be stated, however, that after 1881 many immigrants from <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a> and Silesia, Austrian provinces in which the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> language is spoken, were enrolled as <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a>. Taking all these facts into consideration, it is safe to give the number of foreign born <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> as 222,000. The number of American-born <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> is about 310,000, making the total <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> population of, the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> about 522,000. It is worthy of note that these figures are almost equally divided between males and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a>, which shows that the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> immigrants have come to this country to stay. Statistics prove that only a very small number of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> return to their native country to live. In 1906, 12,958 <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> immigrants were received, eclipsing the record of all previous years. The latest report of the Commissioner of Immigration shows only two percent of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> immigrants illiterate, as compared with four per cent of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> and still higher proportions for other nations.

<p>Of the larger cities <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> has a <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> population of about 100,000; New York, 40,000; <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>, 40,000; <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 8,500; <a href="../cathen/11249b.htm">Omaha</a>, 8,000; <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, 5,500; <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, 6,000; and St. Louis, 8,000.

<p>It is in the farming districts that the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> immigrants have attained the greatest degree of success. It is here that we can best see the great share they had in building up the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Coming for the most part from rural districts, accustomed to hard labor, and ever willing to undergo the hardships of pioneer life, the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> have attained an honorable place amongst the Western farmers. There is a saying amongst the Western farmers that if anyone can wrest crops from the soil, it is the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> farmer. About half of the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> immigrants have cast their lot with farming communities.
<h2>Societies</h2>

<p>Amongst the great number of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> in this country, there is no one organization uniting them into one national body. This may be explained by the fact that they are divided into two strongly antagonistic camps: <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheists</a> or <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">free-thinkers</a>. The latter are chiefly those who have <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of their fathers. Only an insignificant percentage of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> are adherents of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, though <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> have expended great labor and large sums in proselytizing amongst the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a>.

<p>The two camps are entirely separate, each with its own fraternal organizations. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have the following fraternal or benevolent organizations: The First <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> Roman <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Central Union (<em>Prvni Rimsko-Katolicka Ustredni Jednota</em>), founded in 1877 at St. Louis, has a membership of 11,505; the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Workman (<em>Katolicky Delnik</em>), founded in 1891, 3,225; the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> Roman <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Central Union of the <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">State of Wisconsin</a> (<em>Ceskd Rimsko-Katolicka Ustredni Jednota ve Statu <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a></em>) founded in 1888, 1,380; the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Union of the <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">State of Texas</a> (<em>Katolicka Jednota Texaska</em>), founded in 1889, 1,900; the Western <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Union (<em>Zapadni Cesko-Katolicka Jednota</em>), founded in 1898, 3,000; the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Union of <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a> (<em>Cesko-Rimsko-Katolicka Jednota ve Cleveland, O.</em>), founded in 1899, 1,800; the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Central Union of American Women (<em>Ustredni Jednota Zen Americkych</em>) established in 1880, 14,100; the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Union of Women of the <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">State of Texas</a> (<em>Ceska Rimsko-Katolicka Jednota Zen ve Statu <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a></em>) likewise a large membership. All these organizations are thoroughly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in spirit, and not only practice benevolence and charity towards their members, but have been the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in building <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and in fostering the spirit of religion amongst their countrymen.



<p>Opposed to these <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> organizations are the fraternal organizations of the <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">freethinking</a> <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a>. The strongest of these is the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> Benevolent Society (<em>Cesko-Slovanska Podporujici Spolecnost</em>), established at St. Louis in 1854, which has a membership, of about 15,000. This organization is chiefly responsible for the loss of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> amongst many <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> of this country, having enticed thousands of well-meaning people to join its ranks under the pretext of strict neutrality in religious matters. By association with <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">free-thinkers</a> and under other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> influences, thousands grew lukewarm in the performance of their religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and finally lost their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> entirely. This organization is <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheistic</a> in spirit and propagates <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheism</a> amongst its members. A similar tendency is exercised by the gymnastic or athletic <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> commonly called the Sokol (turners); by the Western Benevolent Society (<em>Zapdni Ceska Bratrska Jednota</em>), which has a membership of about 7,000; by the Society of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> Ladies (<em>Jednota Ceskych Dam</em>), with a membership of about 15,000, as well as several minor organizations of the same type.
<h2>Schools</h2>

<p>Wherever it is possible <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> endeavor to build a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Love of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of their native tongue impels them to send their children to these <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, it being the desire of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> that their children learn at least to read and write the language of their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. Experience shows that without such <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> children are soon estranged to the language and lose many of the good characteristics of their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. The number of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in this country is seventy-five, with a total attendance of about 14,000. There is also an institution of higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, St. Procopius College at Lisle, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, founded and conducted by the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>. The object of this institution is not only to train candidates for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, but to give young men in general such an <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> as to enable them to become leaders of their people in the various walks of life.
<h2>Press</h2>

<p>The first, and for a long time the only, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> newspaper published in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was the "Hlas" (Voice) of St. Louis, published semi-weekly. After its establishment in 1873 it was edited and managed for many years by its venerable founder, Monsignor Joseph Hessoun, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. John's Church, St. Louis, who gave it a special prestige among the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. In the year 1890 the "Pritel Ditek" (Friend of Children) was established in <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, a weekly periodical, and, as its name implies, intended chiefly for children. In the year 1892 the "Katol&iacute;k" (The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>) was founded, published twice a week, and by far the best periodical in the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> Language in this country. The "Katol&iacute;k" was followed by the daily "N&aacute;rod" (Nation) and the "Hospod&aacute;rsk&eacute; Listy (Agricultural News), established in 1898, appears twice a month. All of these papers are published by the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a> of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>. In addition, there are the following <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> papers: "Nov&yacute; Domov" (The New Home), a weekly publication of Hallettsville, <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>; the "Vlastenec" (Patriot) published weekly at <a href="../cathen/08735b.htm">La Crosse</a>, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>; the "Mesicni Vestnik," published by the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist Fathers</a> of New York once a month. All of these publications are doing inestimable service in the cause of religion.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">freethinking</a> press is no less powerful. Four <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> dailies are <em>ex professo</em> hostile to religion, while two others, though posing as neutral and independent papers, are in reality anti-religious in their sympathies and tendencies. Three <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> dailies are published in <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, two in New York, and two in <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>. There are in addition four biweeklies, ten weeklies, and several smaller publications.
<h2>Communities and Churches</h2>

<p>There are three <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The first and oldest, the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a> of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> was founded in 1887 by the <a href="../cathen/15648b.htm">Right Rev. Boniface Wimmer, O.S.B.</a>, first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Vincent's, Beatty, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. This apostolic man, perceiving the great dearth of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> among the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> invited <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> young men to his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> them free of charge, and fitted them for exercising the ministry amongst their own countrymen. At his request the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> granted permission for the establishment of an independent or canonical <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a>, in St. Procopius Priory of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, which in 1894 was raised by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">His Holiness Leo XIII</a> to the dignity of an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>; the Right Rev. John Nepomuk Jaeger, O.S.B., was elected the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Fathers</a> have charge of three <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> and two Slovak congregations, in the city of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, amongst them the congregation of St. Procopius, the largest <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> with a membership of about 10,000. They have likewise a large modern printing plant in which four leading <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> newspapers are printed. The order has 13 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 3 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, 3 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, and 10 lay-brothers. The second purely <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community is that of the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Sisters of the Sacred Heart at <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, established in 1894. These sisters are also in charge of St. Joseph's Orphanage at Lisle, Illinois. A second <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> is to be established at St. Louis, in connection with St. John's church, the oldest <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Sisters have at present 27 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, 7 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, and 1 candidate, and teach in several <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Besides these two exclusively <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities we have the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist Fathers</a> of New York and Baltimore, who do not, however, form independent communities, but are directly under the provincial who is at the head of all <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a> communities belonging to the Eastern province.

<p>The name of the Very Rev. Monsignor Joseph Hessoun (b. 1830; d. 4 July, 1906), late <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. John Nepomuk, St. Louis, is held in grateful remembrance by the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> people of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Born at Vrcovic, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, he came to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in 1865, eleven years after his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, and up to his death worked with untiring <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> among his people. The fruits of his labors were felt by <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> throughout the country. He not only encouraged them to perseverance by his editorials in the "Hlas," but he often sacrificed his last cent to assist in the building of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches. Furthermore, he did everything that lay in his power to procure <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for his people. Whenever necessity demanded he visited the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> without <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. In his old age he was universally called <em>nas taticek</em> (our little father). Among other <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who have labored with untiring <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> in this country must be mentioned the Very Rev. William Coka, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of <a href="../cathen/11249b.htm">Omaha</a>, b. at Cernovir, Moravia; d. 1902; the Rev. Father Sul&aacute;k, S.J., of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, the oldest <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> missionary; the Right Rev. John Nepomuk Jaeger, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a> of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>; the Rev. Wenceslaus Kocarnik, O.S.B., of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>; the Rev. John Vranek of <a href="../cathen/11249b.htm">Omaha</a>, a <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> poet of great ability and merit. Above all there is the noble pioneer of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> on the soil of the new world, the saintly John Nepomuk Neuman, fourth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Philadelphia, b. at Prachatitz, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, 1811; d. 1860.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> all over the world are renowned for their musical gifts. In <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> churches of this country <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a> has attained a high degree of excellence, especially noticeable by the congregational singing in the larger churches. Not a few <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are finished musicians. The feasts of the national patrons, those of St. John Nepomuk and of St. Wenceslaus, the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Prince of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, are celebrated with special pomp, according to the usages of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> is likewise observed with a solemnity unusual in this country. The <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of Our Lord</a> is celebrated with great pomp in the evening of <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>, wherever possible in the open air.
