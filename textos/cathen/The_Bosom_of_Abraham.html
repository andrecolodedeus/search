<h1>The Bosom of Abraham</h1>  

<p>In the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Bible</a>, the expression "the Bosom of Abraham" is found only in two verses of <a href="../bible/luk016.htm#vrs22">St. Luke's Gospel (16:22-23)</a>. It occurs in the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05048a.htm">Rich Man</a> and Lazarus the imagery of which is plainly drawn from the popular representations of the unseen world of the dead which were current in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> time. According to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> conceptions of that day, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the dead were gathered into a general tarrying-place the <em>Sheol</em> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> literature, and the <em>Hades</em> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> writings (cf. <a href="../bible/luk016.htm#vrs22">Luke 16:22</a>; in the Greek 16:23). A local discrimination, however, existed among them, according to their deeds during their mortal life. In the unseen world of the dead the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the righteous occupied an abode or compartment of their own which was distinctly separated by a wall or a chasm from the abode or compartment to which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the wicked were consigned. The latter was a place of torments usually spoken of as <em>Gehenna</em> (cf. <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs29">Matthew 5:29, 30</a>; <a href="../bible/mat018.htm#vrs9">18:9</a>; <a href="../bible/mar009.htm#vrs42">Mark 9:42 sqq.</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Latin Vulgate</a>) &#151; the other, a place of bliss and security known under the names of "Paradise" (cf. <a href="../bible/luk023.htm#vrs43">Luke 23:43</a>) and "the Bosom of Abraham" (<a href="../bible/luk016.htm#vrs22">Luke 16:22-23</a>). And it is in harmony with these Jewish conceptions that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> pictured the terrible <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> of the selfish Rich Man, and on the contrary, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> reward of the patient Lazarus. In the next life <a href="../cathen/05048a.htm">Dives</a> found himself in <em>Gehenna</em>, condemned to the most excruciating torments, whereas Lazarus was carried by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> into "the Bosom of Abraham", where the righteous dead shared in the repose and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">felicity</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> "the father of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>". But while <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commentators</a> generally agree upon the meaning of the figurative expression "the Bosom of Abraham", as designating the blissful abode of the righteous <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> after death, they are at variance with regard to the manner in which the phrase itself originated. Up to the time of <a href="../cathen/09567a.htm">Maldonatus</a> (A.D. 1583), its origin was traced back to the universal custom of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to take up into their arms, or place upon their knees, their children when they are fatigued, or return home, and to make them rest by their side during the night (cf. <a href="../bible/2sa012.htm#vrs2">2 Samuel 12:2</a>; <a href="../bible/1ki003.htm#vrs20">1 Kings 3:20</a>; <a href="../bible/1ki017.htm#vrs19">17:19</a>; <a href="../bible/luk011.htm#vrs7">Luke 11:7 sqq.</a>), thus causing them to enjoy rest and security in the bosom of a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> parent. After the same manner was <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> supposed to act towards his children after the fatigues and troubles of the present life, hence the metaphorical expression "to be in Abraham's Bosom" as meaning to be in repose and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> with him. But according to <a href="../cathen/09567a.htm">Maldonatus</a> (In Lucam, xvi, 22), whose theory has since been accepted by many scholars, the metaphor "to be in Abraham's Bosom" is derived from the custom of reclining on couches at table which prevailed among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> during and before the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. As at a feast each guest leaned on his left elbow so as to leave his right arm at liberty, and as two or more lay on the same couch, the head of one man was near the breast of the man who lay behind, and he was therefore said "to lie in the bosom" of the other. It was also considered by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of old a mark of special <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and favour for one to be allowed to lie in the bosom of the master of the feast (cf. <a href="../bible/joh013.htm#vrs23">John 13:23</a>). And it is by this illustration that they pictured the next world. They conceived of the reward of the righteous dead as a sharing in a banquet given by <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, "the father of the faithful" (cf. <a href="../bible/mat008.htm#vrs11">Matthew 8:11 sqq.</a>), and of the highest form of that reward as lying in "Abraham's Bosom". Since the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, "the Bosom of Abraham" gradually ceased to designate a place of imperfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and it has become synonymous with <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> itself. In their writings the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> mean by that expression sometimes the abode of the righteous dead before they were admitted to the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">Beatific Vision</a> after the death of the Saviour, sometimes <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, into which the just of the New Law are immediately introduced upon their demise. When in her <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> may carry the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of one of her departed children to "Abraham's Bosom", she employs the expression to designate <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> and its endless bliss in company with the faithful of both Testaments, and in particular with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the father of them all. This passage of the expression "the Bosom of Abraham" from an imperfect and limited sense to one higher and fuller is a most natural one, and is in full harmony with the general character of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> as a complement and fulfilment of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>.
