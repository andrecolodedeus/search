<h1>The Brethren of the Lord</h1>  

<p>A group of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> closely connected with the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> appears repeatedly in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> under the designation "his brethren" or "the brethren of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#vrs46">Matthew 12:46</a>, <a href="../bible/mat013.htm#vrs55">13:55</a>; <a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs31">Mark 3:31-32</a>, <a href="../bible/mar006.htm#vrs3">6:3</a>; <a href="../bible/luk008.htm#vrs19">Luke 8:19-20</a>; <a href="../bible/joh002.htm#vrs12">John 2:12</a>, <a href="../bible/joh007.htm#vrs3">7:3-5</a>; <a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs14">Acts 1:14</a>; <a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs5">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>). Four such "brethren" are mentioned by name in the parallel texts of <a href="../bible/mat013.htm#vrs55">Matthew 13:55</a> and <a href="../bible/mar006.htm#vrs3">Mark 6:3</a> (where "sisters" are also referred to), namely, <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a> (also mentioned <a href="../bible/gal001.htm#vrs19">Galatians 1:19</a>), Joseph, or Joses, Simon, and <a href="../cathen/08542b.htm">Jude</a>; the incidental manner in which these names are given, shows, however, that the list lays no claim to completeness.

<p>Two questions in connexion with these "brethren" of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> have long been, and are still now more than ever, the subject of controversy: (1) The identity of <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a>, <a href="../cathen/08542b.htm">Jude</a>, and Simon; (2) the exact nature of the relationship between the Saviour and his "brethren".
<h2 id="section1">The identity of James, Jude and Simon</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a> is without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../bible/act012.htm#vrs17">Acts 12:17</a>, <a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs13">15:13</a>, <a href="../bible/act021.htm#vrs18">21:18</a>; <a href="../bible/gal001.htm#vrs19">Galatians 1:19</a>; <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs9">2:9-12</a>) and the author of the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Epistle. His identity with <em>James the Less</em> (<a href="../bible/mar015.htm#vrs40">Mark 15:40</a>) and the <em>Apostle James, the son of Alpheus</em> (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs3">Matthew 10:3</a>; <a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs18">Mark 3:18</a>), although contested by many <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> critics, may also be considered as certain. There is no reasonable <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that in <a href="../bible/gal001.htm#vrs19">Galatians 1:19</a>: "But other of the apostles [besides Cephas] I saw none, saving <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a> the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a>", <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> represents <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a> as a member of the Apostolic college. The purpose for which the statement is made, makes it clear that the "apostles" is to be taken strictly to designate the Twelve, and its truthfulness demands that the clause "saving <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a>" be understood to mean, that in addition to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Cephas</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> saw another Apostle, "<a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a> the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a>" (cf. <a href="../bible/act009.htm#vrs27">Acts 9:27</a>). Besides, the prominence and authority of <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a> among the Apostles (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs13">Acts 15:13</a>; <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs9">Galatians 2:9</a>; in the latter text he is even named before <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Cephas</a>) could have belonged only to one of their number. Now there were only two Apostles named James: <a href="../cathen/08279b.htm">James the son of Zebedee</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James the son of Alpheus</a> (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs3">Matthew 10:3</a>; <a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs18">Mark 3:18</a>; <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#vrs16">Luke 6:16</a>; <a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs13">Acts 1:13</a>). The former is out of the question, since he was dead at the time of the events to which <a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs6">Acts 15:6 ssq.</a>, and <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs9">Galatians 2:9-12</a> refer (cf. <a href="../bible/act012.htm#vrs2">Acts 12:2</a>). James "the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a>" is therefore one with <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James the son of Alpheus</a>, and consequently with James the Less, the identity of these two being generally conceded. Again, on comparing <a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs25">John 19:25</a> with <a href="../bible/mat027.htm#vrs56">Matthew 27:56</a>, and <a href="../bible/mar015.htm#vrs40">Mark 15:40</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/mar015.htm#vrs47">Mark 15:47</a>; <a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs1">16:1</a>), we find that <a href="../cathen/09748b.htm">Mary of Cleophas</a>, or more correctly Clopas (<em>Klopas</em>), the sister of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary the Mother of Christ</a>, is the same as Mary the mother of <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James the Less</a> and of Joseph, or Joses. As married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are not distinguished by the addition of their father's name, <a href="../cathen/09748b.htm">Mary of Clopas</a> must be the wife of Clopas, and not his daughter, as has been maintained. Moreover, the names of her sons and the order in which they are given, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the order of seniority, warrant us in identifying these sons with <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a> and Joseph, or Joses, the "brethren" of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>. The existence among the early followers of Christ of two sets of brothers having the same names in the order of age, is not likely, and cannot be assumed without <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. Once this identity is conceded, the conclusion cannot well be avoided that Clopas and Alpheus are one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, even if the two names are quite distinct. It is, however, highly probable, and commonly admitted, that Clopas and Alpheus are merely different transcriptions of the same Aramaic word Halphai. <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a> and Joseph the "brethren" of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> are thus the sons of Alpheus.

<p>Of Joseph nothing further is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. <a href="../cathen/08542b.htm">Jude</a> is the writer of the last of the <a href="../cathen/03453a.htm">Catholic Epistles</a> (Jude 1). He is with good reason identified by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> commentators with the "Judas Jacobi" ("Jude the brother of James" in the <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay Version</a>) of Luke 6:16 and Acts 1:13, otherwise known as Thaddeus (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs3">Matthew 10:3</a>; <a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs18">Mark 3:18</a>). It is quite in accordance with Greek custom for a man to be distinguished by the addition of his brother's name instead of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a>, when the brother was better known. That such was the case with <a href="../cathen/08542b.htm">Jude</a> is inferred from the title "the brother of James", by which he designates himself in his Epistle. About Simon nothing certain can be stated. He is identified by most commentators with the Symeon, or Simon, who, according to <a href="../cathen/07194a.htm">Hegesippus</a>, was a son of Clopas, and succeeded <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Some identify him with the Apostle Simon the Cananean (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs4">Matthew 10:4</a>; <a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs18">Mark 3:18</a>) or the Zealot (<a href="../bible/luk006.htm#vrs15">Luke 6:15</a>; <a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs13">Acts 1:13</a>). The grouping together of <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a>, <a href="../cathen/08542b.htm">Jude</a> or Thaddeus, and Simon, after the other Apostles, <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas Iscariot</a> excepted, in the lists of the Apostles, (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs4">Matthew 10:4-5</a>; <a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs18">Mark 3:18</a>; <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#vrs16">Luke 6:16</a>; <a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs13">Acts 1:13</a>) lends some probability to this view, as it seems to indicate some sort of connexion between the three. Be this as it may, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that at least two of the "brethren" of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were among the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. This is clearly implied in <a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs5">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>: "Have we not the power to carry about a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, a sister, as well as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Cephas</a>?" The mention of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Cephas</a> at the end indicates that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, after speaking of the Apostles in general, calls special attention to the more prominent ones, the "brethren" of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> and <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Cephas</a>. The objection that no "brethren" of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> could have been members of the Apostolic college, because six months before <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's death</a> they did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him (<a href="../bible/joh007.htm#vrs3">John 7:3-5</a>), rests on a misunderstanding of the text. His "brethren" believed in his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> power, and urged him to manifest it to the world. Their unbelief was therefore relative. It was not a want of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in His <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiahship</a>, but a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> conception of it. They had not yet rid themselves of the Jewish <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiah</a> who would be a temporal ruler. We meet with this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> among the Apostles as late as the day of the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a> (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs6">Acts 1:6</a>). In any case the expression "his brethren" does not necessarily include each and every "brother", whenever it occurs. This last remark also sufficiently answers the difficulty in Acts 1:13-14, where, it is said, a clear distinction is made between the Apostles and the "brethren" of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.
<h2 id="section2">The exact nature of the relationship between the Saviour and his "brethren"</h2>

<p>The texts cited at the beginning of this article show beyond a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that there existed a real and near kinship between <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and His "brethren". But as "brethren" (or "brother") is applied to step-brothers as well as to brothers by blood, and in Scriptural, and <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> use generally, is often loosely extended to all near, or even distant, relatives (<a href="../bible/gen013.htm#vrs8">Genesis 13:8</a>, <a href="../bible/gen014.htm#vrs14">14:14-16</a>; <a href="../bible/lev010.htm#vrs4">Leviticus 10:4</a>; <a href="../bible/1ch015.htm#vrs5">1 Chronicles 15:5-10</a>, <a href="../bible/1ch023.htm#vrs21">23:21-22</a>), the word furnishes no certain indication of the exact nature of the relationship. Some ancient <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, like Helvidius and the <a href="../cathen/01562a.htm">Antidicomarianites</a>, maintained that the "brethren" of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> were His uterine brothers the sons of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> and <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>. This opinion has been revived in modern times, and is now adopted by most of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetes</a>. On the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> side two views have long been current. The majority of the Greek <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> and Greek writers, influenced, it seems, by the legendary tales of <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> gospels, considered the "brethren" of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> as sons of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">St. Joseph</a> by a first marriage. The Latins, on the contrary, with few exceptions (<a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">St. Hilary</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>), hold that they were the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord's</a> cousins. That they were not the sons of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> and <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the following reasons, leaving out of consideration the great antiquity of the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15448a.htm">perpetual virginity of Mary</a>. It is highly significant that throughout the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> appears as the Mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> alone. This is the more remarkable as she is repeatedly mentioned in connexion with her supposed sons, and, in some cases at least, it would have been quite natural to call them her sons (cf. <a href="../bible/mat012.htm#vrs46">Matthew 12:46</a>; <a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs31">Mark 3:31</a>; <a href="../bible/luk008.htm#vrs19">Luke 8:19</a>; <a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs14">Acts 1:14</a>). Again, <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary's</a> annual <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#vrs41">Luke 2:41</a>) is quite incredible, except on the supposition that she bore no other children besides <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. Is it likely that she could have made the journey regularly, at a time when the burden of child-bearing and the care of an increasing number of small children (she would be the mother of at least four other sons and of several daughters, cf <a href="../bible/mat013.htm#vrs56">Matthew 13:56</a>) would be pressing heavily upon her? A further <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> is the fact that at His death <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> recommended His mother to <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John</a>. Is not His solicitude for her in His dying hour a sign that she would be left with no one whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it would be to care for her? And why recommend her to an outsider if she had other sons? Since there was no estrangement between Him and His "brethren", or between them and <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, no plausible argument is confirmed by the words with which he recommends her: <em>ide ho uios sou</em>, with the article before <em>uios</em> (son); had there been others sons, <em>ide uios sou</em>, without the article, would have been the proper expression.

<p>The decisive <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, however, is that the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father and mother</a> of at least two of these "brethren" are known to us. <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a> and Joseph, or Joses, are, as we have seen, the sons of Alpheus, or Clopas, and of Mary, the sister of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary the Mother of Jesus</a>, and all agree that if these are not brothers of the Saviour, the others are not. This last argument disposes also of the theory that the "brethren" of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> were the sons of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">St. Joseph</a> by a former marriage. They are then neither the brothers nor the step-brothers of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>. <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a>, Joseph, and <a href="../cathen/08542b.htm">Jude</a> are undoubtedly His cousins. If Simon is the same as the Symeon of <a href="../cathen/07194a.htm">Hegesippus</a>, he also is a cousin, since this writer expressly states that he was the son of Clopas the uncle of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and the latter's cousin. But whether they were cousins on their father's or mother's side, whether cousins by blood or merely by marriage, cannot be determined with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>. <a href="../cathen/09748b.htm">Mary of Clopas</a> is indeed called the "sister" of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs25">John 19:25</a>), but it is uncertain whether "sister" here means a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sister or a sister-in-law. <a href="../cathen/07194a.htm">Hegesippus</a> calls Clopas the brother of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">St. Joseph</a>. This would favour the view that <a href="../cathen/09748b.htm">Mary of Clopas</a> was only the sister-in-law of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, unless it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, as stated in the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the Peshitta version, that <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> and Clopas married sisters. The relationship of the other "brethren" may have been more distant than that of the above named four.

<p>The chief objection against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> position is taken from Matt 1:25: "He [<a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>] <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> her not till she brought forth her <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> son"; and from Luke 2:7: "And she brought forth her <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> son". Hence, it is argued, <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> must have born other children. "Firstborn" (<em>prototokos</em>), however, does not necessarily connote that other children were born afterwards. This is evident from Luke 2:23, and Ex 13:2-12 (cf. Greek text) to which Luke refers. "Opening the womb" is there given as the equivalent of "firstborn" (<em>prototokos</em>). An only child was thus no less "firstborn" than the first of many. Neither do the words "he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> her not till she brought forth" imply, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> proves conclusively against Helvidius from parallel examples, that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> her afterwards. The meaning of both expressions becomes clear, if they are considered in connexion with the virginal birth related by the two <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>.
