<h1>The Calas Case</h1>  

<p>Jean Calas was a <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">French Calvinist</a>, born 19 March, 1698, at La Capar&egrave;de near Castres, in the department of Tarn; executed 10 March, 1762, at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. At the time of the events which made his name famous, he was a prominent merchant of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, where he had resided for some forty years. In 1731 he married Anne-Rose Cabibel, and had six children: four sons, Marc-Antoine, Louis, Pierre, and Donat, and two daughters, Rose and Anne. One of the sons, Louis, was converted to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> about 1760. His brother Marc-Antoine, also manifested an inclination to alter his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but, possibly owing to opposition on the part of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, never took the final step. On 13 October, 1761, a number of people, attracted by the excitement, gathered around the house of Jean Calas. Marc-Antoine had been found hanged in his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> warehouse. The news spread rapidly; the <em>capitouls</em>, or highest civil magistrates, hurried to the scene. One of the multitude cried out that Antoine* had been <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> to prevent him from <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjuring</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. The crowd immediately took up the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, and the members of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> were arrested. The dead son was looked upon as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, and his obsequies were celebrated with great <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. In the interrogatory the accused involved themselves in contradictions, and, on 9 March, 1762, the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, by a vote of 8 to 5, pronounced sentence against Jean Calas. He was condemned to the torture, ordinary and extraordinary, was then broken upon the wheel, and finally burnt. The sentence was executed the following day. Calas suffered with admirable <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and, until his last breath, never ceased to protest his innocence. The <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was confiscated. Madame Calas was liberated; but her two daughters, who were absent from home at the time of their brother's death, were forced into a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Visitation. Pierre and Donat escaped to Geneva. Voltaire, then living at Ferney, made the acquaintance of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and employed his all-powerful influence to have the dead father's innocence officially proclaimed, at the same time using the latter's condemnation as a welcome source of new attacks upon the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In letters and pamphlets he defended the cause of Calas, and interested his many powerful friends in the case, which now began to attract world-wide attention. On 9 March, 1765, a <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Parisian</a> tribunal unanimously pronounced Calas innocent. The Parliament of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> was ordered to revoke the death sentence, but never obeyed the injunction. The remnant of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was restored to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, which, by a subscription and by gifts of money from King Louis XV, was enabled to live in moderate circumstances. The Calas Case was not without its effect on contemporary art and literature. Over a hundred publications relating to it are in existence. It forms the subject of many plays by F.-L. Laya (produced for the first time in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1790), Lemierre d'Argy (Paris, 1790), Marie-Joseph Ch&eacute;nier (Paris, 1791), and Victor <a href="../cathen/05181b.htm">Du Cange</a> (Paris, 1819). Madame Calas and her daughters were living in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, when several of these were presented on the stage. Some historians, carried away perhaps by too great a desire to bring the innocence of Jean Calas to the fore, assert that Marc-Antoine committed <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a>. But there are weighty reasons to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the father's innocence (Barth&eacute;lemy). Voltaire cannot be considered an impartial historian of the case, owing to his preconceived desire to present a strong indictment against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, rather than to state the facts in their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light. The responsibility of the condemnation in no way rested with the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>, and the penalty was inflicted not for a mere religious offence, but for <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> alleged to have been committed for a religious motive.
