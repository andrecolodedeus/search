<h1>The Catholic Church Extension Society</h1>  

<h2>In the United States</h2>

<p>The first active agitation for a church extension or home mission <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in North America was begun in 1904 by an article of the present writer, published in the "American Ecclesiastical Review" (Philadelphia). This article was followed by a discussion in the same review, participated in by several <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and then by a second article of the writer's. On 18 October, 1905, the discussion which these articles aroused took form, and, under the leadership of the Most Reverend James Edward Quigley, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, a new <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, called The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Extension Society of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of America</a>, was organized at a meeting held in the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> residence at <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>. The following were present at that meeting and became the first board of governors of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>: <ul><li>The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> and Santa Fe, <li>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15616a.htm">Wichita</a>, <li>The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13105b.htm">Rockford</a>, <li>Reverends Francis C. Kelley, G.P. Jennings, E.P. Graham, E.A. Kelly, J.T. Roche, B.X. O'Reilly, F.J. Van Antwerp, F. A. O'Brien; <li>Messrs. M.A. Fanning, Anthony A. Hirst, William P. Breen, C.A. Plamondon, J.A. Roe, and S.A. Baldus.</ul>

<p>All these are still (1911) connected with the church extension movement, except Archbishop Bourgade of Santa F&eacute;, who has since died, Reverends E. P. Graham and E. A. O'Brien, and Mr. C. A. Plamondon, who for one reason or another have found it impossible to continue in the work. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> was made chairman of the board, the present writer was elected president, and Mr. William P. Breen, LL.D., of <a href="../cathen/06150a.htm">Fort Wayne</a>, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, treasurer. Temporary headquarters were established at Lapeer, Michigan. The second meeting was held in December of the same year, when the constitution was adopted and the work formally launched. A charter was granted on 25 December, 1905, by the <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">State of Michigan</a> to the new <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, whose objects were set forth as follows: "To develop the missionary spirit in the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. To assist in the erection of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> buildings for poor and needy places. To support <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for neglected or poverty-stricken districts. To send the comfort of religion to pioneer localities. In a word, to preserve the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> to thousands of scattered <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in every portion of our own land, especially in the country districts and among immigrants." In January, 1907, the headquarters of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> were moved to <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, and the president was transferred to that archdiocese. In April, 1906, the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> began the publication of a quarterly bulletin called "Extension". In May, 1907, this quarterly was enlarged and changed into a monthly; its circulation has steadily increased, and at the present time (1911) it has over one hundred thousand paid subscribers. On 7 June, 1907, the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> received its first <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> approval by an Apostolic Letter of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> addressed to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>. In this letter His Holiness gave unqualified praise to the young organization and bestowed on its supporters and members many spiritual favours. On 9 June, 1910, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> issued a special <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> by which the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was raised to the dignity of a <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a> directly under his own guidance and protection. By the terms of this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> is always to be chancellor of the Society. The president must be appointed by the Holy Father himself. His term of office is not more than five years. The board of governors has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to propose three names to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for this office, and to elect, according to their <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> all other officers of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> also provided for a cardinal protector, living in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His Holiness named Cardinal Sebastian Martinelli for this office, and later on appointed the present writer the first president under the new regulations. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> limits the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society's</a> activities to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and its possessions. A similar <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> was issued to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Extension Society in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>.

<p>Since the organization of the church extension movement, the American <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> has expended over half a million dollars in missionary work. It has made about seven hundred gifts and loans to poor missions, and has had about five hundred and fifty <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> built in places where no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> existed previously and the scattered people could attend Mass only with great difficulty. Both <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> have been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educating</a> many students for the missions, and both have circulated much good <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature. The American <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> operates a "chapel car" (donated by one of its members, Ambrose Petry, K. C. S. G.), which carries a missionary into the remote districts along railroad lines, preaching missions and encouraging scattered <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to form centres with their own little <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> as beginnings of future <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. The Holy Father has particularly blessed this <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> car work, and has given a gold medal to the donor of the car and to the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> in recognition of its usefulness. Another <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> car, much larger and better equipped, is now about to be built. The <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> has interested itself very greatly in the missionary work of <a href="../cathen/12291b.htm">Porto Rico</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a>, and has achieved substantial results. The <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> has been very active in saving the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> North-West to the Faith, against which an active <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> has been waged, especially by the <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterians</a>. It was principally through the publicity given to this activity by the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> Society that the situation was brought to the attention of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, who at the first Plenary Council decided to raise $100,000 for this work. The American <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society's</a> first quinquennial report shows splendid progress, and the present situation of both <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> gives promise of great things to come. A remarkable thing about the church extension movement is the ready response of the wealthier class of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> to its appeals. Some very large donations have been given. The Ancient Order of Hibernians is raising a fund of $50,000 for <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> building, and the Women's <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Order of Foresters $25,000. The directors intend to erect a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for the American mission.

<p>The church extension movement, as it exists in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, has no close parallels in other countries, but is not unlike the Boniface Association in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> or the &OElig;uvre of <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Membership is divided into founders ($5000), life members ($1000), fifteen-year members ($100), and Annual Members ($10). There is a Women's Auxiliary in both <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> which now begins to flourish. The American <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> has also a branch for children called the "Child Apostles". From the pennies of the children, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> are to be built and each one called the "Holy Innocents"; the children have just completed (1911) the amount needed for their first <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. The present officers of the American <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> are: <ul><li>His Eminence, Sebastian Cardinal Martinelli, Cardinal Protector; <li>Most Rev. James E. Quigley, D.D., Chancellor; <li>Most Rev. S. G. Messmer, D.D., Vice-Chancellor; <li>Very Rev. Francis C. Kelley, D.D., LL.D., President; <li>Rev. E. B. Ledvina, Vice-President and General Secretary; <li>Rev. E. L. Roe, Director of the Women's Auxiliary and Vice-President; <li>Rev. W. D. O'Brien, Director of the Child Apostles and Vice-President; <li>Mr. Leo Doyle, General Counsel and Vice-President; <li>Mr. John A. Lynch, Treasurer.</ul>

<p>The members of the executive committee are: <ul><li>Most Rev. James E. Quigley, D.D.; <li>Very Rev. Francis C. Kelley, D.D., LL.D., <li>Rev. Edward A. Kelly, LL.D.; <li>Messrs. Ambrose Petry, K. C. S. G., Richmond Dean, Warren A. Cartier, and Edward E. Carry.</ul>

<p>On the board of governors are the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, Santa F&eacute;, <a href="../cathen/11293a.htm">Oregon City</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/04462b.htm">Covington</a>, <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, <a href="../cathen/15616a.htm">Wichita</a>, Duluth , <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="../cathen/15037a.htm">Trenton</a>, <a href="../cathen/10410a.htm">Mobile</a>, <a href="../cathen/13105b.htm">Rockford</a>, <a href="../cathen/08602a.htm">Kansas City</a>, <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburgh</a> and Helena, and distinguished <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>.
<h2>In Canada</h2>

<p>The church extension movement was organized in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> as an independent <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> (bearing the name of "The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Extension Society of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>") by the <ul><li>Most Reverend Donatus Sbarretti, Delegate Apostolic of that country, <li>Most Rev. Fergus Patrick McEvay, D.D., <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a>, <li>Rev. Dr. A. E. Burke of the <a href="../cathen/03632a.htm">Diocese of Charlottetown</a>, <li>Very Rev. Monsignor A. A. Sinnott, secretary of the Apostolic Delegation, <li>the Rev. Dr. J. T. Kidd, chancellor of <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a>, <li>the Right Honourable Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, K. C. M. G., Chief Justice of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, <li>and the present writer.</ul>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> at once purchased the "Catholic Register", a weekly paper, enlarged it, and turned it into the official organ of the work. The circulation of this paper has increased marvellously. The new <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> received a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, similar to that granted the American <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, establishing it canonically. The same cardinal protector was appointed for both organizations. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a> was made chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, and Very Rev. Dr. A. E. Burke was appointed president for the full term of five years. The officers of the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> are: <ul><li>His Eminence Cardinal Martinelli, Protector; <li>The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a> (see vacant), Chancellor; <li>Very Rev. A. E. Burke, D.D., LL.D., President; <li>Rev. J. T.  Kidd, D.D., Secretary; <li>Rev. Hugh J. Canning, Diocesan Director; <li>The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a>; <li>Right Hon. Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, K. C. M. G., <li>and the President, Executive Committee.</ul>
