<h1>The Catholic University of America</h1>  

<p>A pontifical institution located in Washington, D.C. It comprises the Schools of the Sacred Sciences, Philosophy, Law, Letters, and Science, each of which includes several departments. Under the supreme authority of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, the governing power of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> resides in the episcopate of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, and by their delegation in the board of trustees, composed of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. The president of the board is the Chancellor of the University, and this office is held by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> <em>ex officio</em>. The immediate government of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> is entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> who is assisted by the academic senate. Instruction is given by professors, associate professors, and tutors. The number of these in 1907 was 32; the number of students (1906-1907) was 210. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> contains 100,000 volumes. The official organ of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> is "The Catholic University Bulletin" published quarterly 1895-1907, and since 1908 eight times yearly. Other official publications are the "General Announcements", the "Announcements" of the different Schools and the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector's</a> "Annual Report".

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>, October, 1866, the Bishops expressed their desire for the establishment of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. The project took definite shape in the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (1884) which included in its "Acta et Decreta" the decision to found a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and accepted Miss Mary Gwendoline Caldwell's offer of $300,000 to inaugurate the work. Washington was selected as the site, and the Right Rev. John J. Keane, then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>, was appointed <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a>, in 1887, sanctioned the undertaking and by the Apostolic Letter "Magni nobis gaudii" (7 March, 1889) approved the constitution and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, and empowered the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> to grant the usual degrees. The scope of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> as defined by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> was "to provide instruction in every department of learning to the end that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> alike might have an opportunity to satisfy fully their laudable desire for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>". The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> furthermore urged that the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, colleges, and other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutions of learning should be affiliated to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>; and he <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> that no step should be taken towards founding any other <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> without the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

Founders of fellowships were Miss Anna Hope Hudson, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and Rev. Thomas Brehony, Wilkesbarre, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>.

Thomas Carroll, Oil City, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>; The Mitchell Memorial Committee, Brooklyn; The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Young Men's National Union; the Right Rev. John J. Conroy, second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>, New York; Very Rev. Mgr. R.L. Burtsell, Rondout, New York; Miss Ruth C.

Lindesmith, Rootstown, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>; Rev.

T.M. Burke, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>, New York; Rev. P.J. Murphy, Oliphant, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>; the Right Rev. Mgr. D.W. Murphy, Dover, <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>; the Right Rev. Mgr. J.M. Mackey, Cincinnati.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> has also received donations and bequests from Albert F. Ryan, Norfolk, Virginia; Michael Cudahy, <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, Illinois; Miss Lina Caldwell, Newport, Rhode Island; Miss Rebecca Reyburn, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>; Miles P.

Leopold H&uuml;ffer and Sons, Paris, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; O. Andrews, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>; Miss Eliza P. Blight, Philadelphia, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>; Sylvester Johnson, <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, Kentucky; Rev. J. Lambert, Laconia, <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>; Gen. John Lawlor, Prairie du Chien, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>; John McCaffrey, <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>, New York; Miss M. Moran, Baltimore; M.

Numerous subscriptions were also made to the Divinity, University Chapel, and Guarantee Funds, as also to the Archbishop Kenrick Chair and the Archbishop Williams Chair.

<p>In 1896, Bishop Keane was succeeded in the rectorship by Rev. Thomas J. Conaty of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, who became (1903) <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10532a.htm">Los Angeles</a>. His successor was the Right Rev. Denis J. O'Connell, appointed (1907) <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13667a.htm">Sebaste</a>. His prudent administration and the generous response of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> people in the collection which <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> directed to be taken up annually in each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> enabled the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> to overcome the financial difficulties which it encountered in 1904.

<p>Since its foundation the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> has gradually become a centre of learning for the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. The institutions grouped about it, with the dates of establishment, are as follows: St. Thomas College (<a href="../cathen/10368c.htm">Paulist Fathers</a>), 1889; Marist College (Marists), 1891; Holy Cross College (Congregation of the Holy Cross), 1895; College of the Holy Land (Franciscans), 1897; St. Austin's College (Sulpicians), 1901; The Apostolic Mission House (Catholic Missionary Union), 1902; College of the Immaculate Conception (Dominicans), 1903. These colleges are the novitiates and houses of study of the several communities; their advanced students pursue courses in the University. Other affiliated institutions, outside the city of Washington, are the St. Paul Seminary, <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>, and the Institute of Scientific Study, New York. In compliance with the express desire of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> has contributed toward the improvement and co-ordination of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and has taken an active part in the organization and proceedings of the <a href="../cathen/05305a.htm">Catholic Educational Association</a> established for the purpose of unifying and furthering <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work. Though as yet but partially developed and inadequately endowed, it has exerted a salutary influence by encouraging research, maintaining a high standard of scholarship, and impressing upon the minds of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> throughout the country the need of providing <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> under <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> auspices.
