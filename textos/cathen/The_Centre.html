<h1>The Centre</h1>  

<p>(THE CENTRE PARTY).

<p>This name is given to a political party in the German Reichstag and to a number of parties in the diets of the various states of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. The oldest party which bears this name is that in the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Chamber of Deputies (<em>Abgeordnetenhaus</em>); the Centre Party of the German Reichstag was formed on 21 March, 1871. From the beginning both these parties have stood in close relation to each other, since both parliaments have their seats in <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> and a number of the members usually belong to both assemblies, and finally because, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> being the leading state of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, the leading statesmen of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> are also <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> and the governmental policies of both parliaments are in their fundamental principles the same. A predecessor of both parties is found in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Party in the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Chamber of Deputies, which in 1859 had adopted the name of the "Party of the Centre". In view of the hostile attitude of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government towards the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (the Raumer Decrees) this party was formed in 1852 for the defence of the freedom guaranteed in the Constitution and of the independence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Under the guidance of distinguished leaders (e.g. the brothers Reichensperger, <a href="../cathen/12723b.htm">August</a> and <a href="../cathen/12724a.htm">Peter</a>; <a href="../cathen/09571a.htm">Hermann von Mallinckrodt</a>; <a href="../cathen/08629c.htm">Bishop von Ketteler</a>. etc.), the party <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> of vast service to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause, but the denominational principle on which it rested was found too narrow and unsuitable for a parliamentary party in a constitutional state. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Party, which at its height never numbered more than fifty members, <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> dissolved, and after 1867 its last members allied themselves with others of the regular political parties.

<p>Meanwhile <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> had secured an outspoken parliamentary representation in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and other German states. As a counterpoise to the anti-Catholic <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> a new party was needed. The more immediate cause of the formation of the present Centre were the attacks on the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabite</a> (Berlin, 1869), the anti-Catholic measures proposed in the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Chamber of Deputies by the well-known professor of public law Gneist in connection with these attacks, and the fierce attacks made on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> which followed the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> and the declaration of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>. On 11 June, 1870, <a href="../cathen/12724a.htm">Peter Reichensperger</a> in the columns of the "K&ouml;lnische Volkszeitung" called upon <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to unite by drawing up a common programme for the elections then approaching. The cardinal point of this programme, <a href="../cathen/12724a.htm">Reichensperger</a> maintained, was the maintenance of the independence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the arrangement and administration of its affairs (especially with regard to the formation and development of religious associations), which was guaranteed by the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Constitution. A convention of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of the Rhine Provinces and <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> declared its entire adhesion to these proposals, but proposed that the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> should work simultaneously for the removal of social grievances and the promotion of all the interests of the labouring classes by sound <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> legislation. The <em>Soester Programm</em> of 28 October, 1870, sketched in clear and concise terms a comprehensive programme. On 13 December, 1870, the eve of the opening of the newly-elected <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Diet, at the suggestion of <a href="../cathen/12724a.htm">Peter Reichensperger</a>, Karl Friedrich von Savigny, and Friedrich von Kehler the Centre Party of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Chamber of Deputies was formed (<em>Zentrumsfraktion des preussischen Abgeordnetenhauses</em>); this was immediately joined by forty-eight members. On 21 March, 1871, sixty-three of the newly-elected members of the first German Reichstag united and formed the Centre Party of the German Reichstag (<em>Zentrumsfraktion des deutschen Reichstags</em>).

<p>The programmes of both Centres, which include men from every part of the empire and of the most different stations, are the same even today, more than forty years after the foundation of the parties. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of both parties are identical (except for unessential differences), and both reject enforced party allegiance, that is the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of the member to vote according to the direction of the party as a whole. "Justitia fundamentum regnorum" and "F&uuml;r Wahrheit, Recht, und Freiheit" (For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and liberty) are the mottoes which the Centre has always placed at the head of its programme. The programme declares the guiding-stars of its activity to be: (1) the preservation of the constitutional principle of the empire as a confederation of states, viz. unity only in essentials and in everything else the free decision by the individual states; (2) the promotion of the moral and material welfare of all classes of the population, the securing of constitutional guarantees for the civil and religious freedom of all subjects of the empire, and especially the defence of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of religious bodies against the attacks of the legislature.

<p>From the first the Centre has been accused by its adversaries (who did not become extinct with Bismarck) of furthering only religious and exclusively <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests and with being an exclusively <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and not a political party; consequently it was claimed that its existence was not justified in a state founded on the principle of parity; that even in non-ecclesiastical questions the Centre received instructions from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>, etc. The programme of the Centre, the adherence of a large number of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> members, and its parliamentary activity throughout the last forty years refute these accusations. In 1909, when various disputes broke out concerning the character of the party, its leaders again declared: "The Centre is essentially a political, non-denominational party; it takes its stand on the constitution of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, which requires of the deputies that they regard themselves as the representatives of the whole German people." True however to its programme, the Centre has regarded as its first and most urgent task the defeat of all legislative measures directed against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> section of the community; and, just as during the <a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a>, so also today the preservation of the civil equality of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> minority is considered the chief <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the party. Apart from its programme, the fact that almost all the deputies of the Centre and their electors belong to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> furnishes a sufficient guarantee that the party will most strenuously represent the interests of German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in every sphere of public life.



<p>Soon after its foundation the Centre was compelled by Chancellor Bismarck to engage in a long and difficult struggle for the liberty and independence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (see <a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">KULTURKAMPF</a>). By this heroic defence of the flouted <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, by its struggle for the restoration of religion as the principle of both public and private life in legislation and administration, by its devotion to constitutional liberty, and by its respect for its own <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of others, the party performed the most valuable services. The era of the open <a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a> passed. Bismarck was reasonable enough to lay aside a policy which he saw had been wrecked by the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> people. The year 1879 brought the great development of the <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> politics of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. The place of a <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> which refused co-operation was taken by the Centre, whose assistance had a decisive effect in initiating the new era of <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> development based on protection. With the influential co- operation of the Centre the financial basis of the empire was simultaneously laid. Early in the eighties the Empire devoted its attention to great social measures. With the eager and encouraging assistance of the same party the great German scheme of social insurance, the comprehensive law for the protection of labourers (1890), and later the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> for the protection of workmen were placed on the statute book. From 1895 to 1906 the Centre held the balance of power between the parties of the German Reichstag. During this period the uniform civil code for the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> was drawn up, the German colonial polity was guided into sounder channels, and foreign respect for the empire ensured by the creation of a strong fleet and by the development of military resources. Finally, a new law for the protection of home industries by the tariff was passed in 1902; the beneficial effect which this measured has exercised on agriculture, industry, and commerce is today beyond all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. Nevertheless, through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> especially have not ceased their accusations against the Centre and its supporters of want of patriotism, of treachery towards their native land, and of showing allegiance to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to the detriment of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. When the Centre refused to meet an unimportant demand of the Government connected with the German <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in South-West Africa, the Reichstag was dissolved (13 December, 1906), and a vindictive campaign against the Centre initiated. The adherents of the Centre did not waver in their allegiance to the party. The Liberal-Conservative Block, then formed and animated with hostility to the Centre, collapsed in 1909. With the help of the Centre the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> was then set on a sounder financial basis (Imperial Finance Reform of 1909). The great <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> of the united <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> and Social Democrats did little damage to the Centre in the elections of 1912. Although it does not possess quite its old strength, it is still powerful and feared and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by its adversaries. In 1912 it took a prominent part in the strengthening of the German army.

<p>Especially important in the history of the Centre are the years 1887 and 1892. In both years the German Government sought to influence the Centre in favour of new military <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> with the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. On both occasions, however, the Centre deprecated the intervention of the Vatican in purely political affairs, on the ground that its position would be prejudiced and that its adversaries (who are for the most part also the adversaries of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>) would seize the opportunity for reproaching the Centre with its dependence on foreign powers. In view of the peculiar nature of the German Constitution, the defence of the liberty and the legal position of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the task less of the Centre in the Reichstag than of the corresponding parties in the state diets, since religious and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> questions are, fundamentally considered, not within the competence of the empire. Not alone in the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Chamber of Deputies, however, but also in the German Reichstag, the Centre has always found it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to represent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests (even since the close of the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em>). Even during the last few years this was again the case, when the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> in union with the Evangelical League (<em>Evangelischer Bund</em>) and the adherents of Monism sought to make the measures of the Vatican (the <a href="../library/docs_pi10ed.htm">Borromeo Encyclical</a>, the Oath against Modernism, etc.) a pretext for a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and when a new secret <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> and against every positive view of life is gradually growing in strength. While the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> legislation in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, at least in so far as its most oppressive features are concerned, has been long repealed, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Law still remains in force, forbidding the members of this order (even though they are subjects of the empire) to settle in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. So far the Centre has been able to secure a mitigation of this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> (the removal of #2), but not its complete repeal. Vain have been its previous efforts to carry the so-called "Tolerance Law", which aims at securing full religious liberty for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in all the states of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. The Centre has to wage a constant <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> against the slighting of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in public life. Even today complete equality with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> fellow-citizens is withheld from <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. This is especially seen in the exclusion of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from the higher offices in the state, for only very rarely is a practical <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> entrusted with such an office, although more than one-third of the population of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Since the end of the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> an additional and most important task of the Centre Party in the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Chamber of Deputies has been the defence of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principles in public <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, while it has also had to fight constantly against the difficulties placed in the way of the foundation of religious institutions, etc.

<p>The chairmen of the Centre were: (a) in the Reichstag: Karl Friedrich von Savigny (1871-75); Freiherr von und zu Franckenstein (1875-90); Franz Graf von Ballestrem (1890-93); Alfred Graf von Hompesch (1893-1909); Freiherr von Hertling (1909-11); President of the High Court of Appeal, Dr. Spahn (1911-); (b) in the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Chamber of Deputies: Karl Friedrich von Savigny (1870-75); <a href="../cathen/13588b.htm">Freiherr von Schorlemer-Alst</a> (1875-89); <a href="../cathen/07190b.htm">Freiherr von Heeremann</a> (1889-1901); Sheriff (<em>Landrat</em>) Fritzen (1901-03); Councillor of Justice Dr. Porsch (1904-). The most celebrated leaders of the Centre were <a href="../cathen/15655a.htm">Dr. Ludwig Windthorst</a> and <a href="../cathen/09233b.htm">Dr. Ernst Maria Lieber</a>. From 1879 to 1912 &#151; with the exception of the Cartel and the Block periods (1887-90; 1907-09) &#151; the Centre was always represented in the presidency of the Reichstag. In the Reichstag elected in 1912 the Centre renounced its claim to a presidential position on account of the alliance between the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> and Socialists. In 1879-87 the Centre secured the appointment of Freiherr von Franckenstein as first vice-president; in 1890-93 of Count Ballestrem; in 1893-95 of Freiherr von Buol-Berenberg. When in 1895 the Conservative president resigned because the majority of the Reichstag refused to vote for the official congratulation of Prince Bismarck on the occasion of his eightieth birthday, a member of the Centre (Freiherr von Buol-Berenberg) for the first time occupied the presidential chair. This <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> remained with the Centre until the dissolution of the Reichstag in 1906, and the exceptional skill with which Count Bellestrem conducted the business of the Reichstag was universally recognized. In 1910-11 the leader of the Centre, Dr. Spahn, was first vice-president. In the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Chamber of Deputies the Centre has appointed the first vice-presidents since 1882; since 1903 Dr. Porsch has filled this position. An "Imperial Committee of the German Centre Party" (15 members), to deal with all the interests of the party throughout the empire, was founded in 1911. Previous to that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> there were only the still existing national committees for the different states. In important affairs representatives of the other states of the confederacy are invited to the sessions of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> national committee. Of the 397 members of the German Reichstag, the Centre claimed 63 in 1871; 93 in 1877; 94 in 1878; 100 in 1881; 99 in 1884; 98 in 1887; 106 in 1890; 96 in 1893; 102 in 1898; 100 in 1903; 109 in 1907; 92 in 1912. Of the 433 (since 1906, 443) members of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Chamber of Deputies the Centre numbered 54 in 1870, 86 in 1873, and since that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> always over 90 (since 1909, 104).
<h2 id="section1">Bavaria</h2>

<p>In 1869 the "Bavarian Patriotic Party" was founded in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. It was called into existence by the strong opposition to the surrender of the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> claims to the sovereignty in favour of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> (i.e. of the North German Confederacy), and also for the purpose of opposing the anti-religious policy of <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a>, which found expression especially in the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> School Bill of 1868. The first leader of the Patriotic Party was Dr. Edmund J&ouml;rg (1819-1901), who performed such valuable service during his long occupancy of the editorial chair (1853-1901) of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> periodical "Historisch-politische Blatter." Through their affection for and sympathy with neighbouring <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, whose people were descended from the same stock and were kindred in their <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, and through their dislike and suspicion of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, which was little friendly towards <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, J&ouml;rg and a section of the Patriotic Party opposed the union of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> under the leadership of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> in 1870-71. They voted against the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> appropriation moved by the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Government on the outbreak of the Franco- German War, supported only the armed neutrality of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and voted against the Treaty of Versailles. The Patriotic Party, however, later acquiesced in the reorganization of the relations of the German states, and did not refuse its consent to the extension of the competence of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>.

<p>From 1871 to 1875 the party waged a vigorous <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> against the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Government in view of the anti-Catholic legislation introduced after the <a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Prussian model</a> and of its extensive support of the Old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> movement. Even in 1875, when the party had the majority in the Chamber, the Government continued the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> (Minister of Public Worship von Lutz), although now in an underhand manner. Only since 1890 have the <a href="../cathen/11235a.htm">Old Catholics</a> no longer been officially considered as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and in that year was passed the vote for the recall of the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist Fathers</a> (expelled in 1872). The attempt of Dr. Johann Sigl (editor of the extravagantly particularistic daily paper "Das bayrische Vaterland") to found a "Catholic Popular Party" in 1876, because in the minds of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> the Patriotic Party had not been sufficiently energetic in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> questions, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> unsuccessful. In 1887 the Patriotic Party adopted the name of the "Bavarian Centre Party". In 1890, owing to the growth of the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Peasants' League, the party lost its majority in the diet. The quarrel between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> having ceased, the Centre inserted in its programme a systematic policy in favour of agriculture and small industries (1893), and in the elections of 1899 again secured a majority. This they still (1912) retain in spite of the attacks of the united Liberal and Social Democratic parties. During this period the Party took the lead in the constitutional development of the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> legislation and administration as regards both <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and economics. In 1912 a member of the Centre was for the first time appointed president of the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Ministry (Freiherr von Hertling). The most celebrated leaders of the party, after the retirement of J&ouml;rg, were: Councillor of the High Court of Appeal Geiger (1833-1912) and Dr. von Daller, gymnasial <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> and professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> (1835-1911). The most prominent leaders of today (1912) are Dr. von Orterer (b. 1849), gymnasial <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> and councillor for higher studies, Dr. Pichler (b. 1852), <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a>, and Dr. Heim (b. 1865), leader of the Peasants. The leader of the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Centre in the German Reichstag is Dr. Schadler (b. 1852), <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> dean of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>. Of the 159 (since 1905, 163) members of the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Chamber the Patriotic Party (i.e. the Centre) claimed 80 in 1869; 79 in 1875; 68 (83) in 1881; 79 in 1887; 74 in 1893; 84 in 1889; 102 in 1905; 98 in 1907; and 87 in 1912.
<h2 id="section2">W&uuml;rtemberg</h2>

<p>The Centre Party of Wurtemberg was founded on 11 July, 1894, to contest the diet elections of 1895. In 1895 and 1900 the Centre secured 20 deputies; in 1906 they numbered 25 deputies (out of a total of 92 deputies). Before 1894 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> deputies had been allied either with the regular "National Party" or with the so-called "Left". An alliance of all the deputies who defended the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and liberties of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was less <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> during the seventies and eighties in Wurtemberg than in other German states, since Wurtemberg was spared a <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em>, thanks to the good sense of the Government and the benevolence of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> king. It was only in the last decades that denominational differences began to play a more prominent part in public life. The first leader of the Wurtemberg Centre and of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Wurtemberg was Rudolf Probst (1817-99), Director of the Life Insurance Bank; the most prominent leaders of the present day (1912) are Adolf Grober, Provincial Court Director, Johann von Kiene, President of the Senate in the High Court of Appeal, and the brothers Alfred and Viktor Rembold (both barristers). The Centre of the German Reichstag received one deputy from Wurtemberg in 1871; since 1880 it has received always four deputies as members.
<h2 id="section3">Baden</h2>

<p>A fierce <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between State and Church broke out in Baden in the early sixties. Although two-thirds of the population of <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a> were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, the Diet of Baden contained no champions of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, partly owing to the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> state of the franchise and partly because the majority of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, influenced by the anti-Roman <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> <a href="../cathen/15590b.htm">Ignaz von Wessenberg</a>, inclined towards Liberal <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and a national Church. The anti- religious attitude of the Government and of the Liberal Party, however, gradually awakened the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. In 1867 the "Catholic Popular Party" was formed, its first, and for some time its only, representative being the merchant Jacob Lindau (1833-98). In 1869, however, four <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> deputies were elected. Although originally the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Popular Party favoured union with <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, it expressed in 1870-71 its entire adhesion to the treaties which laid the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. The deputies elected in Baden on the programme of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Popular Party for the German Reichstag joined the German Centre Party as early as 1871. In the seventies, while the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> raged in <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a>, the Party defended with great boldness, and not without some success, in the Diet of Baden the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 1881, when the party had twenty-three mandates, it adopted a new constitution, and recognized in their entirety the principles of the Centre Party of the German Reichstag as its own. In the middle of the eighties a serious crisis within the party was occasioned by the question whether the policy of the party was to be friendly to the Government or strictly defensive of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests. The number of deputies of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Popular Party fell from 23 to 9. In 1888 the party was reorganized under the name of the <em>Badische Zentrumspartei</em> (Centre Party of Baden). To terminate the swamping of the political life of <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a> by the anti-religious policy of the National <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> was declared to be its most important task. Since then the party has been almost unceasingly gaining ground, and has performed notable services in furthering the welfare of the country and in defending the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It is bitterly opposed by the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> and Social Democrats, who have been united in the <em>Grossblock</em> (Great Block) since 1905. Of the 73 members of the Chamber the party claimed 28 in 1905 and 26 in 1909. The reorganizer and able leader of the Centre of Baden is Theodor Wacker, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Z&auml;hringen. He is assisted by Konstantin Fehrenbach, a barrister, and Johann Zehnter, President of the National Court.
<h2 id="section4">Alsace-Lorraine</h2>

<p>The Centre Party of Alsace-Lorraine was formed in 1906 from the "Catholic National Party", which had in turn been formed in 1903 from the "Elsasser" and the "Lothringer" (the "Alsatians" and the "Lorrainians"). Although the Centre of Alsace-Lorraine joined the Centre in the Reichstag, various causes prevented a complete understanding being arrived at, especially because the Centre Party in the Reichstag was opposed to the particularistic and separationist ideals of a portion of the Centre of Alsace-Lorraine. The leader of the separationist division is Abb&eacute; Wetterl&eacute;. As the Centre in the Reichstag accepted the new Constitution for Alsace-Lorraine in a form unacceptable to the Centre of these states, all relations between these two bodies were broken off. Since 1912, however, attempts have been made to re- establish unity. The chairman of the Centre of Alsace-Lorraine is Karl Hauss, editor-in-chief of the "Els&auml;sser Boten" (a daily paper). In the Diet of Alsace-Lorraine the Party had 27 deputies in 1911 (out of a total of 60); in the German Reichstag it numbered 7 out of the 397 members in 1912.
<h2 id="section5">Hesse</h2>

<p>A Catholic Popular Party was formed in the Grand Duchy of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a> as early as the forties. Shortly after the formation of the Centre in the Reichstag, this party also took the name "Centre". While the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> raged in <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a> during the seventies, the party energetically championed the interests of the oppressed <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In 1911 the party claimed 9 deputies out of a total of 50. Its leader is the counsel, Dr. Schmitt-Mainz. The Grand Duchy sends 9 deputies to the German Reichstag, but none of these belongs to the Centre Party.
<h2 id="section6">Oldenburg</h2>

<p>Until 1910 there was no organized Centre Party in the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who constitute about one-fifth of the population of <a href="../cathen/11237b.htm">Oldenburg</a>, live to the south in the district known as the M&uuml;nsterland, which until 1803 was under the rule of the Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>. Since the introduction of the Constitution this <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> section has chosen representatives of its own religion &#151; at first 6, but later, with the increase of the population, 8. From the beginning these representatives have stood for the principles of the Centre in the German Reichstag, and championed the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> outlook in public life. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> deputies have performed a specially useful service in recent years by their firm advocacy of a movement to introduce new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> based on a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and denominational foundation, for the three divisions of <a href="../cathen/11237b.htm">Oldenburg</a>. Until recently party politics did not play any prominent part in the Diet of Oldenburg, as such tactics did not appeal to even the non-Catholic deputies. Since about 1870 the Government has showed a benevolent attitude towards the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>, and the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> obtained no footing in <a href="../cathen/11237b.htm">Oldenburg</a>. The need of a definite party organization first arose when the Social Democrats captured some seats in the diet, and the direct franchise was introduced in 1909. The organization of the Centre was therefore adopted in 1910, and on this programme 9 deputies (out of a total of 45) were elected in 1911. The able leader of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> deputies of <a href="../cathen/11237b.htm">Oldenburg</a> and of the Centre is Dr. Franz Driver, counsel to the administrative high court. The grand duchy sends three deputies to the Reichstag; one of these, elected by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> south, has been from the first a member of the Centre in the Reichstag.
<h2 id="section7">Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach</h2>

<p>Among the twenty-three deputies elected to the Diet of this grand duchy the Centre has one deputy, elected by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> section of the Oberland in Eisenach.

<p>(h) The other diets of the German federal states have no Centre deputies, inasmuch as the states are almost entirely <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. In the Kingdom of Saxony, however, there is a well-organized Centre Party which devotes attention to the elections to the Reichstag and the national Diet. Owing to the relatively small number of its adherents in this almost purely <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> state (95% <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>), the party cannot secure the election of any candidate of its own; still the votes of its members in individual constituencies are decisive in the case of second ballots.

<p>In very recent times (since about 1910) alliances between the councillors of various municipalities and towns, who have been elected on the Centre programme (or who favour that programme), have developed or been formed immediately into "Communal Centre Parties". Almost everywhere in the cities and larger communities of the German federal states and provinces a great prejudice against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> section of the community may be noticed. Apart from the inaction of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, the cause of this <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> may be traced to the plutocratic franchise, which almost everywhere places great power in the hands of the few wealthy people, who for the most part hold Liberal views. As the communal franchise gradually becomes more democratic, however, the representation of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who take their stand on the Centre programme also increases. This increase is indeed accompanied by a growth in the number of Social Democrats, with whom the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> in very frequent instances ally themselves in opposition to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and the Centre. For the introduction of the principles of the Centre Party into communal administration, the formation of the communal representatives who favour the Centre into Communal Centre parties has been effected. Regular unions of the Centre members of the communal bodies in the larger areas (counties, provinces, states) have also been formed in many places, e.g. in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, the Rhine Provinces, <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, and Upper Silesia; these unions bear the name of "Communal Conferences of the Centre". In <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> attempts have also been made to elect adherents of the Centre to county and provincial diets to counteract the decisive influence of the higher state officials, whose views are mostly National Liberal or Free Conservative.
