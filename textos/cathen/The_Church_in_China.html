<h1>The Church in China</h1>  

<h3>Ancient Christians</h3>

<p>The introduction of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> into <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> has been ascribed not only to the Apostle of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, St. Thomas, but also to St. Bartholomew. In the third century, Arnobius, in "Adversus Gentes", speaks of the <em>Seres</em>, with the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> and the Medes, as among the nations reached by "that new power which has arisen from the works done by the Lord and his Apostles". Though there is evidence that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> existed in Mesopotamia and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> during the fourth century, as evidenced by the persecutions which began in 345 under Sapor (309-379), there is no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that it spread to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. After the condemnation of Nestorius, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, at the Council of Ephesus (431) and his banishment, his disciples spread his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> through <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. They seemed to have reached <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> in the seventh century, according to the Si-ngan-fu inscription. In should be added that, according to Ebedjesus, some thought that Arch&aelig;us, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Selucia, had created a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> in 411, while others said that the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> dated only from Saliba Zacha, patriarch of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> from 714 to 728. According to Pauthier, the T'ang Emperor, Hiuan T'sung issued in 745 an edict wherein it was stated that the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> of the religion from Ta Ta'in being known popularly as Persian <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>, it was ordered that, this being inaccurate, thenceforth the latter name should be changed to Ta Ts'in <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>.
<h3>Si-ngan-fu inscription</h3>

<p>In the year 1625 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in Peking were informed that a slab referring to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> had been found not long before, possibly in 1623, at Ch'ang-ngan (Si-ngan-fu). Father Nicolas Trigault was sent to inspect the stone, which had been discovered at Cheu-che, some distance from Ch'ang-ngan. It was one of the monuments called by the Chinese antiquaries <em>pei</em>. The French traveller, Grenard, who visited Si-ngan-fu a few years ago gives the following measurements: height, 7 ft., 9 ins., width 2 ft. 9 ins., thickness 10 ins. At the top a cross is incised, under which nine large characters in three columns for the heading, which reads as follows: Monument commemorating the introduction and propagation of the noble law of Ta T'sin in the Middle Kingdom. According to the text of the inscription, Olopen arrived from Ta T'sin at Ch'ang-ngan in the ninth year of the period Chang-kwan (635); Emperor T'ai Tsung sent his minster, Duke Fang Huan-ling, to receive him and conduct him to the palace; the Scriptures were translated, and the Emperor, becoming convinced of the correctness and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of Olopen's religion, gave special orders for its propagation, and in the seventh month of the twelfth year of Chang-kwan (638), in the autumn, issued a proclamation: a Ta T'sin <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was built, etc. The conclusion of the inscription runs as follows: Erected in the second year of the period Kien-chung (781) of the great T'ang dynasty, the year star being in Tso-yo, on the seventh day of the first month, being Sunday. The inscription consists of 1780 characters; in addition to the Chinese characters, at the foot and on the sides, the stele also exhibits a series of data in the Syriac language, in Estrangelo characters. Sir Henry Yule (Marco Polo, II, 27) thinks that Olopen is only a Chinese form of <em>rabban</em>, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, while Prof. Hirth makes Olopen stand for <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a>, or Rupen. It appears from a paper by J. Takakusu (Ts'ung-pao, VII, 589-591) that Adam (<em>King-tsing</em>) who erected the monument under Te-tsung, under the same emperor, translated, with a <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> S&ucirc;tr&ccedil;, the "Satp&acirc;ramit&acirc;", from a Hu text.

<p>The question of the authenticity of the inscription has been formerly often raised, but today no one can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the genuineness of this most important document for the history of the propagation of the Faith in the Far East; we fully agree with A. Wylie, who writes: If the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> tablet can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>, there are few existing memorials of bygone dynasties which can withstand the same type of arguments. This inscription is generally considered as emanating from <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>; but this is supported only by circumstantial evidence, for it must be remarked that nothing in it is characteristic of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>.
<h3>Nestorians</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> were successful in converting the Keraits to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> at the beginning of the eleventh century, as related by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> historian, <a href="../cathen/02294a.htm">Bar Hebr&aelig;us</a>. The Keraits remained <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> till the time of Jenghiz Khan, as is attested by Rashiduddin; Their head is spoken of by Rubruck and <a href="../cathen/12217a.htm">Marco Polo</a> as Ung Khan (Wang Khan), identified with <a href="../cathen/12400b.htm">Prester John</a>; when Wang Khan was defeated by Jenghiz, his niece, Sorhabyani, married Tuli, the fourth son of the conqueror, and became the mother of Kublai. When Kublai removed his capital to Peking, he founded in 1280 the chief <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> consistory, under the name of <em>Ch'ung-fu-tze</em>; the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> were known as <em>Erkeun</em> (Ye-li Ko-wen). but this term was later applied to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in general, who were called by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> <em>Tersa</em> (transcribed <em>Tie-sie</em>). The last name, however, disappeared with the removal of the capital to Peking. Mar Sergius, a <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are mentioned in a description of Chin-kiang-fu. The <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> had a number of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> throughout <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and two archbishoprics, one at Cambalue (Peking), one at Tangut (Tanchet); there is even a record of a <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a>, Mar Jabalaha (b. 1245), a pupil of another <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a>, Rabban Sauma (b. in Peking), being appointed <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> when Denha died, though he was unacquainted with the Syriac tongue. This is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the influence of the Mongols of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a>, however, prevailed at court, and two of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> churches were converted to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>. The prosperity of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> continued through the Mongol period. We may judge their numbers and influence by the fact that friar Oderic, about 1324, found three <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> churches in the city of Yang-chou, but soon afterwards they fell into decay. Evidence of their existence was found by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at the beginning of the seventeenth century.


<h3>Medieval Catholic missions</h3>

<p>The great religious <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries dates from the Council of Lyons held in 1245 by <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Pope Innocent IV</a>. The interests of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> were threatened by the Mongolian conquest, and it became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to send ambassadors to the Tatar chief to find out his intentions. Two <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, who had been instituted at the beginning of the thirteenth century, were ready to furnish the agents for the mission. John of Plano Carpini, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, accompanied by Friar Stephen of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, left Lyons on 16 April, 1245, and was joined at <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a> by Friar Benedict, a <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Pole</a>. They went by way of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> and Kieff, and in February, 1246, reached the camp of Batu, grandson of Jenghiz, on the Volga; thence they went to Karakorum to the to the court of Kuyuk Khan. On 13 November they began their return voyage with the Mongol chief's reply to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> letter and reached <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> in 1247. As a reward, Carpini was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01582b.htm">Antivari</a>. Four <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, Anselm of <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, Simon of Saint-Quentin, Alberic, and Alexander, joined at Toflis by <a href="../cathen/01474a.htm">Andrew of Longjumeau</a> and Guichard of <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, were sent on a mission to the Mongol general, Ba&iuml;ju, in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, but were received badly, and dismissed on 25 July, 1245, with a haughty letter for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. St. Louis, King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, sent the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, <a href="../cathen/13217a.htm">William of Rubruck</a> (known as Rubruquis), to the court of Mangu Khan, successor of Kuyuk; he returned to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Acre (1255), were he wrote an account of his voyage. Speaking of Carpini and Rubruck, Yule says (Cathay, I, p. CXXIII): These were the first, so far as I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, to bring to western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> the revived <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a great and civilized nation lying in the extreme east upon the shores of the ocean. To this kingdom they gave the name, now first heard in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, of Cathay. Though the first missionaries went sent to the court of Kublai by <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a> (1277-80), the real founder of the mission of Cambalue was <a href="../cathen/08474a.htm">John of Montecorvino</a>, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friar</a> (b. at <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a>, 1247), sent by <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a>. Giovanni probably reached the Mongol capital before the death of the Great Khan. In 1307 <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> sent seven <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> having the rank of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who were to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> Montecorvino as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Cambalue and <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of the Far East; only Andrew of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, Gerard, and Peregrinus reached <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> in 1308 and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Montecorvino; a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> was erected at Zaitun in Fu-kien, which was occupied in turn by Gerard (d. 1313), Peregrinus (d. 1322), and Andrew of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>; Montecorvino died in 1333 and was succeeded by Nicholas, a <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, who arrived in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> with twenty-six <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> and six <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>. A mission was also created at Ili-baluc in Central <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> with Richard of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> as its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but it was destroyed. In 1362 the fifth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Zaitun, James of Florence, was massacred. In 1370, William of <a href="../cathen/12117a.htm">Prato</a>, professor of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, was appointed to the See of Peking. An <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">apostolic legate</a>, Francisco di Podio, with twelve companions, was sent out in 1371, but they were never heard from; all the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missions disappeared in the turmoil which followed the fall of the Mongols and the accession of the Ming dynasty (1368).
<h3>Modern missions</h3>

<p>If the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friar</a>, Gaspar da Cruz, was actually the first modern missionary to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, where, however, he stayed but a short time, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> under <a href="../cathen/13034a.htm">Matteo Ricci</a> were the first to give a solid basis to the missions in the Celestial Empire. They spread through the Kwang-tung province to the central provinces, Nan-king, Shanghai, Hang-chou, endeavoring to reach Peking. In 1602 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, Benedict de Go&aelig;s, started from <a href="../cathen/01225a.htm">Agra</a> in an attempt to reach Peking by land. He arrived at the frontier town of Su-chou, where he died, 18 March, 1606, from the fatigue of his long journey. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> soon found eager competitors in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, who arrived in 1633, but where expelled from <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> four years later.

<p>In August, 1635, Li, Prefect of Kiang-chou, issued a proclamation which was in reality an apology for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, praising Kao (Father Alfonso Vagnoni, b. in the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, 1566; d. at Kiang-chou, 19 April, 1640). In July, 1641, Tsuo, Sub-prefect of Kien-ning-hien in Fu-kien mentions Aleni as a master eminent among the learned men of the West, and speaks in high terms of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. The conquest of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> by the Manchus (1644) was a cause of great suffering to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The celebrated <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, <a href="../cathen/13520a.htm">Johann Adam Schall von Bell</a>, head of the Board of Mathematics, was thrown into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, but he soon regained favor under the first Manchu emperor, Shun-che. In 1664, during the minority of K'ang-hi, Yang Kwei-sien, a <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, in charge of the Board of Mathematics, accused <a href="../cathen/13520a.htm">Schall</a>, then old and paralyzed, of hostility to Chinese traditions, and obtained against him a sentence of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> (15 April, 1665), which was not carried out; when K'ang-hi took the power in hand, the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Yang were discovered, thanks to the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Father, <a href="../cathen/15346a.htm">Ferdinand Verbiest</a>, who was appointed in Yang's place head of the Board of Mathematics. It was <a href="../cathen/15346a.htm">Verbiest</a> and not <a href="../cathen/13520a.htm">Schall</a> who cast the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> instruments of the Peking observatory, some of which date from the Mongol period. The arrival of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Missions Etrang&egrave;res of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> sent by <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> to Peking gave a new emphasis to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missions.

<p>In March, 1692, Ku Pa-tai, President of the Board of Rites and some of his colleagues addressed to the emperor a note to the effect that as the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> were not guilty of any breach of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, it seemed unfair to prohibit their religion; that it would be proper therefore to let churches subsist and to allow <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> bearing perfumes and other offerings freedom to enter them. An imperial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> approved of this note, and copies were sent to all the provincial governors. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, as astronomers or interpreters, were in high favor at court and the question of rites which was disadvantageous to other missionaries, did not impair their credit during the reign of K'ang-hi. Matters were different under Yung Cheng, son and successor of K'ang-hi, who in 1724 issued an edict exiling to Canton all missionaries except those occupying various offices at Court; in 1736, an edict of K'ien Lung, son and successor of Yung Cheng, prohibited the teaching of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> under penalty of death. On 25 June, 1746, a cruel <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> broke out in Fu-kien, during which the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, Bishop Sanz, and four other <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, Serrano, Alcobar, Royo, and Diaz were <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> Attimis and Henriquez were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> at Su-chou on 12 Sept., 1748. A great change was made in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> at Peking, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> being replaced by the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>.

<p>During the Kia K'ing period (1796-1820), <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was very severe. A <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was issued 4 Sept., 1811, prescribing a search for foreign preachers. There were but seven <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> residing at Court, Ferreira (Fu Wen-kao); Riberio (Li Hung-chen); Serra (Kao Sh&eacute;u-kien), all Portuguese <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> in charge of the observatory; Nan Mi-te, interpreter of the Privy Council; Cajetan Pires (Pei Ho-yuan), a mathematician, and two other missionaries too old to be sent home. Monsignor Dufresse, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tabraca and <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of Sze-ch'wan, was beheaded 14 Sept., 1825; Father Clet, a <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a>. was strangled at Wu-ch'ang (Hu-pe), 18 Feb., 1820. On Sept. 11, 1840, Father Jean-Gabriel Perboyre, a <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a>, was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at Wu-ch'ang. Brighter days were looked for after the signing of a treaty at Wham-poa (1844) by the French ambassador, Th&eacute;odose de Lagren&eacute;, expectations which were fulfilled after the Peking convention of 1860.

<p>In an edict of 20 Feb., 1846, Tao-kwang ordered that the establishments belonging formerly to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> be restored to their owners, and that henceforward officers searching for and arresting harmless <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> should be tried. The edict was not sent to all the governors, and the same year the missionaries, Hue and Gabet, were arrested at Lhassa and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Father Navarro in Hu-pe, and all were taken under escort to Canton and Macao; it was not till the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of 1860 that the churches of Peking were surrendered to Bishop Mouly. The <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of Auguste Chapdelaine (Missions Etrang&egrave;res de Paris) at Si-lin-hien, in Kwang-si on 29 Feb., 1856, was the pretext chosen by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to join <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in a military action against <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. Special privileges were awarded to missions by Art. XIII of the French treaty of T'ien-tsin (1858) and Art. VI of the French Peking Convention (1860). The old churches of the capital were restored to the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, and passports for inland travel or sojourn issued to twenty-eight missionaries. Korea, already ill-famed on account of the massacre of Monsignor Imbert and Fathers Chastan and Maubant on 21 Sept., 1839, was the scene of a terrible <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> in 1866; Bishop Berneux, with Fathers de Breteni&egrave;res, Beaulieu, and Dorie (8 March), Pourthi&eacute; and Petitnicolas (11 March), the coadjutor Bishop Daveluy, and Fathers Auma&aelig;tre (30 March) were all decapitated. Of the flourishing establishment of the Missions Etrang&egrave;res de Paris, there were only Fathers Ridel, later on <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, F&eacute;ron, and Calais. This led to an intervention of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in Korea which did not, however, achieve any great degree of success. Things were going from bad to worse in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. In Kwang-tung Fathers Verch&egrave;re (1867), Dejean (1868), Delavay (1868), were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>; in Sze-ch'wan, Fathers Mabileau (29 Aug., 1865) and Rigaud (2 Jan., 1869) were <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> at Yeu-yang-chou, near <a href="../cathen/08713a.htm">Kwei-chou</a>, and Fathers Gilles and <a href="../cathen/09106a.htm">Lebrun</a> were ill-treated (1869-70); anti-foreign placards were posted up in Hu-nan (1869); the French minister, Count de Rochechouart, was nearly <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> at T'ai-yuan, in the Shan-si province (1869). Finally came the massacre of T'ien-tsin, 21 June, 1870. Fontanier. The French consul, Simon, his chancellor, <a href="../cathen/14697c.htm">Thomassin</a>, the interpreter and his wife, the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> father Chevier and the Cantonese <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Hu, Challemaison, a merchant and his wife, ten sisters of St. Vincent of Paul, Bassoff and Protopopoff, Russian merchants, and the wife of the latter--in all twenty-two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> with great barbarity.

<p>The Franco-Prussian War prevented <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> from taking any energetic action in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, but a special mission, headed by the High Commissioner, Ch'ung Hou, was sent to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to apologize. The lack of retaliation on the part of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> encouraged Prince Kung to send the foreign <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> at Peking (1871) a memorandum relating to missions and regulations to be applied to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missionaries. This circular note met with a protest, not only from the French Minister Rochechouart (14 Nov. 1871), but also from Mr. Wade, British Minister. The <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of the German missionaries, Nies and Heng(1 Nov., 1897), in the Shang-tung province, led to the occupation of Kiao-chou by the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>. On 14 Oct., 1898, Chan&egrave;s was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> at Pak-tung (Kwang-tung); Victorin Delbrouck, a <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a>, was killed in Hu-pe (11 Dec., 1898); satisfaction was given by the Chinese for these crimes, which had been perpetrated in the face of two imperial decrees that same year, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 12 July and 6 October. The Boxer rebellion brought sad days for the missions. The list of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> is lengthy. The following <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>: Fatosati of Northern Hu-nan, Grassi and Fogolla of Shan-si, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>; Guillon, Missions Etrang&egrave;res of <a href="../cathen/09585a.htm">Manchuria</a>, Hamer (Dutch) of Kan-su (burnt to death), and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, Ceseda and Joseph (Hu-nan); Facchini, Saccani, Balat, and Egide (Shan-si); Ebert (Hu-pe); the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Andlauer, Isor&eacute;, Denn, and Mangin (Chi-li); the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> d'Addosio, Garrigues, Dor&eacute;, Chavanne (Peking); Emonet, Viaud, Agnius, Bayart, Bourgeois, Leray, le Gu&eacute;val, Georjon, Souvignet, of <a href="../cathen/09585a.htm">Manchuria</a>, all of the Missions Etrang&egrave;res de Paris; Segers, Heirman, Mallet, Jaspers, Zylmans, <a href="../cathen/01007d.htm">Abbeloos</a>, Dobbe, of <a href="../cathen/10479b.htm">Mongolia</a>, all of the Congregation of Scheut.

<p>Mention should be made of the fact that in 1895, the French Minister G&eacute;rard made an agreement with the <em>Tsung-li Yamen</em> that all passages in the official code disadvantageous to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> should be erased. The Berthemy Convention, finally settled by M. G&eacute;rard (spoken of below), and the reorganization of the protectorates and the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, treated of hereafter, are the chief events of the last few years.
<h2>The question of rites</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/13034a.htm">Father Ricci</a>, the first superior of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, had remarkable success in his work of evangelizing because of the great tolerance he showed the cult rendered by the Chinese to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, to <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucius</a>, and to ancestors. Indeed, mandarins being <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to honor officially <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> and <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucius</a> on certain days, it would have been difficult to convert any of them if they had not been allowed to carry out the functions of their office. Ancestor worship is, practically, the principal religion of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. <a href="../cathen/13034a.htm">Ricci's</a> successor, Longobardi, was of a different mind and finally in 1628, when Emmanuel Diaz (Junior) was vice-provincial, a meeting was called to study the question, but no decision was reached. Affairs reached a crisis when the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Moralez, and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a>, arrived in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> (1633). Excess of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of local customs, or some such reason was the cause of the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> (1637). In addition to different views about the religion of the Chinese, there was another cause of discord between the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. The former were protected by <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and their protectors were at <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a>. The latter were <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, and they looked for support to Manila. In 1639, Moralez addressed to Diaz Senior, then Visitor of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> mission, a memorandum in twelve articles regarding Chinese practices. Diaz having delayed his answer, Moralez went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and on 12 Sept., 1645, obtained from <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> condemning the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> thereupon dispatched to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> Martin Martini, who after a stormy voyage was carried to the <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norwegian</a> coast, and was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to cross <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He succeeded in having a contradictory <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> issued by <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> (23 March, 1656). Then followed a new memorandum of Moralez to the Sacred Congregation (1661), and a new <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/04028a.htm">Clement IX</a> against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (20 Nov., 1669). Moralez died (1664) but his successor as prefect of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, <a href="../cathen/10723a.htm">Domingo Fernandez Navarrette</a>, published his "Tratados historicos"; the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, however, found an adversary among themselves. The Chinese <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Gregorio Lopez, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Basilea and <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of Nan-king, sent to the Sacred Congregation a memoir in favour of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>.

<p>New elements were brought into the discussion when <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Missions Etrang&egrave;res arrived in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. The publication in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in 1682, of a work entitled "La Morale pratique des J&eacute;suites", a bitter criticism of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, acted as a firebrand. P&egrave;re le Tellier answered with "D&eacute;fense des Nouveaux Chr&eacute;tiens" (1687), which was later censured at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (23 May, 1694). On 26 March, 1693, Charles Maigrot, of the Missions Etrang&egrave;res, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of Fu-kien, and later <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Conon, issued a mandate condemning the Chinese Rites. Following the example of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, the Missions Etrang&egrave;res sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> Louis de Quemener, who presented the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with Maigrot's mandate (1696). Nicolas Charmot, Maigrot's envoy, obtained a brief from <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> (15 Jan., 1697) and a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> from the Holy Office (3 July, 1697). The works of <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> Comte. "M&eacute;moires sur la Chine" and "Lettre &ecirc; Mgr le Due du Maine sur les c&eacute;r&eacute;monies de la Chine", added fuel to the flame and were censured by the Faculty of Theology of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (18 Oct., 1700), together with the "Hist. de l'edit de l'Empereur de la Chine" by P&egrave;re Le Gobin, S.J. Finally, the Holy Office published a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> prohibiting the Chinese ceremonies (20 Nov., 1704). This was approved by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> who appointed as <em>legatus a latere</em> Charles Thomas de Tournon, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, to carry the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. Tournon arrived at Canton 8 April and was received at Peking by the Emperor K'ang-hi, who was favorable to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (31 Dec., 1705). After various controversies in which Maigrot and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/15476a.htm">Visdelou</a> sided with the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, K'ang-hi, who found the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> better informed about <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> than their adversaries, ordered Tournon to leave Peking (28 Aug., 1705) and banished Maigrot (17 Dec., 1705). Tournon issued a mandate at Nan-king (25 Jan., 1707). When he arrived at <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a> he was thrown into a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> where he died (8 June 1710) immediately after being named a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. On 19 March, 1715, <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> issued the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ex ill&acirc; die". A new <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, Mezzabarba, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>, was sent to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. He arrived at <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a> (26 Sept., 1720), went to Peking and was received by the emperor, who refused to accede to his demands. Finally, the whole knotty question was settled (11 July, 1742) by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, "Ex quo singulari" condemning the Chinese ceremonies and choosing the expression <em>T'ien-chu</em> which was to be used exclusively to designate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Missionaries to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> had to take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> not to discuss at any time the terms of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. The bitterness of this celebrated quarrel was greatly increased by various causes: the rivalry of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> for the protectorate of the missions, the disputes between the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a>; while the final decision was delayed as much by the question of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> as the rites themselves. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> having spoken, no more can be said here on the question, but it may be noted that the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ex quo singulari" was a terrible blow to the missions in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>; there are fewer <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> than formerly and none among the higher classes, as were the princes and mandarins of the court of K'ang-hi.
<h2>Creation of vicariates apostolic</h2>

<p>In 1577 <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> created for <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, and the Far Eastern Islands, the <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Diocese of Macao</a>, which was divided in 1587 into two diocese, <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a> and Funay (Japan). On 9 Sept., 1659, <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> erected from the territory included within the <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Diocese of Macao</a>, two <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariates Apostolic</a>, one including besides Tong-king the Chinese provinces of Yun-nan, Kwei-chou, Hu-kwang (now Hu-pe and Hu-nan), Sze-ch'wan, Kwang-si, and Laos, the other including, in addition to Cochin-China, the Chinese provinces of Che-kiang, Fu-kien, Kwang-tung, Kiang-si, and the island of Hai-nan. In 1690, <a href="../cathen/01295a.htm">Alexander VIII</a>, to satisfy the Portuguese, created the Diocese of Peking, including Chi-li, Shang-tung, Shan-si, Shen-si, Ho-nan, Lao-tung, Korea, and Tatary, and the Diocese of Nan-king, both diocese being under the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>. By a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 15 Oct, 1696, <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> erected the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariates Apostolic</a> of Shen-si and Shan-si by taking part of the territory included in the Diocese of Peking (Chi-li, Shang-tung, Lao-tung, Korea, and Tatary), and limited the Diocese of Nan-king to Kiang-nan and Ho-nan. The following vicariates were created out of the Diocese of Nan-king (1696): Hu-kwang, Fu-kien, Che-kiang, Kiang-si, Yun-nan, Sze-ch'wan, Kwai-chou; in 1737, these last two provinces were joined into one vicariate, to which Yu-nan was added in 1781. In 1840, Yun-nan was again detached, and in 1846 Kwei-chou became independent. In 1858 Sze-ch'wan was subdivided into Eastern and Western Sze-ch'wan. In 1860, Eastern Sze-ch'wan, with part of Western Sze-ch'wan, was divided into the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariates Apostolic</a> of Southern Sze-ch'wan and Eastern Sze-ch'wan. In 1790, Fu-kien, Che-kiang, and Kiang-se were combined into one vicariate, but in 1838 divided into the vicariates of Fu-kien and Che-kiang Kiang-se. In 1883, Amoy was separated from Fu-kien; in 1846 Kiang-se was separated from Che-kiang; in 1879 the vicariates of Northern and Southern Kiang-se were erected; in 1885 the vicariate of Eastern Kiang-se was created. In 1762, Hu-kwang was amalgamated with Shan-si and Shen-si but separated in 1838. Out of Hu-kwang were formed in 1856 the vicariates of Hu-nan and Hu-pe; in 1879 Hu-nan was divided into the vicariates of Northern and Southern Hu-nan; in 1876, Hu-pe was divided into Eastern, Western, and Northern Hu-pe. In 1843 Shen-si and Shan-si were separated; in 1885 Shen-si was divided into two vicariates, and in 1890 Shan-si was divided in a similar manner.

<p>From the Diocese of Peking, Korea was detached in 1831, Liao-tung, <a href="../cathen/09585a.htm">Manchuria</a>, etc. in 1838, and Shang-tung in 1839; in 1856 the Diocese of Peking was divided into three vicariates: Northern, South-Western, and South-Eastern Chi-li; from the last-named, eastern Chi-li was separated in 1899. In 1883, Shan-tung was divided into Northern and Southern Shan-tung; Eastern Shan-tung was detached in 1894. In 1840 the vicariates of <a href="../cathen/10479b.htm">Mongolia</a> and Kang-su were separated from <a href="../cathen/09585a.htm">Manchuria</a> and later sub-divided; in 1843, Hong-Kong was taken from <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a>; at first a prefecture, it was erected into a vicariate in 1874; the two provinces of Kwang-tung and Kwang-si were detached from <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a> in 1856 and formed into a prefecture, but were erected into separate prefectures in 1878. In 1856 Ho-nan was divided from the Diocese of Nan-king, and was erected into a vicariate which was later subdivided.
<h2>Religious orders</h2>
<h3>The Society of Jesus</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> founders of the missions in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, after evangelizing <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> and <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, died in December, 1552, on the island of Shang-ch'wan (St. John's) before he could reach Macao or Canton. His successors, Alessandro Valignani (d. 20 Jan., 1606), Michele Ruggierei (d. 11 May, 1607), and Francisco Pasio (d. 30 Aug., 1612) did not penetrate beyond these two places and Chao-k'ing in the same province. <a href="../cathen/13034a.htm">Matteo Ricci</a> had the honor of being the pioneer missionary at Peking; he was born at <a href="../cathen/09492a.htm">Macerata</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 6 Oct., 1552, and arrived at <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a> in 1583, meeting there with Ruggieri. From Chou-k'ing <a href="../cathen/13034a.htm">Father Ricci</a> went to Nan-ch'ang (1595); he visited Peking twice (1595 and 1598) where he finally settled, leaving Nan-king for the last time 18 May, 1600. He left behind him Lazzaro Cattaneo and Jo&iuml;o da Rocha, who in 1603 <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, under the name of Paul, the celebrated Siu Kwang-k'i. The latter on going to Peking showed himself a stanch supporter of <a href="../cathen/13034a.htm">Ricci</a>, who died 11 May, 1610. <a href="../cathen/13034a.htm">Ricci</a> was the first superior of the Peking mission.

<p>Most of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of this mission were Italian, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a>, Spanish, German, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a>, or <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a>; but few were French. In 1685, however, <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, king of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, sent six <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to the Far East: Guy Tachard remained in <a href="../cathen/13765a.htm">Siam</a>, but Jean de Fontaney, Joachim Bouvet, Louis de Comte, <a href="../cathen/06471a.htm">Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Gerbillion</a> and <a href="../cathen/15476a.htm">Claude de Visdelou</a>, who reached <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> 23 July, 1687, laid the foundation of the celebrated French Peking mission, which lasted till the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Society</a>.

<p>Their mission under the protectorate of the French king was distinct from the mission of the other <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who were known in a general manner as "Portuguese", to distinguish them from their French brethren. The superiors of the French mission were: Jean de Fontaney (1687), <a href="../cathen/06471a.htm">Gerbillion</a> (1699), Dentrecolles (1706), Julien-Placide Hervieu (1719), Joseph Labbe (1736), Hervieu, a second time (1740), Valentin Ch&acirc;lier (1745), Jean Sylvain de Neuvialle (1747), Louis-Marie Du <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm">Gad</a> (1752), Neuvialle, a second time (1757), Joseph-Louis Le Febrve (1762), John-Baptiste de la Roche (1769), and Fran&iuml;ois Bourgeois.

Among these are: (1) Maps of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. This labour was undertaken by order of the Emperor K'ang-hi and executed between 1708 and 1718, under the direction of Father Jartoux, by Bouvet, Cardoso, Bonjour (Augustinian), Mailla, <a href="../cathen/07358a.htm">Hinderer</a>, de Tartre, and especially <a href="../cathen/06303a.htm">Fridelli</a> and R&eacute;gis. They were the basis of d'Anville's celebrated maps issued between 1729 and 1734. (2) "D&eacute;scription geographique de la Chine" by J. B.

This work was reprinted in 1780-83 by Yves-Mathurin-Marie de Querbeuf. There have been numerous editions and translations since. (4) "M&eacute;moires concernant l'histoire, les sciences . . . des Chinois" (Paris, 1776-1814), containing a mass of information sent mainly by <a href="../cathen/01430a.htm">Amiot</a> and <a href="../cathen/03767b.htm">Cibot</a>, and edited by Brotier, Br&eacute;quigney, and others; the last volume, containing the end of the history of the T'ang dynasty, was edited by Sylvestre de Sacy. (5) Sixteen plates drawn by order of Emperor K'ien-lung to commemorate his conquests in Central <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. The artists at Peking were <a href="../cathen/02061c.htm">Jean-Denis Attiret</a> (d. 8 Dec., 1768), Jean Damasc&egrave;ne, Giuseppe Castiglioni, Ignaz Sichelbarth, all <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> except Damasc&egrave;ne, an Augustinian. The plates were engraved at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> under the direction of C.N. Cochin. Besides <a href="../cathen/02061c.htm">Attiret</a> there was another <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> at the imperial court, Giuseppe Panzi (b. at Cremons, 2 May, 1734).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had four churches at Peking. The Northern or French church (<em>Pe-t'ang</em>), the Southern or Portuguese church (<em>Nun-t'ang</em>), the Western church (<em>Si-t'ang</em>), and the Eastern church (<em>Tung-t'ang</em>), the old house of <a href="../cathen/13520a.htm">Adam Schall</a>. The two beautiful cemeteries of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> outside the walls of Peking, one Portuguese (Sha-la-eul or T&eacute;ng-kong-che-lan), the other French (Ch'eng-fu-sse), were destroyed by the Boxers in 1900. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had residences in the provinces of Chi-li, Shan-si, Shen-si, Shan-tung, Ho-nan, Sze-ch'wan, Hu-kwang, Kiang-si, Kiang-nan, Che-kiang, Fu-kien, Kwang-tung, and Kwang-si. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, on their <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression</a> in 1773, were replaced by the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Nan-king, Xavier von Laimbeckhoven, an Austrian, died 22 May, 1787, near Su-chou. There were but few fathers at Peking when the news of the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Society</a> reached the Chinese capital, Sept., 1774. <a href="../cathen/01323a.htm">Hallerstein</a> and Benolt died of grief; the last member, Louis de Poirot, died before Oct., 1815.

<p>In 1841, Luigi de Besi, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Shan-tung and Ho-nan, was also placed temporarily in charge of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Nan-king. The work was too heavy for one man, and Monsignor de Besi wrote to the General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (18 Sept., 1841), asking that some missionaries be sent to help him as soon as possible. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Kiang-nan had already applied to the general, the Very Rev. Father Roothan (25 April, 1832) to the Queen of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> (1838), and to <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a> (1840). At last, two <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Claude Gotteland (b. in <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, 12 June, 1803; d. at Shanghai, 17 July, 1856), and Eug&egrave;ne-Martin-Fran&iuml;ois Est&egrave;ve (b. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 26 March, 1807; d. at Zi-ka-wei, 1 July, 1848), arrived at Shanghai, 12 June, 1842. Soon afterwards they were joined by Benjamin Brueyre (b. 20 May, 1810; d. at Hien-hien, 24 Feb., 1880), who had remained in the Chusan Islands, then held by the British. Monsignor de Besi then had as successor Monsignor Martesca (d. 1885), and Monsignor Spelta, transferred in 1856 to Hu-pe. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was left in charge of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, Andr&eacute; Borgniet (b. 14 Feb., 1811; d. 31 July, 1862, at Hien-hien), who was finally <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Berisa and appointed <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, 2 October, 1859. The mission of K'iang-nan suffered much during the T'ai-p'ing rebellion, when Father Luigi Massa and Victor Wuillaume were massacred.

<p>An important magnetic and meteorological observatory has been erected in the neighborhood of Shanghai, at the village of Zi-ka-wei, so called in the local dialect on account of the proximity of the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the celebrated convert Paul Siu, under the direction of Father Augustin Colobel (1873-74), Henri Le Lee (1875-76), Marc Dechevrens (1877-87), Bernard Ooms (1888, 1891), Stanislas Chevalier (1889-97), Louis Froe (1888). Here are published valuable bulletins and memoirs which render the greatest service to navigators by forecasts of the weather, special study being made of typhoons. A yearly calendar full of useful data is also issued. An <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> observatory was also established at Zo-se (Che-shan) in 1899 by Father Beaurepaire. Since 1901 annals have been published; in 1897-98, the director, Stanislas Chevalier, surveyed the Upper Yang-tze from I-ch'ang to P'ing-shan-hien and published a fine folio atlas of the great river, consisting of sixty-four sheets (1899). Under the direction of <a href="../cathen/07308a.htm">Pierre Heude</a> (b. at Foug&egrave;res, Brittany, 25 June, 1836; d. at Zi-ka-wei, 3 Jan., 1902) a museum of natural history was started, in connection with which were issued "M&eacute;moires concernant l'historie naturelle de l'empirechinois" which are of great interest. Mention should also be made of the valuable series of monographs (twenty-five up to 1908) printed under the general heading "Vari&eacute;t&eacute;s sinologiques"; in this work Henri Havret took the leading part after 1892. These monographs treat of various provinces, of examinations, of the Great Canal, of landed <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, etc. It may be added that Fathers Couvreur, Debesse, and Petillion published good guides or dictionaries of the Chinese language, and Angelo Zottoli compiled the "Cursus Litterature sinic&aelig;". The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of this mission belong to the province of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Since 1903, a quarterly under the title "Relations du Chine" has been issued at the head-quarters in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>.

<p>In 1856 part of the Chi-li province was also entrusted to the care of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and Adrien Languillat (b. 28 Sept., 1808; d. at Zi-ka-wei, 29 Nov., 1878) was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 22 March, 1857, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13727c.htm">Sergiopolis</a>, and was the first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of South-Eastern Chi-li. This mission suffered greatly during the Boxer Rebellion. Some of its members have distinguished themselves by their publications, e.g., S&eacute;raphin Couvreur (b. 14 Jan., 1856), who compiled large dictionaries and made translations of the Chinese classics; Leo Wieger (b. 9 July, 1856), author of "Rudiments de la langue chinoise". The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of this mission belong to the province of Champagne, the head-quarters being at <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>. Since November, 1898, they have edited a periodical entitled "Chine, <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>, Madagascar".
<h3>Dominicans</h3>

<p>The first missionary to arrive in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> in modern times was the Portuguese <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Gaspar da Cruz (1555), whose successors were expelled by the mandarins, the latters' fears having been aroused. Gaspar da Cruz wrote a book entitled "Tractado . . . da China" (1569). The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> mission was created in 1631 and 1633 in the Fu-kien province by Angelo Coqui and Thomas Serra. The well-known <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Juan Bautista de Moralez (b. at Eeija, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 1597; d. in Fu-kien, 17 Sept., 1664), who took an energetic part in the question of the Rites, arrived in 1637. In 1747, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Bishop Sanz, of Maurocastrum, was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> with Fathers Alcobar, Royo, Diaz, and Bishops Francisco Serrano. Francisco Varo (Wan Tai-kwo), who arrived in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> in 1654, published the "Arte de la Lengua mandarina" (Canton. 1703), which was the basis of Fourmont's "Grammatica Duplex". Beginning in 1866, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> printed for many years at <a href="../cathen/09597b.htm">Manila</a> "El Correo Sino-Annamita", which embodied the letters from their missionaries in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, Formosa, and Tong-king. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> have but two vicariates in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>: Fu-kien and Amoy (the latter embracing Formosa), the Phillipine Islands being the centre of their activity.
<h3>Franciscans</h3>

<p>In 1579, Pedro d'Alfaro, guardian of the province of St. Joseph, in the Phillipine Islands, with Giovanni Battista of <a href="../cathen/11738b.htm">Pesaro</a>, Sebastian de Baera (or of St. Francis), and Augustin de Tordesillas, made a stay of seven months in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, but the first <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> with a special mission to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> was Antonio de Santa Maria (Li, b. at Baltanas, <a href="../cathen/11417c.htm">Palencia</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; died at Canton, 13 May, 1669), who was sent to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> in May, 1633, and took an active part in their discussion over the Rites. Among the most remarkable of these <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> should be mentioned Basilio Brollo, better known as Baile de Glenmona (Ye T'sung-hien, b. at Gemona, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 25 March, 1648; d. in the Shen-si province, 13 August, 1703), who went to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> in 1860, became <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Shen-si in 1700; compiler of the Chinese-Latin dictionary "Han-se-tze-yi", copied by De Guignes in his great work published in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1813, by order of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a>. Also Carlo Orazio Castorano (eighteenth century), author of many works. Most of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> are Italian, though Eastern Shan-tung was made a separate <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> in 1894, for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>.
<h3>Augustinians</h3>

<p>In 1577, two Spanish Augustinians, Pedro Martin de Herrada and Geronimo Marin, came to Fu-kien, where they remained but four months and sixteen days. The first general work on <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> was written by the Augustinian Juan Gonzales de Mendo&iuml;a (Rome, 1585) and translated into most languages. It was not until 1680 that Alvaro de Benevente arrived in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>; he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01766b.htm">Ascalon</a> and placed at the head of the newly created vicariate of Kiang-si (1699) with his residence at Kan-chou. He died suddenly at <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a> in 1705 and was not replaced, the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Fu-kien taking charge also of Kiang-si and Che-kiang. The Augustinians had been absent from <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> for some time, when, it 1879, they sent from <a href="../cathen/09597b.htm">Manila</a> Elias Francisco Su&aacute;rez and Agust&aelig;n Villanueva to take charge of part of Hu-nan which on 19 Sept. was erected into a vicariate under Saturin de la Torre.
<h3>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Missions Estrang&egrave;res</h3>

<p>The creation in 1622 of the <em>Sacra Congregatio de Propagand&acirc; Fide</em> made it possible to centralize the work of missions in order that their wants might be studied and their field of action broadened. No apostle was more eager than <a href="../cathen/13024a.htm">Alexandre de Rhodes, S.J.</a>* (b. at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, 15 March, 1591; d. at <a href="../cathen/08192b.htm">Ispahan</a>, 5 Nov., 1660) in appealing to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to make known the want of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for numerous missions. He had thoroughly studied the question and travelled extensively in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, Cochin-China, Tong-king, and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Pope Innocent X</a> wished to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> <a href="../cathen/13024a.htm">P&egrave;re de Rhodes</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but through modesty the missionary declined this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. His reward was to consist in the success of the cause he so warmly advocated. On 7 August, 1651, <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> begged the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to appoint a patriarch, two or three <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, and twelve <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to the various churches of Eastern <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. By a brief of 17 August, 1658, <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> nominated Fran&iuml;ois Pallu, Canon of <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Heliopolis, and Pierre de la Motte Lambert, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Berytus, to take charge of the missions in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> and the neighboring countries, with the power of choosing a third <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. Their choice fell on Cotolendi, vicar of Sainte-Madeleine at Aix-en-Provence. The <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> asked <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> for authority to found a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for the conversion of infidels and the training of missionaries. Jean Duval, in religion Dom Bernard of St. Theresa, a Barefooted <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> and <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Babylon, donated a suitable site in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (16 March, 1663) and the directors took possession, 27 Oct, 1664. This was the beginning of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Missions Estrang&egrave;res. The first superiors were Vincent de Meurs of Tr&eacute;guier (1664-68) and Michel Gazil of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> (1668-70). The first directors were Michel Gazil (d. 14 Jan., 1697), and Armand Poitevin (d. 1682). Pierre de la Motte Lambert and Jacques de Bourges were the first missionaries who left <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The first departure from the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> took place 8 Nov., 1665. The missionaries embarked at <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a>, 14 March, 1666. The Missions Estrang&egrave;res had <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at Nan-king (Cotolendi died on the journey; Laneau, who resided at <a href="../cathen/13765a.htm">Siam</a>); in the province of Fu-kien (Pallu, 1679-84; Charles Maigrot, 1697-1707); in the province of Sze-ch'wan (Artsu de Lyonne, 1697-1713); in the province of Yun-nan (Philibert le Blanc, 16697; Enjobert de Martillat, 1727-52). Notwithstanding the hostility of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, the Missions Estrang&egrave;res continued to flourish, and today they are spread over a great portion of the <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese Empire</a>, besides having missions in <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, Tong-king, Chocin-China, Cambodia, <a href="../cathen/13765a.htm">Siam</a>, <a href="../cathen/09562a.htm">Malacca</a>, <a href="../cathen/03082a.htm">Burma</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. There is a <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> at Hong-Kong and one at Shang-hai, and a sanatorium (B&eacute;thanie) at Hong-Kong. In the island of Hong-Kong, the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> conducts a printing office at Pakfulum, called "Imprimeriede Nazareth", where books are issued no only in French and Latin, but also in Chinese, Annamite, <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a>, Korean, Cambodian, Bahnar, Malay, and Tibetan. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Missions Estrang&egrave;res have made a special study of languages and have published the following dictionaries: Pigneaux and Taberd, "Dict. Anamito-latinum" (Serampore, 1833); Taberd, "Dict. Latino-Anamiticum" (Serampore, 1838); "Vocabulaire Cochinchinois" (1838); Theurel, "Dict. Anamitico-Latinum" (Ninh-phu, 1877); Ravier, "Dict Latino-Anamiticum" (Ninh-phu, 1880); Pallegoix, "Dict. Linguae Thai" (Paris, 1854); "Dict. cor&eacute;en-fran&iuml;ais" (Yokohama, 1880); "Dict. chinois-fran&iuml;ais (dialect of western <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, Hong-Kong, 1893); Dourisboure, "Dict. Bahnar-fran&iuml;ais" (Hong-Kong, 1889); Desgodins, "Dict. thib&eacute;tain-latin-franccais" (Hong-Kong, 1899).
<h3>Lazarists (Cong. Missionis)</h3>

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> were sent to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> by <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>; Luigi Antonio Appiani (Pie), Johann Mullener (Mo) in 1699, T. Pedrini (Te) in 1710. Appiani (b. at Dogliani, 22 March, 1663; d. 29 Aug., 1732), was vice-visitor in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, Mullener (b. at <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, 4 Oct. 1673; d. 17 Dec. 1742), <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Myriopolis, was the second <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of Sze-ch'wan. Pedrini (born at <a href="../cathen/06043c.htm">Fermo</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; d. at Peking, 10 Dec., 1746) took a very active part in the discussion over the Rites. However it was not until they replaced the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at Peking, that the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> got a firm footing in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> was <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppressed</a> by <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a>, the offer of the succession was declined by the Missions Estrang&egrave;res of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and was finally accepted, though not without reluctance, by the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, and confirmed by a Roman <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 7 Dec., 1783, approved of by Louis XVI of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> at <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a>, 25 Jan., 1784. The superior general, Antoine* Jacquier, chose for the new missions Nicolas-Joseph Raux (b. at Ohain, Hainault, 14 April, 1754; d. 16 Nov. 1801); Jean-Joseph Ghislain (b. at Salles, <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Diocese of Cambrai</a>, 5 May, 1751; d. 12 August, 1812), and Brother Charles Portis. They arrived at Canton, 29 August, 1784. Peking, however, had to be abandoned during the greater part of the nineteenth century, and was finally recovered after the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of 1860, by Bishop Joseph-Martial Moulay (b. at Figeac, 2 Aug., 1807; d. 4 Dec., 1868), <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Northern Chi-li. Monsignor Alphonse-Pierre Favier, a <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a>, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11646a.htm">Pentacomia</a> (b. 22 Sept., 1837), <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Peking during the Boxer rebellion, was one of the successors of Bishop Mouly. Among the remarkable <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, mention may be made of Joachim-Affonso Gon&iuml;alves (b. in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, 23 March, 1781; d. 3 Oct., 1844), a great sinologist, author of "Arte China", and several grammars and dictionaries, and the celebrated naturalist Armand David, (b. at Espalette, 7 Sept., 1826, d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 10 Nov., 1900). The well-known traveller in <a href="../cathen/14718a.htm">Tibet</a>, Evariste-R&eacute;gis Hue (b. at Caylus, 1 June, 1813; d. March 1860) was also a <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a>. In the vicariates administered by the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> are a number of Sisters of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, who are devoted nurses in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> also have charge of the Work of the Holy Childhood, for the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of forsaken native children, with headquarters at T'ing-hi (Chusan Island). The <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> have a <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> at Shanghai. Since 1832 they have published the "Annales de la Congr&eacute;gation de la Mission". The head-quarters of the mission at at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>.
<h3>The Belgian Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (Imm. Cord. B.M.V. de Scheutveld)</h3>

<p>This congregation was established at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> by a retired military <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>, Th&eacute;ophile Verbist (b. at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, 1823; d. in <a href="../cathen/10479b.htm">Mongolia</a>, 24 Feb., 1868). His first companion was Van Segvelt, and he was soon joined by Fran&iuml;ois Vranckx and Verlinden, and later by Jacques Bax and Ferdinand Hamer, who were afterwards <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> missions extended over <a href="../cathen/10479b.htm">Mongolia</a>, Kan-su, and Central <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. In February, 1889, this congregation established the periodical "Missions en Chine et au Congo", published at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> in both French and <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a>. The head-quarters of the missions are at Scheutveld near <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>.
<h3>Foreign Missions of Milan (Sem. Mediol. Miss. Ext.)</h3>

<p>A new <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was established at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 31 July, 1850, by Monsignor A. Ramazzotti, later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, with the help of Fathers Reina, Mazzucconi, Salerio, Ripamonti, and Giuseppe Marinoni (b. at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 11 Oct, 1810; d. 27 Jan., 1891). The last named was the real founder of the order and its first director. The head-quarters are at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>.
<h3>Priests of Steyl</h3>

<p>(Sem. Steylen. pro Miss. Ext. Soc. Verbi Divini) This congregation was founded in 1875 by <a href="../cathen/16047a.htm">Arnold Janssen</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">Diocese of M&uuml;nster</a> (Westphalia), <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of the Ursaline Sisters at Kempen (<a href="../cathen/11415b.htm">Rhenish Prussia</a>), and editor of the "Kliner Herz Jesu Bote", at Steyl (Holland), near Tegelen and Venloo. The new German congregation obtained from the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> the concession of part of Shan-tung of which Johann Baptist Anzer was appointed pro-vicar, 2 Jan., 1882, and <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, 22 Dec. 1885. When Bishop Anzer of Telepta died (24 Nov., 1903), he was replaced by Bishop Henninghaus. This mission is under German protectorate, with head-quarters at Steyl.
<h3>The Seminary of Sts. Peter and Paul (Sem. SS. Apost. Petri et Pauli de Urbe)</h3>

<p>Founded at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1874; has a small mission in <a href="../cathen/13756a.htm">Southern Shen-si</a>.
<h2>Protectorate</h2>

<p>The partition of the newly-found lands by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, at the end of the fifteenth century, assigned <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, which had the control of missionaries in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> (8 Jan., 1454). The first blow struck at this protectorate was the creation of the <em>Sacra Congregatio de Propagand&acirc; Fide</em> by <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a>, 22 June, 1622, and the appointment of two <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> in 1658. The next was the sending of five <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> in 1685, by <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, who pledged himself to protect his subjects. The rivalry of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in this mission field was no slight factor in the failure of the special missions of Cardinal de Tournon. <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> took the place of <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at Peking with the agreement of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. When the Portuguese <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Gaetao Pires, died at Peking, 2 Nov. 1838, his country did not name a successor and his place was taken by the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> and their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Mouly. The French ambassador, Th. Lagren&eacute;, signed a treaty at Whampoa, 24 Oct., 1844, in which it is stipulated (art. XXIII) that the French shall have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to establish churches, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and cemeteries. Again in Art. XIII of the French Treaty of T'ien-tsin. it was stipulated that protection should be granted to missionaries travelling with regular passports in the interior of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, and that all edicts against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> should be abrogated. By art. VI of the French Peking Convention of 1860, it was agreed that all the buildings confiscated by the Chinese should be restored to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> through the French Legation at Peking. Four churches of the capital, or their sites, were then surrendered to the French Ambassador, Baron Gros, who issued passports to twenty-eight missionaries of various congregations and nationalities. <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> did not protest or interfere, leaving <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> undisturbed in the exercise of her protectorate over all the missions in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>.

<p>On 20 February, 1865, M. Berthemy, the French Minister at Peking, had a correspondence with the Tsung-il Yamen, with regard to the purchase of lands and houses by French missionaries. The question was definitely settled by M. G&eacute;rard, 14 April, 1895, and the agreement is known as the "Berthemy Convention". In 1885 an attempt was made to send a <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> or <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to Peking, but when <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> observed that it would interfere with her protectorate, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> did not insist. In 1890-91, after lengthy negotiations with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the German Bishop Anzer of Shan-tung, the German Government succeeded in having German missions placed under its protectorate. Of course <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> could not object to the protection given by a sovereign to his own subjects. Arrangements have also been made with <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> for the protection of Italian subjects, but the matter is not so simple in this case on account of the relations between the Italian Government and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. These claims have no practical effect on the protectorate of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, which, with the Mission Etrang&egrave;res of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, has the lion's share in this immense field of evangelization.
<h2>Hierarchy</h2>

<p>An important imperial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 15 March, 1899, established on an official basis the relations between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the local authorities of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were placed on an equal footing with the viceroys and the governors, the vicars-general ranked with the treasurers, provincial judges and Tao-t'ai, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> with prefects. This <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was signed at the suggestion of Bishop Favier of Peking, but its wisdom has been much disputed.

There is at Hong-Kong a Procurator General of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> for Chinese and Indo-Chinese missions.
<h2>Manich&aelig;ans</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> were called by the Chinese <em>Mo-ni</em>, a transcription of <em>M&acirc;ni</em>; they are mentioned as earlier as 631 and were intimately connected with the Uigars, who suffered a crushing defeat, 13 Feb., 843. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as a result of that defeat, in the edict of 845, prohibiting all foreign <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, the Mo-ni are not mentioned. Probably it is the language of the Mo-ni, not of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> or of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> that is mentioned in the Kara-Belgasun inscription in the first half of the ninth century. However, a passage of the Chinese work, "Fo-tsu-t'ung-ki", mentions the Mo-ni as "still existing in the Three Mountains", on the right bank of the Yang-tze above Nan-king.
<h2>Protestant missions</h2>

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> (<em>Ye-su-kiao</em>) worker among the Chinese was Joshua Marshman, though he did not go to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, his labours being carried on in Bengal, at Serampore, where he died 7 Dec., 1837. The actual founder of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> missions to the Chinese was Robert Morrison (Ma Li-sun), born of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scottish</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> at Buller's Green, in Northumberland, 5 Jan., 1872; he entered the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Missionary Society in 1805, commenced the study of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> with a Chinaman, Yong Sam-tak, and on 31 Jan., 1807, he embarked for <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> via America. On 4 Sept., he reached Macao, whence he proceeded to Canton, where he died, 1 Aug., 1834. he published many works in Chinese and English, the best known of which is "A Dictionary of the Chinese Language", published at <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a>, at the press of the East <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> Co. (1815-23). Morrison was followed by William Milne (b. 1785; d. 2 June, 1822), principal of the Anglo-Chinese College of <a href="../cathen/09562a.htm">Malacca</a> and Walter Henry Medhurst (b. 29 April, 1796; d. 24 Jan., 1957). In 1827 Karl Friedrich G&uuml;tzlaff (b. at Pyritz, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, 8 July, 1803); d. at Hong-Kong, 1851) was sent to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> by the Nederlandsch Zendelinggenootschap. On 19 Feb., 1830, Elijah Coleman Bridgman (b. 22 April, 1801, at Belchertown, Mass.; d. 2 Nov., 1861) arrived, the first agent of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Then came (1834) William Dean, for the American Baptist Missionary Union; Henry Lockwood (1835) for the Board of Foreign Missions of the protestant Episcopal Church in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>; G. Tradescant Lay (1836), for the British and Foreign Bible Society; Edward B. Squire (1836) for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Missionary Society. In 1847, the German Missions of Basil and the Rhine sent representatives. The <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> Inland Mission which is still in full vigour was started in 1862 by James Meadow. During the last few years American and Scandinavian missions have greatly increased.

<p>Among the noteworthy <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> missionaries not already named, the following may be mentioned; Americans: David Abeel (b. New Brunswick, N. J., 12 June, 1804; d. 4 Sept. 1846); S. W. Bonney (b. 8 March, 1815, at New Canaan, Conn.; d. 27 July, 1864); William Jones Boone (d. 17 July, 1864), the first missionary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; Justus Doolittle (b. 23 June, 1824; d. 15 June, 1880); W. A. P. Martin, late President of the Peking University; Peter Parker (b. 1804; d. 10 Jan., 1888), at one time American Minister to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>; Samuels Wells Williams (b. at <a href="../cathen/15241b.htm">Utica</a>, N. Y., 22 Sept., 1812; d. 16 Feb., 1884, at New Haven), the greatest of American sinologists, at one time U. S. Charg&eacute; d'Affairs at Peking, and towards the .end of his life, Professor of Chinese at Yale University. British: Carstairs Douglas (b. 27 Dec., 1820; d. at Amoy, 20 July, 1877); Joseph Edkins (d. 23 April, 1905), the author of innumerable books and papers on <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>; Griffith John (b. 1831); James Legge (b. at Huntly, Aberdeenshire, 20 Dec., 1815); d. 29 Nov., 1897), the great scholar and translator of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> classics; Arthur Evans Moulay (arrived at <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> in 1861); J. Hudson Taylor (b. 21 May, 1832; d. 3 June, 1905), who gave a great impulse to the <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> Inland Mission; Alexander Wylie (b. 6 April, 1815; d. 6 Feb, 1887), biographer and historian; the German, Ernst Faber (b. 25 April, 1839; d. 26 Sept., 1899); the Sweden, Th. Hamburg (d. 13 May, 1854).

<p>Medical missions, including the establishment of general and ophthalmic <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> greatly help develop the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> missions. These were at first established at the treaty post only, but now they have spread into the interior of the country, mainly through the medium of the <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> Inland Mission.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> missions suffered greatly during the Boxer Rebellion (1899-1900), losing 188 members (100 Englishmen, 56 Swedes, 32 Americans), in Shang-si and beyond (159), Chi-li (17), Che-kiang (11), and Shang-tung (1). The provinces belonged mainly to the <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> Inland Mission, the Christian and Missionary Alliance, the American Board, etc. At various times no less that 111 <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> have had representatives in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, more than half having begun their work between 1887 and 1907. In 1876 there were 29 <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> working in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, which by 1906 had risen to 82. The question of Rites has been raised among the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> missionaries under the name of the "Term Question", because of a lack of unity in the choice of a term to describe the Deity: <em>Shin, T'ien-shin, T'ien-chu</em>, etc. being proposed. <em>Shang-ti</em> seems to meet the approval of the majority. The Bible or portions of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> have been translated under the auspices of the three Bible <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a>, Foreign, and American, and the National Society of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, into the following dialects: Mandarin, Fu-chou, Canton, Shang-hai, Su-chou, Hakka; Swatow (printed in Chinese characters); Ning-po, Fu-chou, Amoy, Mandarin, Kien-ning, T'ai-chou, Shang-hai, Hakka, Swatow, Hai-nan, Hing-hwa, Wen-chou, Kien-yang, Canton, Peking, Shang-tung, Su-chou (in Roman characters). In 1900 the publications of the Chinese agencies of the three Bible <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> amounted to 1,523,930 copies of the whole Bible or portions thereof (991,300 in Mandarin, 291,900 in simple Wen-li, 187,000 in classical Chinese. etc.). The well-known periodical "The Chinese Repository" was edited from May, 1832 to Dec., 1851 (20 vols.), at Canton, by two American missionaries, E. C. Bridgman, and his successor, S. W. Williams. The "Chinese Recorder", started in May, 1868, at Fu-chou by Rev. S. L. Baldwin has been conducted at Shanghai since January, 1874. On January 1, 1903, according to "The Encyclopedia of Missions" (Dwight, Tupper, and Bliss), <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> missions in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> (including <a href="../cathen/09585a.htm">Manchuria</a>) included 2708 foreign missionaries, 5700 native workers, 3316 places of religious worship. 1570 elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 129 high schools, 138 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> dispensaries, 24 printing establishments, 144,237 professing <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. According to the "Shanghai Mercury" the number of foreign workers (men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>), which in 1873 had been 473, was on 31 Dec., 1907, 3833; the total number of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> being 256,779.
<h2>Russian ecclesiastical mission</h2>

<p>This mission was begun by thirty-one Russians, made <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> at the time of the first siege of Albasin (7 July, 1684), and taken to Peking with the "Pope" Maxim Leontieff. The first mission was started in 1715 by the Archimandrite Hilarion, accompanied by a "pope" and a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>; the mission is first mentioned in a diplomatic document, Article 5 of the treaty signed in 1727 by Count Vladislavitch; the "popes" never tried to make converts; they simply acted as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> to the Albasin refugees and later also to the Russian embassy. Between 1852 and 1866 the members of this mission issued four volumes of memoirs relating to various Chinese subjects; two of the "popes" have left a name in Chinese studies; Father Yakiuf Bichurin, and the Archimandrite <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a>, compiler of a very valuable dictionary. The Russian mission suffered much during the Boxer rebellion, and its valuable <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was destroyed.
<h2>Jews in China</h2>

<p>The first mention of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (<em>Tiao-kin-kiao</em>) is found in the records of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries of Peking. At the beginning of the 17th century, a young <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Israelite</a>, Ngai, on paying a visit (1605) to <a href="../cathen/13034a.htm">Matteo Ricci</a>, declared that he worshipped one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and seeing at the mission a picture of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a> with the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Child</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, he believed it was Rebecca with Esau or Jacob. He stated that he came from K'ai-feng, the capital of Ho-nan, where his brethren resided. However, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, often taken for the <em>Hwei-hwei</em>, or <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, had been mentioned under the name of <em>Chu-hu</em> in the Chinese Annals (Yuan-shi) of 1329, for the first time, and again in 1354. <a href="../cathen/13034a.htm">Ricci</a> sent to K'ai-feng a <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, who was followed later on by Giulio Aleni (1613), Gozanu (1704), <a href="../cathen/06393b.htm">Gaubil</a>, and Domenge. Finally it was discovered that these <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> has a <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> (<em>Li-pai-sze</em>), looking to the east, and possessed many books. Facsimiles of some of the books were made in Shanghai in 1851. Three tablets bearing inscriptions have been found at K'ai-feng: (1) The oldest, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1489, commemorating the reconstruction of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> <em>Ts'ing-chen-sze</em>, states that seventy Jewish <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> arrived in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> at the court of the Sung (960 to 1278). (2) The second, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1512, placed in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> <em>Ts'uen-chang-tao-king-sze</em>, was taken to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> under the Han dynasty. (3) The third, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1663, commemorating the rebuilding of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> <em>Ts'ing-chen-sze</em>, says that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish religion</a> had its origin in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> and was introduced to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> at the time of the Chou (1122-955 B.C.) which is manifestly wrong. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> came to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> through <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> after the capture of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> by Titus, during the first century of the Christian era, under the Emperor Ming-ti of the Han dynasty. This statement is based upon oral tradition. Professor Chavannes writes that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> came to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> from <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> by sea under the Sung dynasty, between 960 and 1126 (Revue de Synth&egrave;se historique, Dec., 1900). Father Joseph Brucker, after reading carefully <a href="../cathen/13034a.htm">Ricci's</a> original <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, finds that his informer, Ngai, stated that there were but ten or twelve <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> at K'ai-feng, where they had been settled but five or six hundred years, and that they were much more numerous at Hang-chou (Etudes, 20 Nov., 1907). This seems to confirm the theory of Chavannes and the text of the inscription of 1489; the arrival of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> at the court of the Sung, which was Ling-ngan, or Hang-chou. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> called themselves <em>Tiao-kin-kiao</em> (the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> which extracts the sinew), referring to the struggle of Jacob with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angel</a> (<a href="../bible/gen032.htm#vrs32">Genesis 32:32</a>); they suffered greatly and were scattered during the T'ai-ping rebellion (1857). They have since gone back to their old seat, but they are neither numerous nor prosperous.
<h2>Mohammedans</h2>

<p>(<em>Hwei-hwei-kiao</em>). The first mention of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, called <em>Ta-shi</em>, is found in the annals of the T'ang dynasty (618-907); in 713 there is a record in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> of a <em>Ta-shi</em> ambassador. In 758, a large <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> colony, settled at Canton, rebelled, burnt their houses, and fled by sea. They had a large mosque (<em>Hwei-sheng-sze</em>), built under the T'ang dynasty, which was destroyed by fire in 1314, and rebuilt in 1349-51; only the ruins of a tower mark the site of the first building. Two inscriptions of the sixteen century refer to the mosques of Nan-king; one of the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> was found at Si-ngan-fu as well as the following which is considered <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> by some savants. <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a> writes (Russian Memoirs, IV, 438) that a <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> tablet was discovered at Si-ngan-fu bearing the date A.D. 742, and recording the fact that during the reign of the Sui emperor, K'ai-h'wang (581-600) <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islamism</a> penetrated into <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. The difficulty is to make this date tally with the Hegira (622). It is the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of the writer that the introduction of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> was gradual. The adherents were first known as <em>Ta-shi</em> (Arabs), but have since been known as <em>Hwei-hwei</em>. They paid tribute to the chief of the Si Lao or Kara K'itai and in the twelfth century there was a regiment of Hwei-hwei in the Kin army. Many distinguished <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> serve in the <a href="../cathen/10479b.htm">Mongol</a> army, among them Nasruddin, who was governor of Yun-nan. In the fourteenth century, some of the Mongol chiefs, Barak Khan, Kabak Khan, and finally the Khakan Tughluk Timur, embraced <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islamism</a>. The influence of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a> in Central <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> rose as the Mongol authority was declining. The <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> geographer, Abu'lfeda, mentions the following cities of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> (<em>Sin</em>): Khanfu (Hang-chou), Khandju, Yandju (Yang-chou), Zaitun (Ts'ean-chou), Khangu, Sila (Korea), Khadjou, Sankdju (Su-chou). The city of Si-ngan was called Khamdan. Ibn Batuta (fourteenth century visited Sin Kalan (Canton), and remarks that in every city of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> there was always a <em>sheikh ul Islam</em> and a <em>cadi</em> to act as judges among the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> called the Chinese emperor <em>Faghfur</em>, an alteration of the Persian <em>Baghpur</em> (Son of God), equivalent to "Son of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>". <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> was <em>Chin</em>, or <em>Mahachin</em>, sometimes <em>Tung-t'u</em>, "Land of the East".

<p>An imperial edict <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 4 May, 1729, says of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>: "They muster strongest in Shen-si, and there they are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> more than anywhere else on account of their clubbings together to gamble, their secreting weapons and various other illegal acts. There they also give expression unreservedly to their wrath about the imperial decrees forbidding the slaughter of horned cattle, which are so indispensable to agriculture. They should therefore be constantly reminded to be kind and tolerant" (De Groot). In 1649 a rebellion broke out in Kan-su, in the part of Western Hwang-ho, and the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> occupied the <em>fus</em> of Kang-chou, Liang-chou, Min-chou, etc. Su-chou was retaken in 1649 by the imperial troops, and the rebel leader, Ting Kwo-tung, was killed with his followers. The 1781, the black-turbaned Salar <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a> dwelling at Si-ning, east of Ku-ku-nor, killed the prefect of Kan-chou, took Ho-chou, and besieged Lan-chou. imperial troops were called from all parts of the empire, and after a fierce resistance and great bloodshed, the chief, Kien-Wu, was killed, and the other leaders were exiled, 1784, to Hai-nan. New difficulties arose in August, 1789, and a number of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a> were sent to Heh-lung-kiang, as slaves to the Tatars. They rebelled again in 1861, 1862, and 1895. In this region they are divided into "white-capped" Hwei-hwei, who burn <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> as the other Chinese do, and "black-capped" Hwei-hwei, or Salar, who condemn this practice as <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>, and are more fanatical. These live at Salar Pakun, in the vicinity of Ho-chou.

<p>In 1855 a quarrel between <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a> and Chinese miners working near Ta-li, in the Yu-nan province, was the occasion of a general rising of all <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> in the region under two chiefs, Ma Te-sing and Ma-hien, who submitted in 1860, though they were victorious. However a young chief, Tu Wen-siu, established himself as a sultan in the stronghold of Ta-li, where he resisted the imperial troops until 19 Jan., 1873, when a wholesale massacre of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> took place. in 1863 another great rebellion broke out in the T'ien-shan province, or Ili, which had been conquered for the empire by K'ien Lung in 1759. Burzuk Khan, a descendant of the ancient chieftains, with the help of Yakub, an adventurer, taking advantage of the difficult position of the Chinese, captured the territory south of t[ien-shan. Eventually Yakub replaced his chief, assumed his title of Ameer, and founded a short-lived empire which came to an end with the death of Yakub and the capture by General Tso Tsung-tang of Aksu, the capital (19 Oct, 1877), Yarkand (21 Dec., 1877), Kashgar (26 Dec., 1877), and Khotan (4 Jan., 1878).

<p>Though some <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> probably visited Mecca between the fifteenth and eighteenth century, there is no mention of them in Chinese literature dealing with <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>. This does not date further back than 1861 The land route of later <em>hadjis</em> (pilgrims) to <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> ran through Ki-fu-kwan, Hami, Turfan, Aksu, Andijan, Khokand, Samarkand, Bokhara, Charjui, Meshed, Hamadan, Kermanshah, <a href="../cathen/02202c.htm">Bagdad</a>, <a href="../cathen/10598b.htm">Mossul</a>, Diarbekir, <a href="../cathen/01283b.htm">Aleppo</a>, <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, Cairo. Some embarked at <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Jaffa</a>; others in Mekran. After leaving Bokhara, they passed through Balkh, Tash-kurgan, Kabul, Kandhar, Kelat. The sea routes were through Ava to Rangoon, or Po-se and the Si-kiang. Of course with the facilities of modern navigation the sea-route is much used. The writer has known one of these hadjis. He could recite the <a href="../cathen/08692a.htm">Koran</a>, although he did not understand what he said, nor could he read Arabic. <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> have many mosques in the large cities of the empire, some of great importance in Peking, Si-ngan, Hang-chou, Canton, etc. In form they are much like <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>, Arabic inscriptions being their characteristic feature. Many <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a> are officials of the empire, some occupying high positions, especially in the army. No accurate statistics are obtainable. According to M. Dabry, who is, however, a very unreliable author, there are in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> between twenty and twenty-two million <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>, of whom 8,350,000 are in Kan-su, 6,500,00 in Shen-si, 3,500,000 to 4,000,000 in Yun-nan. According to A.H. Keane, the numbers reach 30,000,000. Sara Chandra Das places them at 50,000,000 while the late Dr. Andrew Harper brings the figure down to 3,000,000.
