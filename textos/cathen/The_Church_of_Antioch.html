<h1>The Church of Antioch</h1>  

<p>(<em>Antiocheia, Antiochia</em>)
<h2 id="section1">Origin and history of the city</h2>

<p>Of the vast empire conquered by Alexander the Great many states were formed, one of which comprised <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and other countries to the east and west of it. This realm fell to the lot of one of the conqueror's generals, Seleucus Nicator, or Seleucus I, founder of the dynasty of the <a href="../cathen/13690a.htm">Seleucid&aelig;</a>. About the year 300 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> he founded a city on the banks of the lower Orontes, some twenty miles from the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> coast, and a short distance below Antigonia, the capital of his defeated rival Antigonus. The city, which was named Antioch, from Antiochus, the father of Seleucus, was meant to be the capital of the new realm. It was situated on the northern slope of Mount Silpius, on an agreeable and well-chosen site, and stretched as far as the Orontes, which there flows from east to west. It grew soon to large proportions; new quarters or suburbs were added to it, so that ultimately it consisted of four towns enclosed by as many distinct walls and by a common rampart, which with the citadel reached to the summit of Mount Silpius. When <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> was made a Roman province by Pompey (64 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), Antioch continued to be the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of the East. It also became the residence of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, or governors, of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. In fact, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, after <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Alexandria, was the largest city of the empire, with a population of over half a million. Whenever the emperors came to the East they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> it with their presence. The <a href="../cathen/13690a.htm">Seleucid&aelig;</a> as well as the Roman rulers vied with one another in adorning and enriching the city with <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, theatres, <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>, aqueducts, public baths, gardens, fountains, and cascades; a broad avenue with four rows of columns, forming covered porticoes on each side, traversed the city from east to west, to the length of several miles. Its most attractive pleasure resort was the beautiful grove of laurels and cypresses called Daphne, some four or five miles to the west of the city. It was renowned for its park-like appearance, for its magnificent temple of Apollo, and for the pompous religious festival held in the month of August. From it Antioch was sometimes surnamed Epidaphnes. The population included a great variety of races. There were Macedonians and Greeks, native Syrians and Ph&aelig;necians, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Romans, besides a contingent from further <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>; many flocked there because Seleucus had given to all the right of citizenship. Nevertheless, it remained always predominantly a Greek city. The inhabitants did not enjoy a great <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for learning or virtue; they were excessively devoted to pleasure, and universally known for their witticisms and sarcasm. Not a few of their peculiar traits have reached us through the sermons of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, the letters of Libanius, the "Misopogon" of Julian, and other literary sources. Their loyalty to imperial authority could not always be depended upon. In spite of these defects there was at all times in Antioch a certain number of men, especially in the Jewish colony, who were given to serious thoughts, even to thoughts of religion. After the fifth century Antioch lost much of its size and importance. It was visited by frequent earthquakes, by not less than ten from the second century <font size=-2>B.C.</font> to the end of the sixth century of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> era. Twice it was captured and sacked by the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, in <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 260 and 540. On the latter occasion it was almost completely destroyed, but was rebuilt by the Emperor Justinian I (527-565) on a much smaller scale, and called Theopolis. It is said that no small portion of his walls remained until 1825, a specimen of the military architecture of the sixth century. In 638 it was taken by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, was restored to the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a> in 969, and reconquered by the Seljuks in 1084. From 1098 until 1268 it was in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a> and their descendants; the Sultan Bibars of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> took it in 1268; and in 1517 it came with <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> under the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Empire. The former populous <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of the East is now the small town of Antakia with about 20,000 inhabitants (see <a href="../cathen/01283b.htm">A<font size=-2>LEPPO</font></a>).
<h2 id="section2">Christianity of Antioch</h2>

<p>Since the city of Antioch was a great centre of government and civilization, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> spread thither almost from the beginning. Nicolas, one of the seven <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, was from Antioch (<a href="../bible/act006.htm#vrs5">Acts 6:5</a>). The seed of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> teaching was carried to Antioch by some disciples from <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> and Cyrene, who fled from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> that followed upon the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/14286b.htm">St. Stephen</a> (<a href="../bible/act011.htm#vrs19">Acts 11:19-20</a>). They preached the teachings of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, not only to the Jewish colony but also to the Greeks or <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and soon large numbers were converted. The mother-church of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> having heard of the occurrence sent Barnabas thither, who called Saul from <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a> to Antioch (<a href="../bible/act011.htm">Acts 11:22-25</a>). There they laboured for a whole year with such success that the followers of Christ were acknowledged as forming a distinct community, "so that at Antioch the disciples were first named <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>" (ib., 26). Their charity was exhibited by the offerings sent to the famine-stricken brethren in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>. <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a> himself came to Antioch (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs11">Galatians 2:11</a>), probably about the year 44, and according to all appearances lived there for some time. The community of Antioch, being composed in part of Greeks or <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, had views of its own on the character and conditions of the new religion. There was a faction among the disciples in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> which maintained that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> converts to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> should pass first through <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> by submitting to the observances of the Mosaic law, such as <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and the like. This attitude seemed to close the gates to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and was strongly contested by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Antioch. Their plea for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> liberty was defended by their leaders, Paul and Barnabas, and received full recognition in the Apostolic Council of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs22">Acts 15:22-32</a>). Later on <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> defends this principle at Antioch even in the face of Peter (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs11">Galatians 2:11</a>). Antioch became soon a centre of missionary propaganda. It was thence that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and his companions started on their journey for the conversion of the nations. The Church of Antioch was also fully organized almost from the beginning. It was one of the few original churches which preserved complete the catalogue of its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The first of these <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Evodius, reaches back to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> age. At a very early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community of Antioch became the central point of all the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> interests in the East. After the fall of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (<font size=-2>A.D.</font> 70) it was the real <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in those countries.



<p>In the meantime the number of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> grew to such an extent, that in the first part of the fourth century Antioch was looked upon as practically a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> city. Many churches were erected there for the accommodation of the worshippers of Christ. In the fourth century there was still a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> called "the ancient" and "apostolic". It was probably one of the oldest <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> monuments of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>; an ancient tradition maintained that it was originally the house of Theophilus, the friend of St. Luke (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs1">Acts 1:1</a>). There were also sanctuaries dedicated to the memory of the great Apostles, Peter, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and John. Saint Augustine speaks (Sermo, ccc., n. 5) of a "basilica of the holy Machabees" at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, a famous shrine from the fourth to the sixth century (Card. Rampolla, in "Bessarione", Rome, 1897-98, I-II). Among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> dedicated to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> uses was the celebrated Temple of Fortune (Tych&aelig;ion). In it the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Antioch enshrined the body of their great <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Ignatius. There was also a <em>martyrium</em> or memorial shrine of Babylas, a third-century <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Antioch, who suffered death in the reign of <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a>. For the development of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> domestic architecture in the vicinity of the great city see De Vogu&eacute;, "Architecture civile et religieuse de la Syrie Centrale" (Paris, 1867-77), and the similar work of Howard Crosby Butler (New York, 1903). The very important monastic architecture of the vicinity will be described under <a href="../cathen/13795a.htm">S<font size=-2>IMEON</font> S<font size=-2>TYLITES</font></a> and <a href="../cathen/03094a.htm">B<font size=-2>YZANTINE</font> A<font size=-2>RCHITECTURE</font></a>. The <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> (306-337) built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> there, which he adorned so richly that it was the admiration of all contemporaries (St. John Chrys., "Hom. in Ep. ad Eph.", X, 2; Eus., <a href="../fathers/25023.htm"><em>Life of Constantine</em> III.50</a>, and "De laud. Const.", c. 9). It was completely pillaged, but not destroyed, by Chosroes in 540. The Church of Antioch showed itself worthy of being the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in the east. In the ages of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> it furnished a very large quota of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> setting the example. It may suffice to mention <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">St. Ignatius</a> at the beginning of the second century; Asclepiades under <a href="../cathen/13721a.htm">Septimius Severus</a> (193-211); and Babylas under <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a> (249-251). It produced also a number of great men, who either in writing or otherwise distinguished themselves in the service of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The letters of the afore-mentioned St. Ignatius are very famous. <a href="../cathen/14625a.htm">Theophilus</a> wrote in the latter part of the second century an elaborate defense and explanation of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. In later ages there were such men as <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a>, who did much to reunite the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Antioch divided by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> disputes; <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantinople, and Theodoret, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cyrus in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. Several <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> took their rise in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. In the third century <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, professed <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> doctrines. <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> had its original root not in Alexandria but in the great <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> city, Antioch; <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> sprang from it through <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a> and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> of Constantinople. A peculiar feature of Antiochene life was the frequency of conflict between the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; several grievous seditions and massacres are noted by the historians from the end of the fourth to the beginning of the seventh century (Leclercq, Dict. d'arch. et de liturg. chr&eacute;t., I, col 2396).
<h2 id="section3">Patriarchate of Antioch</h2>

<p>When the early organization of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was developed, the Church of Antioch, owing to its origin and influence, could not fail to become a centre of special higher <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Traces of this power were seen in the very first ages. Towards the end of the second century <a href="../cathen/13726d.htm">Serapion, Bishop of Antioch</a> gave instructions on the Apocryphal Gospel of St. Peter to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Rhossus, a town not of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> but of Cilicia. Tradition has it that the same Serapion <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, which was then outside of the Roman Empire. The councils held about the middle of the third century in Antioch called together <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Palestine, <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, and the provinces of Eastern <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a> spoke of these <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as forming the episcopate of the Orient, among whose members Demetrian of Antioch was mentioned in the first place. At the Council of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a> (314) presided over by Bishop Vitalis of Antioch, about the same countries were represented through the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the principal cities. In general, the Churches in the "East", as this complexus of Roman provinces was known (cf. Oriens Christianus), gravitated towards the Church of Antioch, whose <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from remote antiquity exercised a certain <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over them. This custom was sanctioned by the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> (325). The Fathers of this assembly decreed in the sixth canon that the privileges of the Church of Antioch should be maintained. According to the second canon of the Council of Constantinople (381) the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> comprised, and was restricted to the civil diocese of the Orient which included all the eastern-most provinces of the Roman Empire. In the Council of Ephesus (431) the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> were declared independent of Antioch; and in that of Chalcedon (451) the three provinces of Palestine were detached from Antioch and placed under the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (see <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">C<font size=-2>YPRUS</font></a>). From the foregoing it is evident that, while in the early ages the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Antioch extended over the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities in the countries outside the Roman Empire, its proper limits were <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Palestine, and Eastern <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. Gradually it was so restricted that by the middle of the fifth century it was confined to the northern part of the civil diocese of the Orient and the countries outside of the Roman Empire. The title given to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> on account of this higher <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> was that of "Partriarch", which he held in common with other dignitaries of a similar rank. His <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> could be exercised not only with regard to the faithful within his territory, but also over the ordinary and the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. It seems worthy of mention here that early in the fourth century, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> possessed at Antioch both urban and rural properties, both in the old and the "new" parts of the city, and even in the Jewish quarter. (<a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">Liber Pontificalis</a> ed. Duchesne, I, 177, 195; cf. cxlix sq.) The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> of Antioch lost much of its importance after the middle of the fifth century owing to many adverse circumstances. The Bishops of Constantinople, who aspired to the first rank in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, acquired gradually, and long maintained, a controlling influence over the Church of Antioch. In the latter part of the fifth century the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, under Peter Fullo, endeavoured to take possession of the patriarchal see. After the death of their leader Severus (539) they elected their own <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of Antioch. During the centuries that followed the conquest of Antioch by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> (638), the succession of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> incumbents of the patriarchal see was irregular; and they had to suffer much from the new conquerors of the city, who showed a marked preference for the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> (see <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">M<font size=-2>OHAMMEDANISM</font></a>). When the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek schism</a> was consummated in the eleventh century, the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> of Antioch, owing to traditional Byzantine influence, was drawn into it, and remained <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> despite repeated efforts of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> for a reunion. At present the Greek patriarch resides in <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, the city of Antioch having long since lost all political importance. It was not only the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> who dismembered thus early the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> of Antioch. The <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> who <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> into <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> after their condemnation at Ephesus (431) soon became so strong that at the end of the fifth century their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Bab&aelig;us of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a>, made himself independent of Antioch, and established a new <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> with its centre in Seleucia, afterwards in <a href="../cathen/02202c.htm">Bagdad</a>. Those Syrians who remained united with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (now known as the Chald&aelig;ans) continued to acknowledge a patriarch of their own. He is called <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a> and lives in Mosul. Among the other oriental communities united with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> there are three which have all their <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of Antioch, viz. the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Syrians (see <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">G<font size=-2>REEK</font> C<font size=-2>HURCH</font>, U<font size=-2>NIAT</font></a>).
<h2 id="section4">Latin patriarchate of Antioch</h2>

<p>When the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> took possession of Antioch in 1098, they reinstated at first the Greek patriarch, then John IV. About two years afterwards the said dignitary found that he was unfitted to rule over <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Christians</a>, and withdrew to Constantinople. Thereupon the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Christians</a> elected (1100) a patriarch of their own, an ecclesiastic by the name of Bernard who had come to the Orient with the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>. From that time Antioch had its Latin <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, until in 1268 Christian, the last incumbent, was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by the Sultan Bibars, during the conquest of the city. The Greeks also continued to choose their <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of Antioch, but these lived generally in Constantinople. The <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Latin <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> in Antioch extended over the three <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> principalities of Antioch, <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15060a.htm">Tripolis</a>. Towards the end of the twelfth century the island of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> was added. In practice they were far more dependent upon the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> than their predecessors, the Greek <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>. After the fall of Antioch (1268) the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> still appointed <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, who, however, were unable to take possession of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Since the middle of the fourteenth century they have been only titular dignitaries. The title of Latin <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> is yet conferred; but the recipient resides in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and is a member of the chapter of the basilica of St. Mary Major.
<h2 id="section5">Synods of Antioch</h2>

<p>Owing to the special position of Antioch many <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were held there. A <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, that some find expressed for the first time by <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Pope Innocent I</a> (407-417; <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, Conc., III, 1055) but that others locate about 787 (<a href="../cathen/07251c.htm">Herder</a>, K. L., I, 112), was current in the past that the Apostles held a council in Antioch (see <a href="../cathen/03279a.htm">C<font size=-2>ANONS,</font> A<font size=-2>POSTOLIC</font></a>). We are informed by this text (Pitra, Jur. Eccl. Gr. Hist., I, 90-93) that the name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> was formally assigned to the followers of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, and that special instructions were given to the Apostolic missionaries and to their converts. These canons, according to <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Cardinal Hergenr&ouml;ther</a> (<a href="../cathen/07251c.htm">Herder</a>, K. L., l. c.), are <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>, "a mere compilation from the data of the (canonical) Acts and from other writers". About the year 251 a council was held, or planned to be held, at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, on the subject of <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatianism</a> to which Fabius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, was inclined. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> chiefly interested in it, apart from Fabius, were Helenus of <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>, Firmilian of C&aelig;sarea in Cappadocia, and Theocritus of C&aelig;sarea in Palestine, who invited also <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a>. The matter had no further consequence, since Fabius died shortly afterwards and was succeeded by Demetrian, whose views on the reconciliation of the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> were less extreme. Between the years 264 and 268 three different <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were held on account of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> doctrines on the nature of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> and His relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, attributed to Paul, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and a native of <a href="../cathen/13422a.htm">Samosata</a>. Bishops from <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Palestine, <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, Cilicia, Cappadocia, <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, and Lycaonia took part in these deliberations. Finally, in the third synod, they deposed Paul, convicted him of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and elected Domnus in his place. Under the protection of the Princess Zenobia of <a href="../cathen/11433a.htm">Palmyra</a>, Paul was able to maintain himself for some time. He was expelled in the end (272) by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02108b.htm">Emperor Aurelian</a> (270-275).

<p>Most of the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> held during the fourth century reflected the struggles that followed upon the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> controversy. The council of 330 deposed the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Eustathius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>; and for a long time the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was in possession of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. In the council held in 340 <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> was deposed, and a certain Gregory, from Cappadocia, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in his stead. The intruder could take possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> only under a military escort. The deposition of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> was ratified in the synod of the following year (341), which was held on the occasion of the dedication of the "great", or "golden" church mentioned above as built by Constantine. The twenty-five disciplinary canons passed by this council were afterwards received by the universal <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The four creeds adopted, though not <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, still depart from the symbol of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> made at Nic&aelig;a. Several other <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were held in quick succession. In that of 344 the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Stephen of Antioch, was deposed for misconduct. In the symbol of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> adopted by this council the <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arian</a> views found expression; at the same time it was directed against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, the Sabellians, but also against St. Athanasius. The <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of 358, 361, and 362 revealed and asserted the predominance of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. The Bishop Eudoxius condemned both the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arian</a> views. A new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was elected in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Meletius, who was thought by many to be on the side of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> proclaimed their loyalty to the party in spite of defections. At the accession of the Emperor Jovian (363) a council was held in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, at which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> agreed to the Nicene <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, though they added at the end a <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arian</a> declaration. At last, in 368, a large number of Oriental <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, assembled in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, broke with <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> altogether. They gave their assent to the Nicene <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as it had been expressed by <a href="../cathen/04613a.htm">Pope Damasus</a> and a Roman synod in 369; viz., that the Father and Son, and Holy Ghost were one substance. The <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held in 388 forbade any revenge for the death of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> killed by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>; another <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held in 390 condemned the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10212a.htm">Messalians</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of the fifth and sixth centuries were usually concerned with the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> controversies of the time. Thus the council of 424 decreed the expulsion of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> from the city. Phases of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> and <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> controversies were dealt with in the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of 432, 447, 451, 471, 478, 481, 482, 508, 512, 565. A synod of the year 445 rendered a decision in the matter of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Perrha, accused of misconduct and brought before the patriarch of Antioch. Finally, a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held about the year 542 was <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenistic</a> controversies in Palestine. During the period of Latin domination two <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were held at Antioch. In 1139 Radulf, the second Latin <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, was deposed for having aspired to complete independence from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and for cruel treatment inflicted on some <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. In 1204 the Cardinal-Legate Peter decided certain claims on the principality of Antioch in favour of the Count of <a href="../cathen/15060a.htm">Tripolis</a>, against <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, which was placed under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>. Ecclesiastical life in Antioch became all but extinct from the time that the city was permanently taken by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>.
