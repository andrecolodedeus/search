<h1>The Counter-Reformation</h1>  

<p>The subject will be considered under the following heads:<blockquote><p>I. Significance of the term <br>II. Low ebb of Catholic fortunes <br>III. St. Ignatius and the Jesuits, pioneers of the new movement <br>IV. The Council of Trent <br>V. Three great reforming popes <br>VI. The missions <br>VII. Progress in European States <br>VIII.

<h2 id="section1">Significance of the term</h2>

<p>The term <em>Counter-Reformation</em> denotes the period of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> revival from the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pope Pius IV</a> in 1560 to the close of the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a>, 1648. The name, though long in use among <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> historians, has only recently been introduced into <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> handbooks. The consequence is that it already has a meaning and an application, for which a word with a different nuance should perhaps have been chosen. For in the first place the name suggests that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> movement came after the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>; whereas in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the reform originally began in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> was a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Reformer before he became a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. By becoming a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant Reformer</a>, he did indeed hinder the progress of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> reformation, but he did not stop it. It continued to gain headway in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> South until it was strong enough to meet and roll back the movement from the North. Even if our <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> reform had been altogether posterior to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, we could not admit that our reform movement owed its motive power or its line of action to the latter, in the way that modern reform movements among Orientals are due to the influence of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> thought. For the principles of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant Reformation</a> are to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> principles leading to deformation and to the perpetuation of abuses, such as the subservience of Church to State, or the marriage of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, to say nothing of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Both the continuance and correction of the same abuse cannot be due to the same movement. Moreover, it will be seen that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> reform was not even originally due to reaction from <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, in the way In which inert nations are sometimes spurred by initial defeats to increased energy, which In the end may even make them victorious. Though this reaction undoubtedly had its effect on certain <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> reformers, it had little or no influence on the leaders or on the best representatives of the movement, as, for instance, on St. Ignatius, its pioneer, or on <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a> and <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, exemplars of its maturity.

<p>Another point to be noticed is that, though we assign certain dates for the beginning and end of the period under consideration, there has never been any break in the striving of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> which arose in the sixteenth century. In this sense the Counter-Reformation began in the time of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and is not even yet closed. But while the points of similarity between this period and those which preceded and followed it might be dwelt upon at some length, and must occasionally be called to mind, there is no reason for rejecting the term, or for denying that it corresponds with a real and important historical period. Historical periods, it will be remembered, are never sharply cut off, during the actual course of events, from what goes before and comes after, as they are described in books; for history in the concrete is always continuous. In this case the limits of the period are to be measured not by reversals of reforming policy and methods, but by the increased or decreased energy with which such reformation is pursued. When there is intense <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> on the part of many for making reforms, then is the "period" of reform. Similarly this "period" ceases when such <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> becomes rare, or only mediocre in intensity, even though it does really continue here and there in some <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> or classes. It would be a misrepresentation of the heroes of the Counter-Reformation to describe their reforms as having differed from those of the older opponents of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, except in degree, in earnestness, thoroughness, adaptability to altered circumstances, etc. Their predecessors had been clear in the condemnation and punishment of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. They had preached, pleaded, threatened, even fought, but they did not remodel their ways seriously everywhere, in small things and in great. They did not institute new and vast schemes of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, or alter the constitutions of their States. They did not succeed in awakening the enthusiasm of their party, or in encouraging whole classes to make heroic <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, or heroic efforts. But there did come a time when there was such heroism on a large scale, when whole classes, as for instance episcopates, new <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, and even the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> (as in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> during the persecutions), were filled with enthusiasm; when <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were numerous; when great writers, preachers, and leaders abounded; when <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was attended to from the highest motives and with the greatest interest; when the old <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of life were discharged with an alertness, a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, a meaning which were new; when for a time <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rulers and whole States rose superior to considerations of self-interest.

<p>The span of time during which this enthusiasm lasted may be justly considered as an historical period, and it is that which we call the period of the Counter-Reformation. It may also be well to note at the outset that this period is the harder to follow, not only because of its continuity with previous and succeeding periods, but also because it did not commence or end at the same time in any two countries, and in each land began, grew strong, and died away, through different causes, in different ways and degrees, and at different times. Broadly considered, however, the dates assigned above will be shown to be perfectly accurate.
<h2 id="section2">Low ebb of Catholic fortunes</h2>

<p>"From the time of St. Peter there has not been a pontificate so unfortunate as mine. How I regret the past! <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Pray</a> for me." Such were the sad words of <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Pope Paul IV</a> to Father Laynez, as he lay dying in August, 1559 (Oliver Manare, Commentarius de rebus Soc. Jesu, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 1886, 125). It never looks darker, it is said, than just before dawn; the prospects of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> at that moment did indeed seem gloomy to the watchers in the Vatican. Luigi Mocenigo, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> ambassador at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, sent thence to the seignory this report on the situation:

<blockquote><p>In many countries, obedience to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has almost ceased, and matters are becoming so critical that, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not interfere, they will soon be desperate . . . <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> . . . leaves little hope of being cured. <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> is in almost as hopeless a state. The disorders which have just lately taken place in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> are too well known for me to speak of them, and the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> . . . after returning a short time since to her old obedience, has again fallen into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Thus the spiritual power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is so straitened that the only remedy is a council summoned by the common consent of all princes. Unless this reduces the affairs of religion to order, a grave calamity is to be feared.</p></blockquote>



<p>Another <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> diplomatist (and these men were reckoned among the most acute of their day) wrote not long after, that <a href="../cathen/10575a.htm">Cardinal Morone</a>, when leaving for the council, told him that "there was no hope" (Alb&eacute;ri, Relazioni degli ambasciatori Veneti, 1859, II, iv, 22, 82). Though Morone's prophecy was soon falsified the events about to be described, his words must be considered as conclusive <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that even the bravest and best-informed in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> regarded the situation with profound discouragement, and it will be worth while to seek an explanation by going back to Mocenigo's words. At the same time, without attempting an account of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> itself, notice may be taken of what had hitherto been done in order to stem the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">religious revolution</a>.
<h3>Germany</h3>

<p>Even before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant Reformation</a> the holding of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> and provincial councils had been frequent, and they had always been attentive to points requiring reform. After it, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> had sent thither a succession of <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> and <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a>, such as Aleander, <a href="../cathen/03223a.htm">Campeggio</a>, Cajetan, <a href="../cathen/04323c.htm">Contarini</a>, Morone, who had upon the whole been men of conspicuous sincerity, vigour, and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. There had also been found among the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> many men of splendid eloquence and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, of holy life and ceaseless labour, such as <a href="../cathen/14539a.htm">Tetzel</a>, <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Johann von Eck</a>, <a href="../cathen/10318b.htm">Miltitz</a>, <a href="../cathen/10719a.htm">Nausea</a>, <a href="../cathen/05410a.htm">Jerome Emser</a>, <a href="../cathen/11787a.htm">Julius Pflug</a>, <a href="../cathen/07036b.htm">Johann Gropper</a>, who had striven <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageously</a> and most effectively on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> side. The <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a> had laboured upon the whole with marked devotion in favour of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, though his Italian policy, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, had frequently been repugnant to the wishes and the interests of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiffs</a>. But now he was gone, and his successors, <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II of Spain</a> and Ferdinand of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, whether their energy and devotion or the power which they wielded be considered, were far inferior to him as champions and protectors of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. There had, of course, been some, indeed many, improvements on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> side. The German episcopate, once so worthless, now numbered many noble characters, of whom Otto von Truchsess, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> and afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, was the most brilliant representative. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> had showed from the first to advantage; always ready to meet the foe, they everywhere encouraged and strengthened the men of their own side, and prevented many defections (see N. Paulus, Die deutschen Dominikaner im Kampf gegen Luther, 1903). The first <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> too had won many notable successes. Thus while on the one hand it was evident that there was still life in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, while there was no intrinsic impossibility in carrying further the good that had begun, on the whole the outlook was as dark as the retrospect. No bulwark against <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> had yet been found. Attempts to conclude a "religious peace" or an "Interim", at the various diets of <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, and Augsburg seemed to effect nothing better than to give the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> breathing time for fresh organization, and so prepare the way for new attacks and victories. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> were pressing on <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> from the south-east; the French, allying themselves with the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, had invaded the German West, and had annexed the "three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>" Metz, <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>, and Toul. Charles had then made large <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to get the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> to agree to "the religious peace of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>" (1555), in order to combine all forces against <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The alliance was made, but was unsuccessful; the French retained their conquests; Charles retreated; the power of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> seemed to be under an eclipse. Mocenigo might well say that "Germany leaves little hope of being cured".
<h3>Poland</h3>

<p>"Poland is in almost as hopeless a state." <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> had latterly gained ground rapidly. In 1555 a "national synod" had been held, which had requested the marriage of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, Communion under both kinds, Mass in Polish, the abolishment of "annates". Such demands had but too often <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the forerunners of a lapse to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, and in fact in 1557 the weak King Sigismund Augustus had allowed "liberty" of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> in Danzig and some other towns. There were waverers even among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, like James Uchanski, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> and <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> in 1562. Fortunately the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> was not yet deeply rooted in the country. There had been no sweeping confiscations of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, nor apostasies among the actual rulers. The great <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, <a href="../cathen/07473a.htm">Stanislas Hosius</a>, was rising to fame, and behind him stood a number of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, who would in due time renew the face of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; Still for the moment the state of the country was very serious. (See Krause, <em>Die Reformation und Gegenreform. im ehemaligen K&ouml;nigreiche Polen</em>, Posen, 1901.)
<h3>France and Spain</h3>

<p>"The disorders in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> are too well known for me to speak of them." The first open revolt of the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>, styled the <em>Tumulte d'Amboise</em>, had taken place just before Mocenigo wrote. Hitherto, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> though allying herself with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, had preserved her own religious peace. But the converts to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> were numerous and well organized, and counted not a few of the highest nobility and of the blood royal, especially princes of the House of Bourbon, to which the crown was destined to fall ere very long. The ruling sovereign, Francis II, was but a boy, and though for the moment the House of Lorraine and the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Guises</a> brought victory to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, the position was one of evident danger, and was soon to result in a long series of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of religion.

<p>The troubles of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> were in a sense rather foreign than domestic. It was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that there had been some defections, as Enzinas (Dryander), Servetus, and Valdez. Though not numerous, these had been sufficient to cause much alarm and suspicion, so much so that the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo himself, <a href="../cathen/03376a.htm">Bartolom&eacute; Carranza</a> was put on his trial. (Cf. Sch&auml;fer, "Gesch. des spanischen Protestantismus", G&uuml;tersloh, 1902; Men&eacute;ndez y Pelayo, "Historia de los heterodoxos Espa&ntilde;oles", <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 1880-82.) The proceedings lasted a long term of years, but in the end nothing could be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> against him. There was also danger from the Moriscoes. But what gave most cause for anxiety to serious thinkers was the linking of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and so many parts of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>. The latter were everywhere unpopular, and the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> were beginning, especially in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, to pose as patriots, with results very unfortunate for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. For instance, King Philip had arranged with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in 1569 for certain changes in the <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, and Utrecht were made archbishoprics, and fourteen smaller districts were formed into <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>. This measure, wise and commendable in itself, was badly received when it came from Spanish rulers. The redistribution of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, which had to be made in order to endow the new sees, caused complaints which grew constantly louder, and in the end <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> one of the chief causes of the revolt of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>.
<h3>England</h3>

<p>Of all the countries of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> none changed sides with such appalling facility as <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. At first she had seemed the least likely of any to revolt. She had been peaceful and contented; the observance of the canons compared favourably with that in many other countries; her king was emphatically on the side of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, until "the Gospel light first shined in Boleyn's eyes". Then it was found that the absolute power of the sovereign was easily greater than any other force in the realm. There were some glorious <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> (see <a href="../cathen/08462b.htm">FISHER</a>; <a href="../cathen/08465a.htm">HOUGHTON</a>; <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">MORE</a>) and, in general, sufficient resistance to show that the country, as a whole, clung to its old <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and would never have changed but for force. When that force was applied, the change was shamefully rapid and complete. When <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a> gained the upper hand, there was remarkably little difficulty found in the much more arduous task of restoring the old order, in spite of the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, which had been confiscated, and had already been redistributed into thousands of hands. Only about two years were available for the actual restoration of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and though the work was carried out in a way that was not very conciliating, yet the Marian establishment <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> itself more stable, when tried in the fire of Elizabeth's <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, than the ancient Church when attacked by King Henry. In neither case, however, could the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> withstand the power of the Crown; and again the resistance, though sufficient to be reckoned a magnificent protest against the royal tyranny, was entirely inadequate to hinder the dictates of the Tudor sovereign and her powerful <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>. The Marian reaction movement should not be reckoned under the Counter-Reformation proper, for it was in effect almost entirely a restoration of old methods and old <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, and derived its force from the old religious feelings of the land. These had lain dormant while beaten down by overwhelming force, but rose again as soon as that repression ceased.
<h3>Scotland and Ireland</h3>

<p>These countries were probably included by Mocenigo under <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, though their condition was in reality widely different. <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, unlike <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, was perhaps of all countries in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> the most likely to take up the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Bloody and incessant feuds had sadly demoralized monastic life, and rendered church government extremely difficult, while the rough barons had intruded their <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> children into a large number of the livings, abbacies, and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a>. Yet <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> resisted for a generation the reformation which Henry and Edward strove with all their might to impose upon her. Elizabeth's efforts were more subtle and more successful. Mary of <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Guise</a>, Queen Regent of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, relied almost entirely upon the French arms for the maintenance of royal and religious authority. It was represented to the nobility that this was an insult and an injury to those on whom the government of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> should naturally have fallen, the House of <a href="../cathen/07123a.htm">Hamilton</a> and the nobility of the land. Moreover the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Calvinists in France</a> had won over many young Scottish soldiers and students in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, notably the Earl of Arran who stood but two or three steps from the throne. The revolution took place, and though the regent might have held her own if <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> had been neutral, there could be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the issue when Elizabeth actively supported the rebels with money, men, and ships. The ninth clause of the Treaty of Edinburgh (6 July, 1560) stipulated that "the matter of religion be passed over in silence", which in effect left to the Scottish <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> at their back, absolute power to do what they liked. The estates of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were seized by the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, and (except in the inaccessible North) every vestige of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> observance was forcibly banished from the land. It was the last national revolt from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and was the more lamentable because of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland's</a> previous constancy.

<p>As to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> probably <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing except the darkest features. The <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Marian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and indeed all the Anglo-Irish of the Pale had thrown in their lot with Elizabeth, though she had as yet made few changes. Officially the state of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> seemed as bad as that of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Communication with the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> beyond the Pale was most difficult to keep up; it had probably not yet been opened.
<h3>Scandinavia and Italy</h3>

<p>Mocenigo said nothing of these nations. The former was so far away from Roman influence that the Counter-Reformation never reached it. Of the latter he would surely have given a better account than of any other <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> nation. A couple of generations back, when the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> Renaissance was at its height, it might have been, or at least seemed, otherwise. There was then corruption in high places, as everyone could see, but the miseries of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> had checked the spread of luxury, which had not permeated far down among the people, and better conditions resulted (Cant&ugrave;, Gli eretici d'Italia, Turin, 1865-67). At every papal election better men were chosen, and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a> certainly contained more enlightened reformers than could be found in any other body. Aleander, <a href="../cathen/04323c.htm">Contarini</a>, Morone, <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Pole</a>, Sadolet may be named as good examples of their class. There were many admirable <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> like Gian Matteo Giberti, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>. Moreover, several new and efficient <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders had lately come into existence, the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a>, while <a href="../cathen/08343a.htm">St. Jerome Emiliani</a> had formed the Clerics Regular known as the <a href="../cathen/14140a.htm">Somaschi</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Pope Paul IV</a> (Giovanni Pietro Caraffa) was himself a representative of the best traditions of the Italian Church immediately before the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. He was holy and sincere, business-like and energetic, as he had <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> before his elevation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. But the virtues of a great reformer are not always the virtues most needed in a ruler. Like <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a>, on certain occasions, <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> was sometimes rash in having recourse to <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> methods. His <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> against nepotism was a reform of the utmost importance, yet he was betrayed, in a great measure by nepotism, into the fatal <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (1557-58), the misfortunes and disturbances of which affected the cause of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> so adversely throughout Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Because of this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Mary Tudor's</a> reign closed in gloom, the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> were distracted, intercourse with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was practically intermitted for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> maintained that the evils of the time were due to the <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. As soon as the Peace of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> was concluded, In 1559, the evils which had hitherto been working unperceived became evident. While <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> fell away, followed by <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> were found to be deeply infected by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> had either no representatives in those countries to combat the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or they were so out of favour as to have little or no power. This explains the words of <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> on his death-bed, quoted above, which so vividly describe the unfortunate condition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at this moment.
<h2 id="section3">St. Ignatius and the Jesuits, pioneers of the new movement</h2>

<p>But though <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> did not advert to it, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> reaction had already made considerable progress. The number of great men among the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a>, and other orders, have already been mentioned as symptomatic of the improvement. Then there appeared Ignatius and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, so conspicuous in the new movement. And here it may be well to notice how very different the evolution of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant Reformers</a> (even of those who were most conscientious) was from that of the vocation of this <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> leader. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and many like him began by denouncing abuses. The abuses were serious, no doubt, but from the nature of the case abuses in matters or of matters themselves holy and laudable. Yet so violent did the accusers become that they gradually forgot any good there was connected with the object decried, though the good perhaps in reality far outweighed the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Then came attacks upon the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who maintained or defended the thing impugned, or who failed to make the changes demanded, and they were almost always declared to have virtually or actually betrayed or deserted the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself. Finally the reformer, setting himself up as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> standard of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, fell to self-exaltation, and at last rebelled and separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which he had originally intended to serve.

<p>The soldier, Ignatius, in the enforced leisure after his wound at <a href="../cathen/11437a.htm">Pampeluna</a> (1521) bethought himself of serving Christ as a captain. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> slowly took possession of him and aroused a lofty spiritual <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>. The imitation and service of Christ were to be most thorough. He would first <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educate</a> himself as well as his age would allow, become a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, induce the best of his companions to join him, and then go to the Holy Land and imitate the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour's</a> life as literally and exactly as possible. This was a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> but sublime ideal, capable of appealing to and satisfying the most earnest <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and sure to lead to great efforts. There was no preoccupation here about the reform of abuses, nor indeed any temporal concern whatever, even the most praiseworthy. For twelve years Ignatius, now a middle-aged man, laboured at the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and the sanctification of himself and of the few followers who threw in their lot with him, and the plan would have been completed as it had been conceived, had not <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> kept him and his companions waiting for several months at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, unable to proceed to Palestine. Then he turned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which he reached in November, 1537, and never left again. The services of his small band of companions were soon in great request; they were the "handy men" of the hour, with heads and hearts ready for any work. In a short time they had been heard of and seen everywhere. Though few in number they had carried the Gospel to <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a>, <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, the ends of the known world. They had faced and fought the most redoubted <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; they had preached to the poor and tended the sick in the darkest purlieus of the manufacturing cities. They had not indeed as yet the great colleges which afterwards made them famous, nor did people feel their force as a corporate body, but this only made their position as the pioneers, or advance guard of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the more noteworthy. If so few preachers could do so much, their calls on others to join in the struggle roused multitudes to confidence, energy, and fresh efforts. (<em>See</em> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">SOCIETY OF JESUS</a>.)
<h2 id="section4">The Council of Trent</h2>

<p>The Council had been originally summoned in the year 1537, and sixteen sessions were held during the next fourteen years. In 1552 it was prorogued for the third or fourth time, and so serious were the quarrels throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> that its conclusion was almost despaired of. "The only remedy", said Mocenigo, "is a council summoned by the common consent of all princes." Yet there was small chance that the factious, overbearing princes of those days would give up their own views and interests. Still, for the common good, it had to be attempted, and when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> met again in 1561 they came with hearts resolved to do their utmost. But "the consent of all the princes" was not easy to obtain. If they had known of Elizabeth's secret dealings with the French Court (Foreign Calendars, 1561, nn. 682, 684), they might have put a very <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">sinister</a> interpretation on the proposals with which the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Lorraine and other Gallicans were constantly interrupting the progress of business. At last <a href="../cathen/10575a.htm">Cardinal Morone</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Lorraine paid personal visits to the emperor and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. A better understanding between the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> and the state parties ensued, and so the council was concluded, with much more expedition and satisfaction than had seemed possible. While the politicians had been squabbling, the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> had been doing their work well, and when the decrees came to be <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, there was general admiration at the amount of definition that had been accomplished. Though there had been so many rumours of quarrels and divisions, the points on which all were agreed were surprisingly numerous and formed a striking contrast to the contradictions and feuds among the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, which were becoming ever more conspicuous and bitter. No council that had ever been held had pronounced so clearly nor on so many useful points. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and representatives of various countries had come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> one another as never before, and when they separated they returned to their flocks with a new perception of the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a>, and edified by the sincere <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of her <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. From this time we find that a certain readiness for compromise, and apprehension of change, which was once widespread, has passed away. Though, for instance, many had wished the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> to receive the Chalice, in order to stay further defections, and though the council and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> had allowed it for certain countries, it was now found that the concession was unnecessary, and it was not made use of. The decrees, at least those which regarded <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, were everywhere received with approval. The disciplinary decrees, on the other hand, were not accepted without serious qualifications by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sovereigns. <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> withheld "the privileges of the Spanish Crown"; <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> at first refused them altogether as inconsistent with the Gallican Liberties, a refusal significant of the danger of Regalism which was to beset the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> for generations to come. [Cf. besides the decrees of the council (Rome, 1564, <em>et soep</em>.), the valuable publication of the G&ouml;rres Society, "Concilium Tridentinum, Diariorum, actorum, epistularum, Tractatuum nova collectio", I, "Diariorum pars prima", ed. S. Merkle (Freiburg, 1901), and "Actorum pars prima", ed. S Ehses (Freiburg, 1904).]
<h2 id="section5">Three great reforming popes</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> are as a rule, and from the nature of their position, extremely conservative, but it was characteristic of the Counter-Reformation that after the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> three <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of great reforming energy should be elected in close succession.
<h3 id="A">St. Pius V</h3>

<p>The great achievement of this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was the example which he gave of <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">heroic virtue</a>. In the language of the day, "he made his palace into a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and was himself a model of penance, asceticism, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>". He inspired all about him with his own high views, and new life and strength were soon seen in all parts of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> administration. Many and <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> had been the corruptions which had crept in during the reigns of the easy-going <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> who had preceded him. They had indeed passed severe <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> after the fashion of the time, hoping to maintain good order by occasional severities and the constant dread of heavy penalties, but with lax administration such a method of government produced deplorable results. <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> applied the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> with an unflinching regularity to rich and noble, as well as to mean and poor. His rigour and vigour were sometimes excessive, no doubt, but this would not have seemed very reprehensible in those days. There had been a popular outcry for "reform in the head as well as in the members", but it had seemed hopeless to expect it, considering the strong conservative traditions of the Roman Court. Now that the seemingly unattainable had been accomplished, occasional excesses in the manner of its attainment were easily forgiven, if they were not actually relished, as signs of the thoroughness with which the desired change had been made. Esteem for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> rose, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a> and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> faced with firmness the powerful sovereigns to whom they were sent, and strove with dignity for the correction of abuses. Reforms were more easily accepted by inferiors when superiors had already embraced them. Even <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> mentioned <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pope Pius</a> with respect. <a href="../cathen/02192a.htm">Bacon</a> spoke of "that excellent Pope <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm"><em>Pius Quintus</em></a>, whom I wonder his successors have not declared a saint" ("Of a Holy War", in his Works, ed. of 1838, I, 523; the words however are put into the mouth of another). Though the forces against Pope St. Pius were powerful, and the general position was everywhere so critical that extreme caution might have seemed the best policy, his fearless enforcement of existing church law was on the whole wonderfully successful. Thus, though his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicating</a> and depriving Elizabeth (1670) was in one sense ill-timed and a failure, on the other hand its results in the spiritual sphere were admirable. It broke the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of their subservience to Elizabeth's tyranny over their consciences in a way which no milder measure could have done.
<h3 id="B">Gregory XIII</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> became a leader of the reform movement by virtue of qualities very different from those of his predecessor. He was a kindly, sociable man, who had risen to fame as a lecturer on canon law, and his successes were due to his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and the machinery of government, rather than to anything magnetic or inspiring in his personal influence. He was bountiful in his support of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missions, and in his grants to <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> and colleges. The German, English, and Greek colleges, and many others owe him their foundation <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>, and much of their funds. He sent out missionaries at his own expense to all parts of the world. Though he had no great genius for politics, he had an admirable secretary, Ptolomeo Galli, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of <a href="../cathen/04183a.htm">Como</a>, whose papers remain to this day models of perspicacity and order. Standing nunciatures were now established at <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> courts in lieu of the old special envoys (Vienna, 1581; Cologne, 1584), and with the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiest</a> results. Thus, when Gebhard Truchsess (q.v.) the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, turned <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> and tried (1582) to carry over his electorate with him, the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a> on all sides organized a vigorous counterattack, which was completely successful. Since then Cologne has been a tower of strength to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> of North-Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The reform of the Calendar was another piece of large-minded and far-sighted office work, if it may be so described, which reflected much credit on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> who organized it. <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory</a> was also most generous in granting <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a>, and he encouraged works of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> on a large scale. He took an active part in the celebration of the Holy Year of Jubilee in 1575, and the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, who had flocked in thousands to the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a> returned to spread throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> the satisfaction they had felt at the sight of the good pontiff performing in person the long religious ceremonies, leading processions, or tending poor <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> with his own hands.
<h3 id="C">Sixtus V</h3>

<p>Like <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>, <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> was too much of an enthusiast for abstract theories and <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> practices to be an ideal ruler; he was also a poor financier, and, like many other good lawyers, was somewhat deficient in practical judgment. It was exactly on these points that his successor, <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>, was strong. Where <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory</a>, at the end of his reign, was crippled by <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a> and unable to restrain the bandits, who dominated the country up to the gates of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus</a>, by dint of good management, was soon one of the richest of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, whose word was law in every corner of his States. He finished St. Peter's, and erected the obelisk of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> before it. He built the Vatican Library and that wing of the palace, which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> have inhabited ever since, while he practically rebuilt the Quirinal and Lateran Palaces. He constructed the aqueduct known as the <em>Aqua Felice</em>, the Via Sistina, the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of San Girolamo and other buildings, though his reign only lasted five and a half years. <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus</a> was large-minded, strong, and practical, a man who did not fear to grapple with the greatest problems, and under him the delays (reputed to be perpetual) of the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a> seemed to be changing to briskness, almost precipitation.

<p>As the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> had given <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, just when they most needed it, an irrefragable testimony to the unity and catholicity of their Faith, so these three pontiffs, with their varying excellences, showed that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> possessed all the qualifications which the faithful expected in their leaders, virtues which afterwards repeated themselves (though not quite so often or so frequently) in succeeding <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, especially in <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>. Now at all events, the tide of the Counter-Reformation was running in full flood, and nowhere can its course and strength be better studied than in the missions.
<h2 id="section6">The missions</h2>

<p>While <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, politics and inveterate custom, hampered progress in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, the wide continents of America, <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, and Africa offered a freer outlet for the spiritual energy of the new movement. Beginning with <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, there are among the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> alone quite a multitude of apostles and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, confessors and preachers of the first order. In <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> and <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, Antonio Criminale, Roberto de' Nobili, Ridolfo Acquaviva, <a href="../cathen/13034a.htm">Matteo Ricci</a>, <a href="../cathen/13520a.htm">Adam Schall</a>. In <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, after Padre Valignano's great successes, ensued the terrible <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> in which there perished by heroic death almost eighty <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, to say nothing of others. <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> and the Congo were evangelized by Fathers Nunez, Baretto, and Sylveira. In North America there were heroic struggles to convert the Indians (see <a href="../cathen/02751b.htm">BR&Eacute;BEUF</a>; <a href="../cathen/08752b.htm">LALLEMANT</a>), and in South America, <a href="../cathen/11763a.htm">St. Peter Claver's</a> work for the slaves from <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> and the reductions of <a href="../cathen/11470b.htm">Paraguay</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> were in the field before the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in Central America (where <a href="../cathen/03397a.htm">Las Casas</a> has left an unperishing name); elsewhere also they were soon in the front rank. Later on in the period there are <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> and his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> apostolic followers and (1622) the Roman Congregation <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">"De Propaganda Fide"</a>, with its organized missionaries (see <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">COLLEGE OF PROPAGANDA</a>).

<p>In order to appreciate the connexion of the aforesaid names with the movement under consideration, we must remember that these apostles were not only showing forth in their heroic labours and sufferings the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature of the Counter-Reformation; they were also winning many new converts to it by their preaching, while their letters raised to the highest pitch the enthusiasm of generous <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> at home (see Cros, "St. Fran&ccedil;ois Xavier, Sa vie et Ses lettres", Paris, 1900; also "Lettres Edifiantes et Curieuses", 34 vols., Paris, 1717, sqq.).
<h2 id="section7">Progress in European states</h2>

<p>Whilst in distant lands the new spirit found to some extent a free field, its progress in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> was very largely dependent on the varying fortunes of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> political powers. Here it will only be possible to indicate the chief stages in that progress, and it must be remembered that controversies have arisen at one time or another even about the leading facts.
<h3>Germany and Austria</h3>

<p>Here it is evident that in the first named country the losses of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> did not cease with the Religious Peace of Augsburg in 1555. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, as the occasion arose, had not hesitated to avail themselves of religious troubles in various <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> and had possessed themselves of two archbishoprics (Magdeburg and Bremen), and of 12 important <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>. It was only by recourse to arms that Cologne was saved in 1583; and the freedom of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> and Aachen was in grave danger. There were also many defections among the lesser princes, and so long as Maximilian II (1564-76) was emperor, his <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> proclivities prevented the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from acting with the vigour and authority which became their number and their cause. For the alarming condition of Northern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> about 1600 see "R&ouml;m. Quartalschrift" (1900), p. 385 sqq. So serious did the general position become, that St. Peter Canisius rhetorically compared the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and the Tyrol to the two <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribes</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, which alone were saved while all the others were carried off captive (see O. Braunsberger, Canisii Epistul&aelig; et Acta, Freiburg, 1896-1905, I-IV). Indeed, Albert V of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (1550-79) seemed almost the only <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> prince who could make head against the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. He used his authority freely to exclude <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> from posts of trust, etc., an example afterwards imitated by other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> princes (see Kn&ouml;pfler, Die Kelchbewegung in Bayern unter Albrecht V, Munich, 1901). There was more satisfactory progress among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> themselves. A new generation of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was growing up. Though it was impossible to put an immediate end to the abuses of "patronage" practised by the nobility and the princes, the proportion of men chosen for their capacity and virtues had everywhere increased. Otto von Truchsess, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, has been mentioned, and with him may be classed <a href="../cathen/05271a.htm">Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> (said to have reconciled some 60,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>), Cardinal Klessel, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, Theodore von F&uuml;rstenberg, Ernst von Mengersdorf, Dietrich von Raitenau, of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, and Salzburg respectively, and many others. They were truly "columns of the church", whose influence was felt far beyond the limits of their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Far-reaching, too, were the good results effected by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers, Tanner, <a href="../cathen/07029b.htm">Gretscher (Gretser)</a>, Laymann, <a href="../cathen/04340b.htm">Contzen</a>, and by preachers and missionaries, especially Canisius, called the <em>malleus hoereticorum</em>, and other <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a> also increased steadily and were productive of great and permanent good.

<p>At last with the reign of Rudolph II as emperor (1576-1612) came the occasion for the Counter-Reformation in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Wherever the House of Hapsburg had influence the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> princes and lords began to exercise the same right of reformation (<em>Reformationsrecht, Jus reformandi</em>) in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> had hitherto used against her. But the latter ere long became suspicious. In 1608 they joined in an offensive and defensive "union" which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> answered by their "League". In this way the opposing parties soon drifted into the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> which lasted from 1618 to 1648. Though the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> allies commenced at the greatest disadvantage, they gradually won the upper hand. By the end of 1631 they seemed so secure of their superiority, that Ferdinand II by his "Restitutionsedict" (Edict of Restitution) recalled the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> lands seized by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> since the Religious Peace of Augsburg in 1555, and in particular the aforesaid two archbishoprics and twelve <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>. The political power of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> now stood at the highest point it reached during the Counter-Reformation. But a reaction soon set in; <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and Sweden joined hands with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had neither the enthusiasm nor the unity of purpose to maintain their advantage. The Peace of M&uuml;nster and Osnabr&uuml;ck, in 1648, disastrous and humiliating as it was for <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> politically, was also most injurious to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">TREATY OF WESTPHALIA</a>.) Church lands were freely secularized and distributed, as the price of peace, to lay lords who practically had the right of dictating to their subjects the religion they might profess. The <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authorities</a>, even in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries, claimed and exercised a right of <em>placet</em> in the choice of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, which was in the long run most injurious. Amid the distractions of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, the deceits of victory, and the miseries of defeat, the fervour of the Counter-Reformation had evaporated.
<h3>France</h3>

<p>If the Counter-Reformation had much to fear and to suffer from the politics of secular princes, it was from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> that it had most to dread. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a> had given the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> an occasion for spreading. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> had been the chief difficulty at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the struggle between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> was carried on with great bitterness and cruelty. Though the eventual victory of the Counter-Reformation was very extensive, it was nowhere later in coming; nowhere had there been such danger of a great disaster. This was due to the closeness of the connexion of Church with State. In virtue of the so-called Gallican Liberties (q.v.) the king and nobles exercised undue influence over the appointment of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration in general. But the later rulers of the House of Valois, as also <a href="../cathen/03443a.htm">Catherine de' Medici</a> were miserably wanting in principle, and all efforts at reform under such leaders ended in turmoil and strife. Margaret of Valois, sister of <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>, had favoured <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, and it soon infected the House of Bourbon (Kings of Navarre), into which she had married, and which claimed the succession to the French throne. Henry II had shamelessly allied himself with <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> powers abroad, while he burned <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> at home. Heresy spread among the princes of the blood and the highest nobility, who drew their retainers after them. Hence the numberless quarrels and the seven bloody "Wars of Religion" (1562, 1567, 1569, 1573, 1577, 1580, 1587-93). Both sides were cruel, but the barbarities of the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> were especially revolting to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> feelings. In battle the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were generally victorious, but in the negotiations for peace the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> gained more and more concessions. This was in great measure due to the unprincipled "see-saw" policy of <a href="../cathen/03443a.htm">Catherine de' Medici</a>, who cynically inclined first to one side, then to another. At last Henry III having assassinated the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> leaders of the <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">House of Guise</a>, was himself assassinated and the throne was claimed by <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a>. But as he was a <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenot</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> people of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> would not accept him, and the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> dragged on, with disastrous effects to French power, until Henry IV <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in 1593, and was absolved by <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Pope Clement VIII</a> in 1595. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> recovered with wonderful rapidity on the restoration of peace, and it was now that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> revival began in earnest, reaching its highest point in the following reign.

<p><a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> had laid down four principal conditions for absolving King Henry: <ul><li>the heir to the throne must be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>; <li>a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was to be established in every province in reparation for the numbers which had been destroyed; <li><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship must be introduced even into <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenot</a> towns; <li>the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> must be proclaimed.</ul> The Counter-Reformation in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> may be said to have followed the lines here laid down. Thus: <ul><li>Louis XIII, the son and heir of Henry IV, was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by P&egrave;re Coton, and it was through him that most of the good traditions of the French kings in exercising their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> patronage took shape. He was also remarkable, perhaps almost singular, among the old French kings for the purity of his domestic relations. Thus, though he died comparatively young, and though he was completely eclipsed by his <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> prime minister <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a>, he was no unfit <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to preside over and to protect a movement of religious reform. <li>That reform reached its highest development in the multiplication of religious congregations and orders. In his "M&eacute;moires" <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> says of the reign of Louis XIII, "Le vrai si&egrave;cle de Saint Louis &eacute;tait revenu, qui commen&ccedil;a &agrave; peupler ce royaume de maisons religieuses". The most distinguished founder and director of such congregations was <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, whose religious organizations, beginning in 1617, reached such astonishing extension in the period immediately following. Besides these, there were the foundations or reforms of Saint-Maur (Benedictine); Port-Royal; Brothers of Charity; Congregation of Notre Dame (1607); of the Visitation (1610); the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> (1612); the French Oratory by <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">Cardinal de Berulle</a>. Moreover the <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> developed new provinces, and established many new houses. <a href="../cathen/11767b.htm">St. Peter Fourier</a> founded the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> of St. Saviour. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who had previously had only thirteen colleges, now increased greatly both in numbers and influence, but amid many contradictions and acrimonious controversies with the University and the Parlement of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, however, was effectively supported by the Crown, and at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> the Coll&egrave;ge de Clermont, afterwards Louis-le-Grand, became one of the chief centres of the Counter-Reformation. <li>The re-establishment of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in the districts left under the power of the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> through the Edict of Nantes(1598) proceeded slowly and was attended with difficulty. But the French monarchs had many reasons for exacting obedience from their often insubordinate <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> subjects. Eventually La Rochelle, after a celebrated siege, was reduced by force (1628). Though their quasi-independence was now gone, and with it their political importance, the Counter-Reformation did not lead to the abolition of religious liberty for the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>, which was fully confirmed by the Edict of <a href="../cathen/11083a.htm">N&icirc;mes</a> in 1629. <li>There was much reluctance to admit the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, and an obstinate insistence on the Gallican Liberties which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> eventually a calamity for the French Church.</ul> On the one hand we find great names among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of this period, such as St. Francis of Sales, Cardinals <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">de Berulle</a> and de la Rochefoucauld, Honor&eacute; de Laurens, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Embrun, Philippe de Cosp&eacute;an, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>. Synods were frequent, the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> was much improved. In 1642 St. Vincent of Paul opened the Coll&egrave;ge des Bons Enfants, which served as a model for <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> in many other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>; while <a href="../cathen/11240d.htm">M. Olier</a> between 1642 and 1645 carried into execution his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the Grand S&eacute;minaire of Saint Sulpice. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in general reached so high a level that the period may be regarded as one of the brightest in the history of the Gallican Church. On the other hand the great influence of the State and of the nobility in the selection of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, especially for the highest and most wealthy sees, could not but be injurious. We sometimes hear of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, like the Cardinal de Retz, who were a shame to their order, and still more of worldly <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, like the <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Cardinal Richelieu</a>, who though not proved to be immoral, lowered the ideals of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> devotion to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which had given the Counter-Reformation so much of its first vigour. Other weak points in the progress of the Counter-Reformation in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> may be studied in the careers of Edmond Richer and of the Abb&eacute; of Saint Cyran, <a href="../cathen/05218a.htm">Du Verger de la Hauranne</a>, and in the rise of the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">JANSENISM</a>.)
<h3>Spain and Portugal</h3>

<p>Turning now to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, we see the Counter-Reformation winning here its most signal spiritual victories. There can be no question that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> who flourished at this period, the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, canonists, and spiritual writers whom it <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>, were more remarkable than those produced by any other country, e.g. St. Ignatius, St. Teresa, <a href="../cathen/06213a.htm">St. Francis Borgia</a>, <a href="../cathen/08472c.htm">St. John of God</a>, <a href="../cathen/11770c.htm">St. Peter of Alc&aacute;ntara</a>, <a href="../cathen/08480a.htm">St. John of the Cross</a>, St. Francis of Solano, <a href="../cathen/08469a.htm">John of Avila</a>, Maldonado, Navarro, Salmeron, Toleto, <a href="../cathen/07021b.htm">Gregory of Valencia</a>, Sanchez, Francisco Su&aacute;rez, Juan a Santo Tomaso, <a href="../cathen/13062b.htm">Ripalda</a>, <a href="../cathen/02287b.htm">Barbosa</a>. These form a galaxy of brilliant names, which in their sphere have never been surpassed. The Spanish and Portuguese colonies in South America and the East Indies were also ennobled by missionaries, whose heroism, self-devotion, and energy were beyond compare. Starting from <a href="../cathen/03397a.htm">Las Casas</a>, whose chief achievements, however, belong to an earlier period, mention must be made of the reductions of <a href="../cathen/11470b.htm">Paraguay</a> and the first missions to the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, while the majority of the spiritual labourers in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> were also furnished by the Spanish Peninsula. But here again, as in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, it was in great measure the absolutism of the Crown which prevented the triumph of the new movement from being as complete and permanent as it might have been. A series of second-rate sovereigns, an indifferent bureaucratic government, slavery, and a very bad colonial system, brought on the premature decay not only of the temporal, but also of the spiritual, greatness of these countries. Though the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> was established in several <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> countries, it was more active in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> than elsewhere.
<h3>Italy</h3>

<p>This country had from the first been ready for the Counter-Reformation, and in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> had, as it were, opened the field to reform. Nowhere did the course of the movement progress more uniformly, or last longer. This is best seen in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a> continued to be thoroughly representative of the best talent and virtue in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and where the Sacred Congregations worked with an efficiency and steadfastness never known before. But in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, wherever it is possible to look into the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> life of the nation, a remarkably high level of fervour will be recognized. <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> did not lack followers among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, as the great names of <a href="../cathen/14027a.htm">Sirleto</a>, <a href="../cathen/11419a.htm">Paleotto</a>, Arrigoni, Rusticucci, and many others testify. The detailed accounts that have come down to us of the Jubilees of 1575 and 1600, give us a glimpse of a whole community sensible to, and familiar with, works of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and charity on a very large scale. Among the new congregations of this period mention should be made of the Scolopii, founded in 1600 by St. Joseph of Calasanza (Calasanctius). The most serious set-back was the quarrel of <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> with <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1606 to 1607, and the constant friction with unsympathetic Spanish rulers of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and of the Two Sicilies, about the <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the administration of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>. In the former case the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> may have precipitated the quarrel by the vigour with which he took extreme measures. But when the hostilities had commenced the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> showed an ominous tendency to ally themselves with the Gallicans and even with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. The quarrel, however, only lasted one year. Such men as <a href="../cathen/13477b.htm">Paolo Sarpi</a> and Antonio de Dominis were found but seldom. The "Index Librorum Prohibitorum" of 1564 may appropriately be mentioned here, though it applies to and illustrates all countries.
<h3>England</h3>

<p>Turning now to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> we find the spirit of the Counter-Reformation suddenly bursting into most vigorous life at the preaching of <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Blessed Edmund Campion</a> in 1580. The organization of the mission was due to the magnanimous <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/01322b.htm">Cardinal Allen</a>, whose noble sentiment <em>oportet meliora non ezpectare sed facere</em> (Letters, p. 367) conceived as it was in the face of overwhelming <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, gives us the measure of his lofty spirit. "This Church here", wrote <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Campion</a>, "shall never fail, so long as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> shall be found for the sheep, rage man or <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> never so much." So it fell out. Allen's <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, first at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, then at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, sent forth, year after year, its small quota of missionaries, and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, with the lesser <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, added a few more. It was an heroic struggle, for no <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> can be heavier than that of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> remorselessly applied in a law-loving country. But the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body (numerically small) rose to the occasion, and if there were many failures, as also some serious quarrels and <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a>, there was an astonishingly high average of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and perseverance. In time their worst <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a> died off, and calmer days ensued, but at the close of the period the <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritans</a> were renewing Elizabeth's cruelties, and priests' blood was flowing almost as fast as ever. This same religious enthusiasm manifested itself during the last decade or so of the period, in the foundation of new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, orders, etc., on the Continent. The movement roughly corresponded with the similar movement in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The name of <a href="../cathen/15551c.htm">Mary Ward</a> is one of the most noteworthy in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The mission of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> in spite of home trials is another manifestation of the same spirit.
<h3>Ireland</h3>

<p>During Elizabeth's reign the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> ware almost always engaged in a struggle for life against the ever increasing forces of the English "planters". Sometimes they had their hour of victory, but there never had been time for reform. The process of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> claims about a hundred sufferers in this reign headed by Dermod O'Hurley, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a>. There were also many missionaries of note, the earliest of whom was David Wolfe, S.J., sent by <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pope Pius V</a>; there were also several heroic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> like <a href="../cathen/04469b.htm">Richard Creagh</a> of Armagh, and many notable <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>.

<p>But it was not until the comparative peace under King James that it was possible to fill up the gaps in the episcopate, to found colleges on the Continent, at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Salamanca, <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, etc. (only one or two had commenced earlier), to organize anew the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders (especially the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>). The old life revived in many secluded sanctuaries at home: <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were actually held at Kilkenny, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, and Armagh, and elsewhere literary life was reawakening. (See <a href="../cathen/06163b.htm">FOUR MASTERS</a>; <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">LUKE WADDING</a>.) There were many notable <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> like <a href="../cathen/09336a.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, <a href="../cathen/13207a.htm">David Rothe</a>, etc. Though the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> never wholly ceased (<a href="../cathen/11207a.htm">Bishop Cornelius O'Devany</a>, 1612, and some sixty others were <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> during this period), the Counter-Reformation made great progress, and there were moments when it seemed about to triumph, as, for example, in 1625 and 1641-49. But at the close of the period Cromwell was to blot out with cruelties worse than those of the Tudors all the good that had been accomplished.
<h3>Scotland and Scandinavia</h3>

<p>The Counter-Reformation can hardly be said to have affected <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> and Scandinavia, so complete had been the victory of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. Yet while <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a> reigned in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> there had been renewed signs of life. Fathers de Gouda, Edmund Hay, James Gordon, S.J., <a href="../cathen/09191b.htm">Bishop Leslie</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15659c.htm">Ninian Winzet</a> are the more notable names of this period. Mention must also be made of John Ogilvie, S.J., <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in 1615, and the heroic resistance made by many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> nobles to the tyranny of the Kirk. There was no local <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior or government, the mission depending directly on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> till 1653; but there were some small Scottish colleges for the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, Paris, and <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. In Scandinavia the fall of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> did not come about in a day or a generation &#151; <a href="../cathen/12317a.htm">Father Possevin, S.J.</a>, as also several <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a> strove hard to avert it &#151; but the Counter-Reformation as a movement did not reach any of its peoples.
<h3>The Netherlands</h3>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> every effort was made to exterminate <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">United Provinces</a>, which had revolted from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, contrary to the repeated promises of the Prince of Orange. Still considerable numbers retained their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> &#151; their spiritual needs being cared for by missionaries &#151; though it was impossible to keep up the ancient <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. In <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> the revival ran a more or less uniformly prosperous course. Amongst the great <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and writers of this period were Lindanus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13110a.htm">Roermond</a>, Justus Lipsius, <a href="../cathen/09192a.htm">Leonard Lessius</a>, <a href="../cathen/04377a.htm">Cornelius a Lapide</a>, <a href="../cathen/02380a.htm">Martin Becan</a>, <a href="../cathen/14249b.htm">Thomas Stapleton</a> (an Englishman), etc. But the controversies occasioned by <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a> form a less pleasant episode, and the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> at the end of this period were most injurious. Campaigns and battles ruined the country, and the final terms of peace notably reduced its power.
<h3>Poland</h3>

<p>In this country there was a long struggle between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, which was held by the Crown and the people, and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, which filtered in from the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> countries and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, and was affected by many of the faction-loving nobles and the merchants. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> at last gained the decided upper hand, through the efforts of <a href="../cathen/07473a.htm">Stanislas Hosius</a> and other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, preachers like Scarga, and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a>. King Sigismund II and Wladislaus IV, co-operating with a series of very active and able <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a>, ensured the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> victory; the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, however, still retained much power.
<h2 id="section8">Ecclesiastical literature</h2>

<p>The high spirit of this period manifested itself in literature in many characteristic forms. The age was one of the greatest for <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> the world has ever known. It suffices to recall the names of <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, Francisco Su&aacute;rez, Vasquez, <a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Petavius</a>, and many others who have been alluded to already. More characteristic still were the writers on personal or interior reform, foremost among them St. Ignatius, whose "Spiritual Exercises", for their profound spiritual and practical wisdom, must be placed in a class apart. Similarly distinguished writers were St. Francis of Sales (declared, in 1877, a <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctor of the Church</a>), St. Teresa, Scupoli, Blosius, <a href="../cathen/09385b.htm">Louis of Granada</a>, <a href="../cathen/11240d.htm">M. Olier</a>, Alfonso Rodriguez. The teachings of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were set forth In the admirable catechisms of Canisius (1555-60) and of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (1566). To the same period belong the revised editions of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> (1590-98), the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> (1568), the Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> (1570), the Roman Martyrology (1582), the Corpus Juris Canonici (1582), the Decretum of Gratian (1582). <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Father Campion's</a> "Decem Rationes" (1581) and Father Person's "Christian Directory", exercised an extensive influence, <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> and religious, on contemporary opinion, which was also deeply affected by the religious poems of <a href="../cathen/14463d.htm">Tasso</a> and <a href="../cathen/03156a.htm">Calderon</a>, of <a href="../cathen/14164a.htm">Southwell</a> and <a href="../cathen/04467a.htm">Crashaw</a>. The music of the age also partook in the revival, as is testified by the great name of <a href="../cathen/11421b.htm">Palestrina</a> and the pleasant memories of the exercises of the <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratory of St. Philip Neri</a>.
<h2 id="section9">Close of the period and retrospect</h2>

<p>It has been said before that a period of fervour and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> comes to an end when that <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> dies down to mediocrity in many countries, or among the large majority of people. This had taken place by the year 1648. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the period is generally said to close in 1618, but elsewhere, i.e. in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, the tide of fervour was still flowing in many places, while in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> it was still fairly strong. But this does not prevent our regarding the broad movement as having spent itself. Though the level of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> had risen, the diminution in the number of men of genius was marked. There were but few new foundations; some great missions (Japan, <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a>, the Congo) were given up or in full decline, though others still were growing and flourishing. And the reason was that the interior fervour, the enthusiasm had cooled down. The same thing was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> also about the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. An age of fair mediocrity had taken the place of the fiercely keen ardour of the previous century. In this there was no wonder. It is the ordinary course of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to slacken down after unusual effort, to wax cool after an effervescence of excitement. What was not ordinary, what was on the contrary one of the strangest things in the history of the world, was the display of life and vigour which had been given by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> just when she seemed to be about to fall behind, and to be beaten out of the field by her rivals. Under such circumstances the Counter-Reformation may be regarded as one of the most striking <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the inherent vitality of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which Providence has ever vouchsafed, only to be paralleled by her triumph over the persecutions of the Roman Empire, the invasions of the Barbarians, or the subversive forces of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>.

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">This wide-spreading subject has occasioned an immense literature, no adequate account of which can be given here, though its classifications may be followed by referring to THE CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA, where the various persons and subjects mentioned above are treated in detail. Very few writers, however, have studied the broad but subtle influence of ideas, in virtue of which this revival originated, passed from land to land, grew, flourished and failed. No Catholic writer has described the whole movement with adequate fullness. (1) The best contemporary witnesses were the Roman nuncios, whose special business it was to study these subjects and to report upon them. But few of their papers are however yet published, except those relating to Germany. The reports of the nuncios to Germany (<em>Nunziaturberichte aus Deutschland</em>) are being edited (since 1892) partly by the Prussian and Austrian Historical Institutes at Rome and partly by the G&ouml;rres Gesellschaft; DE HINOJOSA, <em>Los despachos de la diplomacia pontificia en Espana</em> (Madrid, 1896); CAUCHIE, <em>Instructions g&eacute;n&eacute;rales aux nonces de Flandre, 1535-1596</em>; POLLEN, <em>Papal Negotiations with Mary Queen of Scots, 1561-1567</em> (London, 1901); H&Uuml;BNER, <em>Sixte-Quint</em> (Paris, 1870); PASTOR, <em>History of the Popes from the Close of the Middle Ages</em>; JANSSEN, <em>History of the German People</em>, with criticisms of MAURENBRECHER, <em>Gesch. der Kathol. Reformation</em> (1880, only one volume published), and counter criticism by DITTRICH in <em>Jahrbuch der G&ouml;rres Ges</em>., ii, 610. There are several monographs on the details of the progress, first of the Reformation, then of the Counter-Reformation, in particular parts of Germany, e.g. WIEDEMANN, <em>Gesch. der Reformation und Gegenreformation im Lande unter der Enns</em> (5 vols., 1879-86); others by GINDELY (Bohemia) KELLER (Westphalia), LOSERTH (Austria), MAYER (Switzerland), MEYER (Schleswig), etc.; DUHR, <em>Gesch. der Jesuiten in der L&auml;ndern deutscher Zunge</em> (1907); DROYSEN, <em>Gesch. der Gegenreformation</em> (1903, in ONCKEN, <em>Allgemeine Geschichte</em>). French history is the hardest to follow. Consult VICOMTE DE MEAUX, <em>Luttes religieuses en France</em> (Paris, 1879), and <em>La r&eacute;forme et la politique Frac&ccedil;aise en Europe, jusqu' &agrave; la paix de Westphalie</em> (Paris, 1889); PERRENS, <em>L'&eacute;glise et l'&eacute;tat en France sous Henri IV</em> (1873); COUZARD, <em>Une ambassade &agrave; Rome sous Henri IV</em> (1902); PRAT, <em>Recherches sur la C. de J&eacute;sus du temps du P. Coton, 1564-1626</em> (1876); CHENON, <em>La Cour de Rome et la r&eacute;forme cath</em>. in LAVISSE AND RAMBAUD, <em>Histoire G&eacute;n&eacute;rale</em> (Paris, 1897), V. A more objective treatment of the period is to be desired. For the ecclesiastical writers of the period, see HURTER, <em>Nomenclator;</em> SOMMERVOGEL, <em>Bibl. de la c. de J.</em> (1890-1900); HILGERS, <em>Der Index der verbotenen B&uuml;cher</em> (Freiburg, 1904).</p></div>
