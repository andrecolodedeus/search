<h1>The Crosiers</h1>  

<p>(<em>Or</em> Canons Regular of the Holy Cross).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, founded by Th&eacute;odore de Celles, who, after following the <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Emperor Frederick Barbarossa</a> on the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a>, obtained a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/08757a.htm">St. Lambert</a> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>. On the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross (14 Sept., 1211), Th&eacute;odore with four of his fellow-canons pronounced his religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>. Having received from him the church of <a href="../cathen/14567b.htm">St. Theobald</a> at Claire-Lieu, near Huy, de Celles founded there the first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the order. <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a> verbally approved the new order in 1215, and Pope <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> gave his written <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>, which was confirmed by <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> on the feast of the Finding of the Holy Cross (3 May, 1248). The new institution soon extended to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and also to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The Canons of the Holy Cross preached to the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a> with <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a>. Albert, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, took several Crosiers and other <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> with him to Livonia, where a great many of them gained the glory of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> (1246). Some other Fathers accompanied St. Louis on his journey to the Holy Land in 1248. After returning, he enabled them to build the main <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the order in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The Canons of the Holy Cross practise both interior and exterior self-denial, in order to imitate the Savior crucified. Contemplating <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's passion</a> they try to sanctify themselves, and, preaching the mysteries of the Cross, they endeavor to save others, inducing them to follow in the footsteps of the Man of Sorrows.

<p>The order formerly possessed about ninety <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, nineteen of which were in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. These latter were destroyed during the troublesome times of the sixteenth century. The <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> houses were despoiled at the time of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Only two of them were spared. Finally, the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> expelled the Crosiers from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. The two remaining <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> (at St. Agatha and Uden in North Brabant) were likewise doomed to extinction by King William, who ordered them not to admit <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>. His successor, however, retracted this <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> (14 Sept., 1840), and, from that time, the order commenced to flourish again. From these <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> three large branches were founded in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, at Diest (1845); at Maeseyck (1854); at Hannut (1904); while the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Uden has been totally renewed (1905), and the mother-house at St. Agatha restored (1907). In 1857 the master general of the order sent some missionaries to Bay Settlement, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, U. S. A., but the undertaking failed on account of insuperable difficulties. <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Pope Urban VIII</a> gave to the master general, August Neerius, and his successors, the privileges of purple, crosier-staff, <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>, and pontificalia, together with some other exceptional favours (1630). <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Pope Leo X</a> added the special faculty of blessing <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">rosaries</a> or chaplets, so that on a <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">rosary</a> <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgenced</a> by Crosiers 500 days of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> are to be gained each time a Pater or Ave is said. The <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is also applicable to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> (<a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, decrees of 15 Sept., 1842; 13 July, 1845; <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, 9 Jan., 1848). <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pope Pius X</a> decreed that both the Crosier and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a> may be gained together on condition that a whole chaplet is said.

<p>After one year of probation the Crosier <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> enters into the order by a simple but perpetual profession; the solemn profession follows three years thereafter. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the professed <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> wear a white tunic, over which is a black <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a>; a short black mantle (<em>mozetta</em>) and a hood of the same colour complete their costume. Upon the breast of the <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> a cross is sewed, the upright bar of which is red, and the cross-bar white. A prior presides over each <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, and the order is governed by a master general, elected for life, fifty-two having ruled from the foundation to 1908. As their particular patroness the Crosiers venerate <a href="../cathen/11207b.htm">St. Odilia</a>, a companion of <a href="../cathen/15225d.htm">St. Ursula</a>, who is said to have appeared in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to a <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a> of the order, named Jean de Novellan (1387), after which her <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were found at Cologne and brought to the mother-house at Huy. A great many <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> visit the churches of the Crosiers during the octave of <a href="../cathen/11207b.htm">St. Odilia's</a> feast (18 July), in order to obtain her protection, and to be cured from ophthalmy, and water blessed in honor of <a href="../cathen/11207b.htm">St. Odilia</a> is sent on request by the Crosiers all over the world. The life of the Crosier Fathers is both contemplative and active. They give missions, retreats, and assist the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> when asked. They also <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educate</a> young men aspiring to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in their colleges.
