<h2 id="section1">Material objects in liturgical use</h2>
<h3 id="A">The altar cross</h3>

<p>As a permanent adjunct to the altar, the cross or crucifix can hardly be traced farther back than the thirteenth century. The third canon of the Second Council of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> (567), "ut corpus Domini in altario non in imaginario ordine sed sub crucis titulo componatur", which has sometimes been appealed to prove the early existence of an <a href="../cathen/01352a.htm">altar-cross</a>, almost certainly refers to the arrangement of the particles of the Host upon the corporal. They were to be arranged in the form of a cross and not according to any fanciful <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, of the celebrant (see Hefele, Conciliengeschichte). On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> at the beginning of the thirteenth century in his treatise on thee Mass says plainly, "a cross is set upon the altar, in the middle between two candlesticks", but even this probably refers only to the actual duration of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>. From the ninth to the eleventh century the rule is several times repeated: "Let nothing be placed on the altar except a chest with <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> or perhaps the four gospels or a <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a> with the Lord's Body for the viaticum of the sick (cf. Thiers, Sur les principaux autels des &eacute;glises, 129 sqq.). This no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> was understood to exclude even the crucifix from the altar, and it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that in various <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> carvings of the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries no cross is shown. At the same time it should be noted that the <em><a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a></em>, or canopy over the altar, was often surmounted by a plain cross, and also that the <em>coron&aelig;</em>, or ornamental circular frames which were suspended from the inner side of the <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a>, frequently had a cross hanging down in their midst. Some auch coron&aelig; are explicitly referred to in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> during the ninth century. The best-known existing example is the corona of

<p>Recesvinthus now at the Mus&eacute;e de Cluny, Paris, in which the pendent cross is set with large gems. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chronicle just referred to also mentions a silver cross which was erected not over, but close beside, the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of St. Peter's in the time of <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Leo III</a> (795-816): "'There also he made the cross of purest silver, gilded, which stands beside the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>, and which weighs 22 pounds" (Lib. Pont., Leo III, c. lxxxvii). It is probable that when the cross was first introduced as an ornament for the altar it was most commonly plain and without any figure of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Saviour</a>. Such is the cross which a well-known Anglo-Saxon <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> represents King Cnut as presenting to Hyde Abbey, Winchester. But the association of the figure of Christ with the cross was familiar in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> as early as 678, when Benedict Biscop brought a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of the Crucifixion from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Bede, Hist. Abb., &#167;99), and we can hardly <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that a people capable of producing such sculptural work as the stone crosses at Ruthwell and Bewcastle, or the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks'</a> casket, would soon have attempted the same subject in the solid. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> at any rate that a gold crucifix was found in the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/05322a.htm">St. Edward the Confessor</a>, and a crucifix is mentioned in one of the later Lives of <a href="../cathen/05199a.htm">St. Dunstan</a>. That such objects were sometimes used for the altar seems highly probable.

<p>Still, <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> speaks only of a cross, and it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that for several centuries later neither cross nor crucifix were left upon the altar except at Mass time. Even so late as the beginning of the sixteenth century an engraving in the Guinta "Corpus Juris" shows the altar-crucifix being carried in at High Mass by the celebrant, while in many <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> this or some similar custom lasted down to the time of Claude de Vert (Explication, IV, 31). At present the C&aelig;remoniale Episcoporum assumes the permanency of the crucifix on the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>, with its attendant candlesticks [see <a href="../cathen/01352a.htm">ALTAR-CRUCIFIX</a>, under <a href="../cathen/01346a.htm">ALTAR (IN LITURGY)</a>].
<h3 id="B">The processional cross</h3>

<p>When <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> tells us that <a href="../cathen/02081a.htm">St. Augustine of England</a> and his companions came before Ethelbert "carrying a silver cross for a standard" <em>(veniebant crucem pro vexillo ferentes argenteam</em>) while they said the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a>, he probably touched upon the fundamental <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the processional cross. Its use seems to have been general in early times and it is so mentioned in the Roman "Ordines" as to suggest that one belonged to each church. An interesting specimen of the twelfth century still survives in the Cross of Cong, preserved in the museum of the Royal Irish Academy, Dublin. This is made of oak covered with copper plates, but much decoration is added in the form of gold filigreework. It lacks most of the shaft, but is two feet six inches high, and one foot six inches across the arms. In the centre is a boss of rock crystal, which formerly enshrined a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a>, and an inscription tells us that it was made for Turloch O'Conor, King of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> (1123). It seems never to have had any figure of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but other processional crosses of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries are for the most part <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> crucifixes. In a great number of cases the shaft was removable, and the upper portion could be set in a stand to be used as an <a href="../cathen/01352a.htm">altar-cross</a>. Indeed it seems not impossible that this was the actual origin of the <a href="../cathen/01352a.htm">altar-cross</a> employed during Mass (<a href="../cathen/13117b.htm">Rohault de Fleury</a>, La Meese, V, 123-140). Just as the seven candlesticks carried before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were deposited before or behind the altar, and probably developed into the six altar-candlesticks (seven, it will be remembered, when a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> celebrates) with which we are now familiar, so the processional cross seems also to have first been left in a stand near the altar and ultimately to have taken its place upon the altar itself. To this day the ritual books of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> seem to assume that the handle of the processional cross is detachable, for in the funeral of infants it is laid down that the cross is to be carried without its handle. All <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are supposed to be the followers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, hence in procession the crucifix is carried first, with the figure turned in the direction in which the procession is moving.


<h3 id="C">Archiepiscopal and papal cross</h3>

<p>It is not easy to determine with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> at what period the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> cross came into separate use. It was probably at first only an ordinary processional cross. In the tenth "Ordo Romanus" we read of a <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> who is set aside to carry the <em>crux papalis</em>. If this specially <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> cross had been in existence for some time it is likely that it was imitated by <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> and <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> as a mark of dignity which went with the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>. In the twelfth century the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> cross was generally recognized, and in the dispute regarding the primacy between the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and York the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to carry their cross before them played a prominent part. In 1125 Pope Honorius II admonished the Southern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> that they should allow Archbishop Thurstan of York <em>crucem ante se deferre juxta antiquam consuetudiem</em>. In all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in his own province has a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to be preceded by his cross-bearer with cross displayed. Hence an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> when solemnly giving his blessing gives it with head uncovered out of reverence for the cross which is held before him. An ordinary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who is not privileged to have such a cross, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesses</a> the people with his <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> on. As regards form, both the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> cross consists in practice of a simple crucifix mounted upon a staff, the material being silver or silver gilt. The crosses with double and triple bars, which are sometimes termed distinctively <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a>, patriarchal, or <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> crosses, have for the most part only a <a href="../cathen/07243a.htm">heraldic</a> existence (see <a href="../cathen/10525a.htm">Barbier de Montault</a>, La croix &agrave; deux croisillons, 1883). An <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> cross is borne with the figure turned towards the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>.
<h3 id="D">Pectoral crosses</h3>

<p>These objects seem originally to have been little more than costly ornaments upon which much artistic skill was lavished and which usually contained <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. A jewel of this kind which belonged to Queen Theodelinda at the end of the sixth century is still preserved in the treasury of Monza. .Another of much later date, but wrought with wonderful enamels, was found in the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Queen Dagmar and is at <a href="../cathen/04352a.htm">Copenhagen</a>. When the present Queen Alexandra came to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1863 to marry the then Prince of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, she was presented with a facsimile of this jewel containing, among other <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, a fragment of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a>. Such <em>encolpia </em>were probably at first worn by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> not as insignia of rank, but as objects of devotion. For example, a famous and beautiful jewel of this kind was found in the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a> and is now at <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>. When they contained <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> they often came later on to be enclosed in processional crosses. This no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> was the case with the Cross of Cong, mentioned above, upon which we read in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> characters the Latin verse: Hac cruce crux tegitur qua passus conditor orbis.- See Journ. Soc. Antiq. <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, vol. XXXI (1901). As a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> cross, and part of the ordinary episcopal insignia, the <a href="../cathen/11601a.htm">pectoral cross</a> is of quite modern date. No word is said regarding it in the first edition of the <a href="../cathen/03133a.htm">"C&aelig;remoniale Episcoporum"</a> of 1600, but later editions speak of it, and its <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> character is fully recognized by all modern rubricians. It is worn <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at Mass and solemn functions, and also forms part of their ordinary walking-dress. It is usually a plain Latin cross of gold suspended round the neck by a gold chain or a cord of silk and gold. Its use seems gradually to have been introduced during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in imitation of the <a href="../cathen/11601a.htm">pectoral cross</a> which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to have been regularly worn by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> from a much earlier date. Certain <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> (e.g. the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>) are accustomed to wear a cross with two bars or transoms (Anal. Jur. Pont., 1896, 344). The privilege of wearing a <a href="../cathen/11601a.htm">pectoral cross</a> has also been conceded to certain canons.
<h3 id="E">Consecration crosses</h3>

<p>These are the twelve crosses, usually merely <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> on the wall, which mark the places where the church walls have been anointed with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a> in a properly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> church. A candle-bracket should be inserted immediately below. Some of these <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> crosses are even yet distinguishable on the walls of old churches which go back to the Romanesque period. The <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> oratory in Nimeguen preserves, perhaps, the most ancient known example. In other cases e.g. at F&uuml;rstenfeld, some of the old Romanesque candle- brackets also remain. Owing to the number of unctions, it was not infrequently the custom to place these <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> crosses on shields, each borne by one of the twelve Apostles. In the Sainte Chapelle at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, built by St. Louis in the thirteenth century, we find twelve <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of the Apostles carrying discs cases, used for this purpose. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> it was the custom to mark twelve <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> crosses on the outside walls of the church as well as twelve on the inside. The Roman Pontifical only prescribes the latter. (See <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">CONSECRATION</a>.) Salisbury <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> still preserves some remarkable examples of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> crosses. At Ottery St. Mary, Devon, the old crosses are carved in high relief on shields borne by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> within moulded panels, a quatrefoil in a square. Those inside have marks of the remains of iron brackets for candles or a lamp. (See, on English examples, Middleton in "Arch&aelig;ologia", XLVIII, 1885.)
<h3 id="F">Churchyard or monumental crosses</h3>

<p>In the contemporary life of St. Willibald (born c. 700) we have a significant mention of the Anglo-Saxon custom of erecting a cross instead of a church as a rendezvous for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Many ancient stone crosses still surviving in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> are probably witnesses to the practice, and the conjecture of Prof. Baldwin Browne (Arts in Anglo-Saxon <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>), that the cross and graveyard often preceded the church in date, has much to recommend it. Certain it is that the earliest known forms for blessing a cemetery contain five <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> pronounced at the four points of the compass one in the centre, thus forming a cross, while crosses were later on planted in the ground at each of these places. Throughout the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, both in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and on the Continent, there seems always to have been one principal churchyard cross. This was commonly an object of great importance in the <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a> procession when it was saluted with prostrations or genuflexions by the whole assembly. There was also a scattering of boughs and flowers, and the cross was often decorated with garlands or box. For this reason it was often called <em>crux buxata</em> (cf. Gasquet, Parish Life, 1906, pp. 171-4). Many beautiful churchyard crosses are still preserved in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; the most remarkable English examples being perhaps those of Ampney Crucis, near Cirencester, and Bag Enderby, Lincolnshire. The famous ancient Northumbrian crosses at Bewcastle and Ruthwell (which English scholars still assign to the seventh and eighth centuries, despite the plea for a much later date put forward by Prof. A. S. Cook of Yale) may possibly have been principal churchyard crosses. The fact that they were probably memorial crosses as well does not exclude this.

<p>When <a href="../cathen/01280b.htm">St. Aldhelm</a> died in 709, his body had to be transported fifty miles to Malmesbury, and at each stage of seven miles, where the body rested for the night, a cross was afterwards erected. These crosses were still standing in the twelfth century (<a href="../cathen/15633d.htm">William of Malmesbury</a>, Gesta Pont., 383). An even more famous example of such memorial crosses, but of much later date, is supplied by the removal of the body of Eleanor, Queen of Edward I, from Lincoln to London. Several of these crosses in a more or less mutilated form exist at the present day. The most famous of the series, however, Charing (? Ch&egrave;re Reine) Cross in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, is a modern reconstruction. The route followed by the body of St. Louis of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> on its way to St. Denis was similarly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a>, and it seems probable that a large number of wayside crosses originated in this manner. No stronger testimony of the early connection of the cross with the cemetery could be desired than the directions given by <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a> for his own burial: "Cum autem Deus susceperit animam meam, sepelite me in h&acirc;c mansione juxta oratorium meum ad meridiem, contra orientalem plagam sanct&aelig; crucis quam ibidem erexi" (Bede, Vita S. Cuthberti).
<h3 id="G">Rood, rood-screen, and rood-loft</h3>

<p>From very early times it seems to have been not unusual to introduce a plain cross in such a way into the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> or of the main arch (<em>Truimphbogen</em>) as to dominate the church. Notable examples may be found at S. Apollinare in Classe at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, at S. Pudenziana in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and at the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran basilica</a>. There are also, as already noticed, incontestable examples both of crosses surmounting the <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a> over the altar, and of the large crosses suspended, with or without a corona, from the under side of the <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a>. It must, however, be pronounced very <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether the rood, which in so many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries occupied the great arch, can be regarded as a development of this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. This point will be more fully treated under ROOD-SCREEN. It will be sufficient to notice here that in the thirteenth century a practice grew up of screening off the choir from the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> of the greater churches by a structure broad enough to admit a narrow bridge or gallery spanning the <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a> arch and most commonly adorned by a great crucifix with the figures of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> and <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John</a>. The rood-loft of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>, as described by J. B. Thiers (Trait&eacute; sur les jub&eacute;s) affords a valuable hint of how this process was effected. It consisted, he tells us, of two stone <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpits</a> quite separate from each other, supported by columns, and with a crucifix between them, each having an entrance on the choir side and an exit down into the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, on either side of the principal door of the choir. From this it seems probable that the two <a href="../cathen/01381e.htm">ambos</a> from which the Gospel and Epistle were sung in earlier times became gradually connected by a continuous gallery upon which was erected a great crucifix, and that in this way we may trace the development of the rood-loft, or jub&eacute;, which was so conspicuous a feature in later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> architecture. There can at least be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that this loft was used on certain occasions of <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> for reading the Epistle and Gospel and for making announcements to the people. The great rood above the rood-screen was saluted by the whole procession, as they re-entered the church on <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a>, with the words: <em>Ave Rex noster</em>.
<h3 id="H">Absolution crosses</h3>

<p>These have already been spoken of in the article <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">CHRISTIAN BURIAL</a>. They seem for the most part to have been rude crosses of lead laid upon the breast of the corpse. It is only in some few examples, of which the most important is that of Bishop Godfrey of <a href="../cathen/03657a.htm">Chichester</a> (1088), that a formula of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> is found inscribed upon them entire. We may infer that the practice in the West was always in some measure irregular, and it is only the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> paper which is uniformly placed in the hand or on the breast of the corpse in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, which explains them and gives them a certain importance as a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> development.
<h3 id="J">Crosses on vestments, etc.</h3>

<p>Rubrical law now requires that most of the vestments, as well as some other objects more immediately devoted to the service of the altar, should be marked with cross. Speaking generally this is a comparatively modern development. For example, the great majority of <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stoles</a> and <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniples</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> do not exhibit this feature. At the same time Dr. Wickham Legg goes much too far when he says without qualification that such crosses were not used in pre-Reformation times. For example the <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a> of <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas of Canterbury</a> preserved at <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a> has three crosses, one in the middle end one at each extremity, just as a modern stole would have. That the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">archiepiscopal pallium</a>, like the Greek <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm#omophorion"><em>omophorion</em></a> (<em>see</em> RITE OF CONSTANTINOPLE) was always marked with crosses, is not disputed. The large cross conspicuous upon most modern <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasubles</a>, which appears behind in the French type and in front in the Roman, does not seem to have been originally adopted with any symbolic purpose. It probably came into existence accidentally for sartorial reasons, the orphreys having been so arranged in a sort of Y-cross to conceal the seams. But the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, once suggested to the eye, was retained, and various symbolical reasons were found for it. In somewhat of the same way a cross was marked in the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> before the Canon. and this the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was directed to <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> when beginning this portion of the Mass; probably this cross first arose from an illumination of the initial T, in the words: <em>Te igitur clementissime Pater</em>. As <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> writes, "Et forte divin&acirc; factum est providenti&acirc; ut ab e&acirc; liter&acirc; T [<em>tau</em>] canon inciperet qu&aelig; sui form&acirc; signum crucis ostendit et exprimit in figur&acirc;"; and Beleth further comments, "Unde profecto est, quod istic crucis imago adpingi debeat" (See Ebner, Quellen und Forschungen, 445 sqq.). The tradition is perpetuated in the picture of the Crucifixion which precedes the Canon in every modern <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. The five crosses commonly marked on altar-atones depend closely on the rite of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of an altar.
<h3 id="K">Crosses for private devotion</h3>

<p>These may all be held to wear a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> aspect in so far as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in the "Rituale," provides a form for their blessing, and presupposes that such a cross should be placed in the hands of the dying. The crosses which surmount the Stations of the Cross, and to which the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a> are directly attached may also be noticed. In the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> a little wooden cross is used for the blessing of <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>, and is dipped into it in the course of the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>.
<h2 id="section2">Liturgical forms connected with the material objects</h2>
<h3 id="A">Blessing of consecration crosses</h3>

<p>The "Pontificale Romanum" directs that towards the close of the dedication <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> the twelve <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> crosses previously marked upon the walls of the church, three upon each wall, are to be each anointed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, the following form of words being spoken over each: "May this Temple be hallowed <strong>+</strong> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <strong>+</strong> in the name of the Father <strong>+</strong> and of the Son <strong>+</strong> and of the Holy Ghost <strong>+</strong> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the glorious Virgin Mary and of all the Saints, to the name and memory of Saint N. Peace be to thee." This is prescribed in practically identical terms in English pontificals of the tenth century; and the Pontifical of Egbert (? 768) describes the anointing of the walls, though it does not give the words or the form. What is more, an analogous <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> must have existed in the Celtic Church from a very early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, for a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> fragment in the Leabar Breac describes how the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> with two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> is to go round the outside of the church marking crosses upon the "tel-columns" with his knife, while the three other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> do the same within (see Olden in "Trans. St. Paul's Eccles. Soc.", IV, 103). In this case, however, the use of <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a> is not mentioned. From this Celtic practice the Anglo-Saxon and Sarum uses seem to have derived the custom of affixing <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> crosses outside the church as well as within.
<h3 id="B">Consecration of the altar</h3>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of an altar, also, crosses are to be marked in <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a> upon the altar-slab with almost the same form of words as that used for the walls. This practice may equally claim Celtic analogues, whose antiquity is shown by the fact that the altar to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> must have been of wood. The Tract in the "Leabar Breac" says: "The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> marks four crosses with his knife on the four corners of the altar, and he marks three crosses over the middle of the altar, a cross over the middle on the east to the edge, and a cross over the middle on the west to the edge, and a cross exactly over the middle." This makes seven crosses, but the Roman usage for many centuries has provided five only.
<h3 id="C">Pontifical blessings of crosses</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> crosses on the walls of churches and on altars are clearly not substantive and independent objects of cultus; the blessing they receive is only a detail in a longer <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. But the "Pontificale Romanum" supplies a solemn form of episcopal blessing for a cross, under the title, <em>Benedictio nov&aelig; Crucis</em>, which, besides containing several <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of considerable length, includes a consecratory preface and is accompanied with the use of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>. At the conclusion of the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> we find the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a>: "Tum Pontifex, flexis ante crucem genibus, ipsam devote adorat et osculatur." This rite is of great antiquity, and many of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> occur in identical terms in pontificals of the tenth century or earlier, e.g. in the <a href="../cathen/02465a.htm">Benedictional</a> of Archbishop Robert (Henry Bradshaw Soc.). But in the ancient <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> the cross was first washed with <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a> and then anointed with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a> precisely as in the form for the blessing of bells (see <a href="../cathen/02418b.htm">BELLS</a>). For cemetery crosses in this connection, see <a href="../cathen/03504a.htm">CEMETERY</a>.
<h3 id="D">Blessings of crosses in the Ritual</h3>

<p>The "Rituale Romanum" (tit. VIII, cap. xxiv) supplies an ordinary blessing for a cross which may be used by any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. It consists only of a short <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, with a second <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> whose use is optional, and only <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a> is used; but the same <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a> directing the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to kneel and "devoutly adore and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> the cross" is added, which we have just noticed in the solemn episcopal benediction. Furthermore, the Ritual, in an appendix, reprints the longer form from the Pontifical under the heading: "Benedictiones reservat&aelig;, ab episcopo vel sacerdotibus facultatem habentibus faciend&aelig;". It may be noted that St. Louis, King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, regarded it as unseemly that crosses and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> should be set up for veneration without being previously blessed. He accordingly ordered search to be made for a form of blessing in the ancient episcopal ceremonials. The form was found and duly used first of all in St. Louis' own private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>; but the incident seems to suggest that the practice of blessing such objects had partly fallen into desuetude. (See Galfridus, De Bello Loco, cap. xxxvi.)
<h3 id="E">Blessings of crosses for indulgences etc.</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> most commonly attached to crosses, crucifixes, etc., are: first, the so-called <a href="../cathen/07788a.htm">"Apostolic Indulgences"</a>, which are the same as those attached to objects blessed by the Holy Father in person. These are numerous and, amongst other things, entitle the possessor who has habitually worn or used such a cross to a plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> at the hour of death; secondly, the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> of the Stations of the Cross, which under certain conditions may be gained by the sick and others unable to visit a church upon the recitation of twenty Paters, Aves, and Glorias before the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgenced</a> cross which they must hold in their hand; thirdly, the so-called "Bona Mors" <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> for the use of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, enabling the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by the use of this cross to communicate a plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> to any dying <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is in the requisite dispositions to receive it; Special faculties are needed to communicate such <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> to crosses, etc., though in the case of the <a href="../cathen/07788a.htm">"Apostolic Indulgences"</a> these faculties are easily obtained. The only blessing required is the making of a simple <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> over the crucifix or other object with the intention of imparting the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>. For further details, the reader must be referred to the article <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">INDULGENCES</a> and to such treatises upon <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> as those of Beringer, "Les Indulgences" or of Mocchegiani, "Collectio Indulgentiarum" (Quaracchi, 1897). (See also <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">BLESSINGS</a>.)
<h2 id="section3">Festivals of the Holy Cross</h2>
<h3 id="A">The Invention of the Holy Cross</h3>

<p>This is now kept by the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> upon 3 May, but so far as our somewhat uncertain data allow us to judge, the real date of <a href="../cathen/07202b.htm">St. Helena's</a> discovery was 14 September, 326. Upon this same day, 14 September, took place the dedication of <a href="../cathen/04295a.htm">Constantine's</a> two churches, that of the Anastasis and that of Golgotha <em>Ad Crucem</em>, both upon Calvary, within the precincts of the present church of the Holy Sepulchre. The portion of the Holy Cross preserved in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> afterwards fell into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, but was recovered by the Emperor Heraclius, and, if we may trust our authorities, was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> brought back to Jerusalem on 3 May, 629. This day, strangely enough, seems to have attracted special attention among Celtic <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgists</a> in the West and, though disregarded in the East, has passed through Celtic channels (we meet it first in the Lectionary of Silos and in the Bobbio <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>) into general recognition under the mistaken title of "Invention of the Cross". Curiously enough the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> keeps a feast of the apparition of the Cross to <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a> on 7 May, though that of 3 May is unknown in the East.
<h3 id="B">The Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross</h3>

<p>The Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross, 14 September, though apparently introduced into the West somewhat later than the so-called "Invention" on 3 May, seems to preserve the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> date of the discovery of the Cross by St. Helena. This festival has always been kept in the East, and especially at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, on that day, under the name of, i.e. "elevation" which probably meant originally the "bringing to light".
<h3 id="C">Other feasts of the cross</h3>

<p>We might in some sense regard such a festival as that of the Holy Lance and Nails as a festival of the Cross, but it should perhaps rather be grouped with feasts of the Passion. In the East, however, we find other celebrations strictly connected with the Cross. For example, on 1 August the Greeks commemorate the taking of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the Holy Cross from the palace in Constantinople to the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Sophia, and on 7 May, as we have seen, they recall an apparition of the Cross to <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, on the other hand, observe one principal feast of the Cross, under the name <em>Chatz</em>, which occurs in autumn almost immediately after the feast of the Assumption. It is counted as one of the seven principal feasts of the year, is preceded by a week's fast, and followed by an octave or its <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> equivalent. See also <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE CROSS AND CRUCIFIX</a>.
<h2 id="section4">The "adoration"</h2>

<p>From a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> standpoint this is treated above under <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE CROSS AND CRUCIFIX</a>. (See also <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">LATRIA</a>.) As a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> function the veneration of the Cross on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> must no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> be traced back, as Amalarius already in the ninth century correctly divined, to the practice of honouring the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a> at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> which is described in detail in the "Pilgrimage of Etheria", c. 380 (see <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">TRUE CROSS</a>.) The <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> came to prevail everywhere where <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a> existed, and by a very natural development, where <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> failed any ordinary cross supplied their place as an object of cultus. As Amalarius again sensibly remarks, "although every church cannot have such a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a>, still the virtue of the Holy <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a> is not wanting in those crosses which are made in imitation of it." Neither was this veneration, in the case at any rate, of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a>, confined to <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>. <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a> uses language which may possibly imply that in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a> was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> every Wednesday and Friday. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that at Constantinople a Sunday in Mid-Lent, the first of August, and the 14th of September were similarly privileged. Even from early times there was no hesitation about using the word <em>adoratio</em>. Thus, <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">St. Paulinus of Nola</a>, writing of the great <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> (c. 410), declares that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> offered it to the people for worship (<em>crucem quotannis adorandam populo promit</em>), and first adored it himself. (See P.L., LXI, 325.) A curious practice was also introduced of anointing the cross, or, on occasion, any image or picture, with balm (<em>balsamo</em>) before presenting it for the veneration of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. This custom was transferred to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and we hear much of it in connection with the very ancient <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a> and also the supposed <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> portrait of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Saviour</a> (<em>acheiropoieta</em>, i.e. not made by the hand of man) preserved in the Sancta Sanctorum of the Lateran, both of which recently, together with a multitude of other objects, have been examined and reported on by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> permission (see Grisar Die r&ouml;mische Kapelle Sancta Sanctorum und ihr Schatz, Fre&iacute;burg, 1908, 91, 92). The objects mentioned were completely covered in part with solidified balm. <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Pope Adrian I</a>, in vindicating the veneration of images to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, mentions this use of balm and defends it (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, Concilia, XIII, 778). The <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of the adoration of the Cross on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> must have spread through the West in the seventh and eighth centuries, for it appears in the Gelasian Sacramentary and is presupposed in the <a href="../cathen/01579a.htm">Gregorian Antiphonarium</a>. Both in Anglo-Saxon <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> of the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the "Creeping to the Cross" was a <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> which made a deep impression on the popular mind. St. Louis of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>: and other <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> princes dressed themselves in haircloth and crept to the cross barefoot. At present, instead of creeping to the cross on hands and knees, three profound double genuflexions are made before <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissing</a> the feet of the crucifix, and the sacred <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> remove their shoes when performing the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. The collection now commonly made on this occasion for the support of the Holy Places seems also to date from <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a>.
<h2 id="section5">Manual sign of the cross</h2>

<p>For the <em>Figure of the Cross as a Manual Sign of Blessing</em> the reader must be referred to the article <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">SIGN OF THE CROSS</a>, also subtitles (4) of <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE CROSS</a> and (1) of <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">TRUE CROSS</a>.
<h2 id="section6">Dedications of churches, etc. to the Holy Cross</h2>

<p>Possibly one of the earliest dedications to the Cross, if we put aside Constantine's church upon Calvary known in Etheria's time as<em> Ad Crucem</em> and also the Sessorian basilica which was its Roman counterpart, was the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> erected at <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> by St. Rhadegund in the sixth century. In behalf of this foundation the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> begged and obtained a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a> from the Emperor Justin II at Constantinople.

<p>The bringing of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> to Poitiers was the occasion of the composition of the two famous <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> by <a href="../cathen/06149a.htm">Venantius Fortunatus</a>, <a href="../cathen/15396a.htm">"Vexilla regis"</a> and "Pange, lingua, gloriosi pr&aelig;lium certaminis". In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> perhaps the most famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> bearing this dedication was the <a href="../cathen/15545a.htm">Holy Cross Abbey at Waltham</a>, founded by King Harold. At present about sixty ancient English churches are dedicated to the Holy Cross, while twenty more bear the same dedication in the distinctively-English form of "Holy Rood". The famous Holyrood Palace in <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>, once occupied by <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Queen of Scots</a>, derives its name from a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Holy Rood upon the site of which it was erected, and its church, now in ruins, was originally the church of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>.
<h2 id="section7">The Cross in religious orders and in the Crusades</h2>

<p>Although the older orders were earnest in conforming to the general usage of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as regards the veneration of the Cross, no distinctive cultus seems to be attributable to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. The practice of carrying a crucifix as part of the ordinary religious habit seems to be of comparatively modern date. It is significant that, although in most modern congregations of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> the bestowal of the crucifix is a prominent feature of the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of profession, the service in the Roman Pontifical, "De Benedictione et Consecratione Virginum", knows nothing of it. It provides for the giving of rings and crosses but not of crucifixes. Probably much of the stimulus given to devotion to the crucifix may be traced ultimately to <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> influences, and it is not mere coincidence that the development in art of the agonized and thorn-crowned type of figure upon the Cross coincides more or less exactly with the great <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> revival of the thirteenth century. Somewhat earlier than the time of Francis an Italian Order of <em>crociferi</em> (cross-bearers), distinguished by carrying as part of their costume a plain cross of wood or metal, was founded in the neighbourhood of Bologna to tend the sick, and several other orders, particularly one established shortly afterwards in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> and still surviving, have since borne the same or a similar name. In the case of the <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">Military Orders</a>, for example, that of <a href="../cathen/07477a.htm">St. John of Jerusalem</a> or Knights <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a>, the cross impressed upon their habit has gradually become distinctive of the order. It seems to have been originally only the badge of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>, who wore a red cross upon their right shoulders as a token of the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> they had taken upon themselves. The Roman Pontifical still contains the ceremonial for the blessing and imposition of the cross upon those who set out for the aid and defence of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> or for the recovery of the Holy Land. After the cross has been blessed the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> imposes it upon the candidate with the words: "Receive the sign of the cross, in the Name of the Father <strong>+</strong> and of the Son <strong>+</strong> and of the Holy Ghost <strong>+</strong> in token of the Cross, Passion, and Death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for the defence of thy body and thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that by the favour of the Divine Goodness when thy journey is accomplished thou mayest return to thy <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> safe and amended [<em>salvus et emendatus</em>]. Through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Our Lord</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>." The crosses conferred by sovereigns in connection with various orders of knighthood may probably be traced to the same <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>.

<p>The various types of cross have rather to do with <a href="../cathen/07243a.htm">heraldry</a> or art than with the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of Christianity</a>. The names and shapes of the more common varieties can best be gathered from the annexed table. For the vast majority the form is purely conventional and artificial. Their divergence from the normal type is a mere freak of fancy and corresponds to no attempt to reproduce the shape of the gibbet on which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Saviour</a> died, or to convey any symbolical meaning. The <em>crux ansata</em>, or cross with a handle, and the <em>crux gammata</em>, or "fylfot", are much more ancient than <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. (See in <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE CROSS</a>, (1) Primitive Cruciform Signs.) The <em>chrismon</em>, or <em>chi-rho</em>, has already been mentioned as the earliest forms in which the cross appear in <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> [Section I (4)]. The forms which it took varied considerably and it is difficult to classify them chronologically. -With regard to the great Celtic stone crosses, particularly in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, we may note the tendency conspicuous in so many specimens to surround the cross within a circle. It is just conceivable that there is foundation for regarding this circle as derived from the loop of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <em>crux ansata</em>.
<h2 id="section8">The cross outside of the Catholic Church</h2>

<p>In the Russian Church the conventional form in which the cross is usually shown is in fact a three-barred cross, of which the upper bar represents the title of the cross, the second the arms, and the lowest, which is always inclined at an angle, the <em>suppedaneum</em> or foot-rest. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> it may be said that in the early years of Elizabeth's reign a clean sweep was made of the crosses so long <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> by the people. All the roods were ordered to be pulled down, and the crosses were removed from the altars, or rather the communion-tables which replaced the altars. The only check in this movement was the fact that the queen herself, for some rather obscure reason, insisted at first on retaining the crucifix in her own private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. The presence of a crucifix or even a plain cross upon the altar was long held to be illegal in virtue of the "Ornaments Rubrics". In recent years, however, there has been a notable reaction, and crosses, or even crucifixes, are quite commonly seen upon the altar of <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> churches. Again, in the reredos recently erected in St. Paul's Cathedral in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> a large crucifix, with the figures of St. Mary and St. John, forms the most conspicuous feature. In <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> churches there has always been much tolerance for the crucifix either upon or behind the altar.
