<h1>The Defect of Birth</h1>  

<p>(ILLEGITIMACY)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">canonical impediment</a> to <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>. When used in this connection, the word <em>illegitimate</em> has, in canon law, a well-defined meaning, which is: "born out of lawful wedlock". <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">Illegitimate birth</a> is an impediment to the reception of orders, and inhibits the exercise of the functions of orders already received. It is a <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">canonical impediment</a>, because established and laid down in the canon law as a hindrance to entering the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> state. This prohibition does not touch the validity of orders, but makes the reception of them illicit. It extends to first <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>. The inhibition that is set up is restricted to the functions that belong exclusively to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In the early ages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> no law prevented the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimates</a>. They were then, sometimes, debarred from <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, but only because of a real or supposed depravity of life. <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Pope Urban II</a> (1088-99) prohibited the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> offspring of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, unless they became members of approved <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. The Council of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, under Paschal II (1099-1118), extended this prohibition to all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate birth</a>. These regulations were later approved by other <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and councils.

<p>The law as laid down in the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> of Gregory IX (I, X) mentions only the offspring of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and those begotten in fornication. But in the sixth book of the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate birth</a> are expressly included. These may be ranged in the following classes: (1) Natural <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimates</a>, or the offspring of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> who at the time of the birth or conception of such offspring, were capable of contracting <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Christian marriage</a>. (2) Spurious <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimates</a>, or those born of a known mother and an unknown father &mdash; unknown because the mother had carnal relations with several men. (3) Adulterine <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimates</a>, those begotten of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, one or both of whom, at the time of conception and birth of such offspring, were lawfully married to a third <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. (4) Incest <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimates</a>, or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whose <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> could not marry because of an invalidating impediment of <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a> or affinity. (5) Sacrilegious <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimates</a>, or the offspring of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> who are restrained from marriage because of the impediment of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> or solemn religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. The practice of the present day also holds as <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimates</a> abandoned children of unknown parentage. Legitimacy may not be presumed or established by negative <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. Positive documentary evidence must be adduced.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimacy</a> directly debars all the foregoing classes of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> from promotion to orders, and the exercise of the functions proper to the orders already received; and it indirectly prevents such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> from obtaining a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. Directly, also, it prevents them from obtaining certain <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. 25, c. 15 de ref.) Decreed that the <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> children of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> should be incapacitated from obtaining any kind of a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> where their fathers held one; from rendering any service in said church; and from receiving any pensions on the revenues of the paternal <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. This law is not established and laid down as a punishment for the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom it is applied. It safeguards the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and dignity of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> state which has the dispensing of the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must be beyond reproach. No stain should be upon it, no blame possible. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> raises the barrier of <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimacy</a> before the entrance to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Thus the crime of the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> is held up to just reprobation, and is condemned even in the lives of their offspring. The danger of the father's incontinence being continued in the life of the son is greatly lessened, for strong indications of purity of life must be given before the door of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> ministry can be opened.

<p>The defect of <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate birth</a> may be cured in four ways: (1) By the subsequent marriage of the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; (2) By a <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; (3) By <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>; (4) By a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>.

<p>(1) The subsequent marriage of the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of an <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> has, by a fiction of law, a retroactive power which carries the marriage back to the time of the birth of the offspring and covers it with lawful wedlock. In order that the fiction of law may produce this effect, the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, at the time of the conception or, at least, at the birth of such offspring, must have been capable of contracting lawful marriage. Therefore, this more of legitimation is applicable only to natural <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimates</a>. And these, though legitimized by the subsequent marriage of the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, or even by an Apostolic <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, are forever excluded from the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>. (2) A <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> confers legitimacy in so far as it is required for spiritual affairs throughout the universal Church. (3) Religious profession in an approved order cures the defect of <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimacy</a>. Religious profession is the taking of the solemn religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>; but the simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> taken after the noviciate in some orders produce a like effect. This mode of legitimation only renders <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimates</a> capable of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>. It cannot be extended to dignities or even to regular prelacies. Hence, <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimates</a> thus legitimized are still debarred from the position of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>; and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate birth</a>, for like reasons, cannot hold the position of <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> or <a href="../cathen/12428a.htm">prioress</a>. (4) A <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> granted by a lawful superior removes the defect of <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate birth</a>, but only for some express purpose. It is not a mode of absolute legitimation. The purposes for which it is granted must be specified; as for promotion to <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, to major orders, to a specified <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>.

<p>A <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> of this kind runs counter to the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>. It is of strict interpretation, and therefore cannot be extended from like to like or from greater to less, unless the one is included in, and presupposes, the other. Such is the case when a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> is conceded to an <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> to receive <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>. Such orders require a title, and this title is, in canon law, a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is the lawful superior for the universal Church, and as such he can dispense in all cases where a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> is possible. Bishops and other <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> having quasi-episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> can dispense their own subjects, in this matter, for first <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>, <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, or a simple <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>; but not for major orders, even though the <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimacy</a> be occult. This episcopal, or quasi-episcopal, <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> does not extend to a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> which was immediately possessed by the father of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> seeking the <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, nor to a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> which by custom or privilege requires its possessor to be in major orders.
