<h1>The Didache</h1>  

<p>(D<font size=-2>OCTRINE OF THE</font> T<font size=-2>WELVE</font> A<font size=-2>POSTLES</font>)

<p>A short treatise which was accounted by some of the Fathers as next to <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. It was rediscovered in 1873 by Bryennios, Greek Orthodox <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, in the codex from which, in 1875, he had published the full text of the Epistles of St. Clement. The title in the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> is <em>Didache kyriou dia ton dodeka apostolon ethesin</em>, but before this it gives the heading <em>Didache ton dodeka apostolon</em>. The old Latin translation of cc. i-v, found by Dr. J. Schlecht in 1900, has the longer title, omitting "twelve", and has a <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a> <em>De doctrin&acirc; Apostolorum</em>. For convenience the contents may be divided into three parts: the first is the "Two Ways", the Way of Life and the Way of Death; the second part is a <em>rituale</em> dealing with <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>; the third speaks of the ministry. Doctrinal teaching is presupposed, and none is imparted.

<p>The Didache is mentioned by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> after the books of Scripture (<a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.25.4</a>): "Let there be placed among the spuria the writing of the Acts of Paul, the so-called Shepherd and the Apocalypse of Peter, and besides these the Epistle known as that of Barnabas, and what are called the Teachings of the Apostles, and also . . . the Apocalypse of John, if this be thought fit . . ." <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> and Rufinus add the "Teaching" to the sapiential and other deutero-canonical books. (Rufinus gives the curious alternative title "Judicium Petri".) It has a similar place in the lists of Nicephorus, Pseudo-Anastasius, and Pseudo-Athanasius (Synopsis). The Pseudo-Cyprianic "Adversus Aleatores" quotes it by name. Unacknowledged citations are very common, if less certain. The "Two Ways" appears in Barnabas, cc. xviii-xx, sometimes word for word, sometimes added to, dislocated, or abridged, and Barn., iv, 9 is from Didache, xvi, 2-3, or vice versa. Hermas, Iren&aelig;us, <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> seem to use the work, and so in the West do Optatus and the "Gesta apud Zenophilum". The Didascalia Apostolorum are founded upon the Didache. The Apostolic church ordinance has used a part, the Apostolic Constitutions have embodied the Didascalia. There are echoes in <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a>, <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, Theophilus, <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, and Lactantius.</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<h3>First Part</h3>

<p>The Way of Life is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of our neighbour. The latter only is spoken of at length. We first find the Golden Rule in the negative form (cf. the "Western" text of <a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs19">Acts 15:19 and 29</a>). Then short extracts from the Sermon on the Mount, together with a curious passage on giving and receiving, which is cited with variations by Hermas (Mand., ii, 4-6). The Latin omits ch. i, 3-6 and ch. ii, 1, and these sections have no parallel in Barnabas; they may therefore be a later addition, and Hermas and the present text of the Didache may have used a common source, or Hermas may be the original. The second chapter contains the Commandments against <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, theft, coveting, and <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">false witness</a> &mdash; in this order - and additional recommendations depending on these. In ch. iii we are told how one vice leads to another: <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> to <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and so forth. This section shows some close likenesses to the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> Talmud. The whole chapter is passed over in Barnabas. A number of <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> are added in ch. iv, which ends: "This is the Way of Life." The Way of Death is a mere list of vices to be avoided (v). Ch. vi exhorts to the keeping in the Way of this Teaching: "If thou canst bear the whole yoke of the Lord, thou wilt be perfect; but if thou canst not, do what thou canst. But as for food, bear what thou canst; but straitly avoid things offered to idols; for it is a service of dead gods." Many take this to be a recommendation to abstain from flesh, as some explain <a href="../bible/rom014.htm#vrs2">Romans 14:2</a>. But the "let him eat herbs" of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> is a hyperbolical expression like <a href="../bible/1co008.htm#vrs13">1 Corinthians 8:13</a>: "I will never eat flesh, lest I should scandalize my brother", and gives no support to the notion of vegetarianism in the Early Church. The Didache is referring to Jewish meats. The Latin version substitutes for ch. vi a similar close, omitting all reference to meats and to <em>idolothyta</em>, and concluding with <em>per d. n. j. C . . . .</em> <em>in s&aelig;cula s&aelig;culorum, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a></em>. This is the end of the translation. We see that the translator lived at a day when <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> had disappeared, and when the remainder of the Didache was out of date. He had no such reason for omitting ch. i, 3-6, so that this was presumably not in his copy.
<h3>Second Part</h3>

<p>This (vii-x) begins with an instruction on <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which is to be conferred "in the Name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost" in living water, if it can be had &mdash; if not, in cold or even hot water. The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and, if possible, the baptizer, and other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> must fast for one or two days previously. If the water is insufficient for immersion, it may be poured thrice on the head. This is said by Bigg to show a late date; but it seems a natural concession for hot and dry countries, when <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was not as yet celebrated exclusively at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> and Pentecost and in churches, where a <em>columbethra</em> and a supply of water would not be wanting. Fasts are not to be on Monday and Thursday "with the <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrites</a>" (i.e. the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>), but on Wednesday and Friday (viii). Nor must <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrites</a>, but they shall say the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Our Father</a> thrice a day. The text of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not quite that of St. Matthew, and it is given with the <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm">doxology</a> "for Thine is the power and the glory for ever", whereas all but a few <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of St. Matthew have this interpolation with "the kingdom and the power" etc.



<p>Ch. ix runs thus: "Concerning the Eucharist, thus shall you give thanks: 'We give Thee thanks, our Father, for the holy Vine of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> Thy Child, which Thou hast made known to us through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> Thy Child; to Thee be the glory for ever'. And of the broken Bread: 'We give Thee thanks, our Father, for the Life and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which Thou hast made known to us through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> Thy Child; to Thee be glory for ever. For as this broken Bread was dispersed over the mountains, and being collected became one, so may Thy Church be gathered together from the ends of the earth into Thy kingdom, for Thine is the glory and the power through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> for ever.' And let none eat or drink of your Eucharist but those who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the Name of Christ; for of this the Lord said: 'Give not the holy Thing to the dogs'." These are clearly <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> after the Consecration and before Communion. Ch. x gives a thanksgiving after Communion, slightly longer, in which mention is made of the "spiritual food and drink and eternal Life through Thy Child". After a <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm">doxology</a>, as before, come the remarkable exclamations: "Let grace come, and this world pass away! <a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Son of David</a>! If any is holy, let him come. If any be not, let him repent. Maranatha. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>". We are not only reminded of the <em>Hosanna</em> and <em>Sancta sanctis</em> of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, but also of <a href="../bible/rev022.htm">Apocalypse 22:17-20</a>, and <a href="../bible/1co016.htm#vrs22">1 Corinthians 16:22</a>. In these <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> we find deep reverence, and the effect of the Eucharist for eternal Life, though there is no distinct mention of the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a>. The words in thanksgiving for the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> are echoed by <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, "Quis div.", 29: "It is He [Christ] Who has poured out the Wine, the Blood of the Vine of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, upon our wounded <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>"; and by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, "In i Judic.", Hom. vi: "Before we are inebriated with the Blood of the True Vine Which ascends from the root of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>." The mention of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> before the bread is in accordance with St. Luke, xxii, 17-19, in the "Western" text (which omits verse 20), and is apparently from a Jewish blessing of wine and bread, with which rite the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in ch. ix have a close affinity.
<h3>The Third Part</h3>

<p>The Third Part speaks first of teachers or <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> (<em>didaskaloi</em>) in general. These are to be received if they teach the above <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>; and if they add the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Lord they are to be received as the Lord. Every Apostle is to be received as the Lord, and he may stay one day or two, but if he stay three, he is a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. On leaving he shall take nothing with him but bread. If he ask for money, he is a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. Similarly with the order of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: to judge them when they speak in the spirit is the unpardonable <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but they must be known by their <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. If they seek gain, they are to be rejected. All travellers who come in the name of the Lord are to be received, but only for two or three days; and they must exercise their trade, if they have one, or at least must not be idle. Anyone who will not work is a <em>Christemporos</em> &mdash; one who makes a gain out of the name of Christ. Teachers and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> are worthy of their food. Firstfruits are to be given to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, "for they are your <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">High Priests</a>; but if you have not a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, give the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruits</a> to the poor". The breaking of bread and Thanksgiving [Eucharist] is on Sunday, "after you have confessed your transgressions, that your Sacrifice may be pure", and those who are at discord must agree, for this is the clean oblation prophesied by Malachias, i, 11, 14. "Ordain therefore for yourselves <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, worthy of the Lord . . . for they also minister to you the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and teachers". Notice that it is for the sacrifice that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> are to be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>. The last chapter (xvi) exhorts to watching and tells the signs of the end of the world.
<h2>Sources</h2>

<p>It is held by very many critics that the "Two Ways" is older than the rest of the Didache, and is in origin a Jewish work, intended for the instruction of <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselytes</a>. The use of the Sibylline Oracles and other Jewish sources may be probable, and the agreement of ch. ii with the Talmud may be certain; but on the other hand Funk has shown that (apart from the admittedly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ch. i, 3-6, and the occasional citations of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>) the 0. T. is often not quoted directly, but from the Gospels. Bartlet suggests an oral Jewish catechesis as the source. But the use of such material would surprise us in one whose name for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> is "the hypocrites", and in the vehemently anti-Jewish Barnabas still more. The whole base of this theory is destroyed by the fact that the rest of the work, vii-xvi, though wholly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> in its subject-matter, has an equally remarkable agreement with the Talmud in cc. ix and x. Beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> we must look upon the writer as living at a very early period when Jewish influence was still important in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He warns <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> not to fast with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with them; yet the two <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> and the three times of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> are modelled on Jewish custom. Similarly the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> stand in the place of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">High Priest</a>.
<h2>Date</h2>

<p>There are other signs of early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>: the simplicity of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> rite, which is apparently neither preceded by <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcisms</a> nor by formal admission to the catechumenate; the simplicity of the Eucharist, in comparison with the elaborate quasi-Eucharistic <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in Clement, <a href="../fathers/1010.htm">I Corinthians 59-61</a>; the permission to <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> to extemporize their Eucharistic thanksgiving; the immediate expectation of the second advent. As we find the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Christian Sunday</a> already substituted for the Jewish <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> as the day of assembly in <a href="../bible/act020.htm">Acts 20:7</a> and <a href="../bible/1co016.htm#vrs2">1 Corinthians 16:2</a>, and called the Lord's day (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs10">Revelation 1:10</a>), there is no difficulty in supposing that the parallel and consequent shifting of the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> to Wednesday and Friday may have taken place at an equally early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, at least in some places. But the chief point is the ministry. It is twofold: (1) local and (2) itinerant. &mdash; (1) The local <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> are <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, as in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/phi001.htm#vrs1">Philippians 1:1</a>) and St. Clement. Presbyters are not mentioned, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are clearly presbyter-bishops, as in <a href="../bible/act020.htm">Acts 20</a>, and in the Pastoral <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. But when St. Ignatius wrote in 107, or at the latest 117, the three orders of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> were already considered <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to the very name of a Church, in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. If it is probable that in St. Clement's time there was as yet no "monarchical" <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, yet such a state of things cannot have lasted long in any important Church. On this ground therefore the Didache must be set either in the first century or else in some backwater of church life. The itinerant ministry is obviously yet more archaic. In the second century prophecy was a charisma only and not a ministry, except among the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a>. &mdash; (2) The itinerant <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> are not mentioned by Clement or Ignatius. The three orders are apostles, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and teachers, as in <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#vrs28">1 Corinthians 12:28 sq.</a>: "God hath set some in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; first apostles, secondly <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, thirdly <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> [teachers]; after that <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">miracles</a>, then the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> of healings, helps, governments, kinds of tongues, interpretations of speeches. Are all apostles? Are all <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>? Are all <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>?" The Didache places teachers below apostles and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, the two orders which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> makes the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (<a href="../bible/eph002.htm#vrs20">Ephesians 2:20</a>). The term <em>apostle</em> is applied by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> not only to the Twelve, but also to himself, to Barnabas, to his kinsmen, Andronicus and Junias, who had been converted before him, and to a class of preachers of the first rank. But apostles must have "seen the Lord" and have received a special call. There is no instance in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> or in early literature of the existence of an order called apostles later than the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> age. We have no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to assume a second-century order of apostles, who had not seen Christ in the flesh, for the sake of bolstering up a preconceived notion of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the Didache. Since in that work the visit of an apostle or of a pretended apostle is contemplated as a not improbable event, we cannot place the book later than about 80. The limit, would seem to be from 65 to 80. Harnack gives 131-160, holding that Barnabas and the Didache independently employ a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianized</a> form of the Jewish "Two Ways", while Did., xvi, is citing Barnabas &mdash; a somewhat roundabout hypothesis. He places Barnabas in 131, and the Didache later than this. Those who date Barnabas under <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> mostly make the Didache the borrower in cc. i-v and xvi. Many, with Funk, place Barnabas under Nerva. The commoner view is that which puts the Didache before 100. Bartlet agrees with Ehrhard that 80-90 is the most probable decade. Sabatier, Minasi, Jacquier, and others have preferred a date even before 70.

<p>As to the place of composition, many suggest <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> because they think the "Epistle of Barnabas" was written there. The corn upon the mountains does not suit <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, though it might be a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> borrowed from Palestine. There are really no materials even for a conjecture on the subject.

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">A Latin fragment of the <em>Two Ways</em> was published in 1723 by PEZ in <em>Thesaurus Anecdotorum</em>, IV. The first Greek edition is <em>Didache ton dodeka apostolon ek tou Hierosolymitikou Cheirographou noun proton ekdedomene meta prolegomenon kai semeioseon . . . Hypo philotheou Brouenniou, metropolitou Nikomedeias. En Konstantinoupolei</em> (1883). The MS. was reproduced in phototype in the fine edition by HARRIS, <em>The Teaching of the Apostles, newly edited with facsimile text and a commentary</em> (Baltimore and London, 1887). The Latin version was published by SCHLECHT, first in a shilling brochure, then in a larger edition with the Greek and notes (Freiburg im Br., 1900-1901). Of the Greek a very large number of editions have appeared, mostly with translations: DE ROMESTIN (Oxford, 1884); SPENCE (London, 1885); HITCHCOCK AND BROWN (New York 1884-5); FITZGERALD (New York, 1884); ORRIS (New York 1884); SCHAFF (New York, 1884-9); also by SABATIER (Paris, 1885); JACQUIER (Lyons, 1881); MINASI (Rome, 1891). It was included in HILGENFELD, <em>Nov. Test. extra canonem receptum</em> (1884), fasc. iv, and in the editions of the <em>Apostolic Fathers</em> by LIGHTFOOT-HARMER (with Eng. tr., 1891-3-8), GEBHARDT, HARNACK AND ZAHN (Leipzig, 1900), FUNK (T&uuml;bingen, 1901', and VIZZINI (Rome, 1902). Special notice is called for by the following: TAYLOR, <em>The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles, with Illustrations from the Talmud</em> (Cambridge, 1908); IDEM, <em>An Essay on the Theology of the Didache</em> (Cambridge, 1889); IDEM <em>in Journal of Philol</em>., XVIII, XIX, XXI, and in <em>Journal of Theol</em>. <em>Studies</em> (Oct., 1906); BARTLET in HASTINGS, Dict. of Bib. (extra vol., 1904); HARNACK, <em>Die Lehre der zw&ouml;lf Apostel</em> (larger ed., Leipzig, 1884) and <em>Die Apostellehre and die j&uuml;dischen zwei Wege</em> (smaller ed., Leipzig, 1886 and 1896); IDEM, <em>Gesch. der altchr. Litt.</em>, I, 86 and II (<em>Chronol</em>., I), 428; FUNK, <em>Doctrina XII Apostolorum</em> (T&uuml;bingen, 1887); and the introduction to his ed. of the <em>Ap. Fathers</em>, supra; IDEM in <em>T&uuml;b. Theol. Quartalschr</em>., LXVI, LXVIII, LXIX LXXVI, LXXIX (1884-86-87-94-97); much of the matter of these articles is republished by FUNK in his <em>Kirchengeschichtliche Abhandlungen</em>, (Paderborn, 1899), II. Among other matter also SAVI, <em>La Dottrina dei XII Ap., ricerche critiche sull' origine del testo </em>(Rome, 1893); and in <em>Studi e docum. di storia e diritto</em> (1892), XIII; HENNECKE, <em>Die Grundschrift der Didache und ihre Recensionen</em> in <em>Zeitschr. f&uuml;r N.-T. Wiss.</em> (1901), II; KOCH, <em>Die Did. bei Cyprian, ibid.</em> (1907), VIII; CHIAPPELLI, <em>Studi di antica letteratura cristiana</em> (Turin 1887); LADEUZE in <em>Rev. d'hist. eccl.</em> (Louvain, 1901), II. On the ministry in the <em>Didache</em>, see R&Eacute;VILLE (Prot.) <em>Origines de l'Episcopat</em> (Paris, 1894); MICHIELS (Cath.), <em>Origine de l'Episc.</em> (Louvain, 1900). On baptism, BIGG in <em>Jour. of Theol. Studies</em> (July, 1904), v. Dr. Bigg (<em>ibid</em>., VI, April, 1905) places the <em>Didache</em> in the fourth century. On the saying (Did., i, 6), "Let thy alms sweat in thy hands, till thou know to whom to give", see TAYLOR in <em>Jour. of Philol</em>., XIX (as above); TURNER in <em>Jour. of Theol. Studies</em> (July, 1906), VII. On the relation of the <em>Didache</em> to the <em>Didascalia Apostolorum</em> and to the <em>Ap. Constitutions</em>, see also FUNK, <em>Die Ap. Const.</em> (Rottenburg, 1891) and his <em>Didasc. et Const. Apost.</em> (Paderborn, 1906). HOLZHEY, <em>Die Abh&auml;ngigkeit der Syr. Didask. von der Didache</em> (Munich, 1898). This list is but an excerpt from the enormous literature since 1884. Bibliography to 1895 in CHEVALIER, <em>Topo-bibliographie</em>; summaries in SCHLECHT, loc. cit., to 1900; in EHRHARD, <em>Altchr.
