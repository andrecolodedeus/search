<h1>The Diocese of Aberdeen</h1>  

<p>(Scotland).

<p>A see that was founded in 1063 at Mortlach by Bl. Beyn. The earliest mention of the old See of Aberdeen is in the charter of the foundation, by the Earl of Buchan, of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/04674b.htm">Deer</a> (c. 1152), which is witnessed by Nectan, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Aberdeen. But the first authentic record of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a> (1157), confirming to Edward, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Aberdeen, the churches of Aberdeen and St. Machar, with the town of Old Aberdeen and other lands. The granite <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was built between 1272 and 1277. Bishop Thomas Spence founded a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> house in 1480, and King's College was founded at Old Aberdeen by Bishop Elphinstone, for eight <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebendaries</a>, chapter, <a href="../cathen/13322a.htm">sacristan</a>, <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organist</a>, and six choristers, in 1505. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was transferred to Old Aberdeen about 1125, and continued there until 1577, having had in that time a list of twenty-nine <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. From 1653, when the Scottish <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were incorporated into a missionary body by the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of the Propaganda</a>, until 1695, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> were governed by prefects-apostolic. Then followed vicars-apostolic until 4 March, 1878, when <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, in the first year of his pontificate, restored the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <em>Ex supremo Apostolatus apice</em>, and Vicar-Apostolic John MacDonald was translated to the restored See of Aberdeen as its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> made Aberdeen one of the four suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13330a.htm">Archbishopric of St. Andrews and Edinburgh</a>, and defined as its territory "the counties of Aberdeen, Kincardine, Banff, Elgin or Moray, Nairn, Ross (except Lewis in the Hebrides), Cromarty, Sutherland, Caithness, the Orkney and Shetland Islands, and that portion of Inverness which lies to the north of a straight line drawn from the most northerly point of Loch Luing to the eastern boundary of the said county of Inverness, where the counties of Aberdeen and Banff join." In 1906, out of a population of over 800,000 there were nearly 4,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; 48 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>; 24 regulars; 57 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and stations; 1 college; 1 industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls; 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> for boys; 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> for girls. There are also <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, Poor Sisters of Nazareth, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters, Religious of the Sacred Heart, and <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>. There have been four Bishops of Aberdeen since the restoration, the present incumbent, the Rt. Rev. &AElig;neas Chisholm, having been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 24 February, 1899. There is a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">Abbey</a> at Fort Augustus, at which the restored <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> met in a <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a>, August, 1886, under the presidency of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of St. Andrews, three hundred and twenty-six years after the downfall of the Faith in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of 1 March, 1559, at <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>, under Archbishop Hamilton, was the last council before this, and that had adjourned after appointing <a href="../cathen/13721b.htm">Septuagesima Sunday</a> of 1560, for the next meeting of the synod. Fort Augustus was raised to the rank of an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, by a brief of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, 12 December, 1882. The munificence of Lord Lovat and other liberal benefactors called it into being.
