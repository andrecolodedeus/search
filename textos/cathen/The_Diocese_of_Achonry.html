<h1>The Diocese of Achonry</h1>  

<p>(Gaelic, <em>Achadh-Chonnaire</em>, Connary's Field).

<p>In <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, suffragan to the <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Archdiocese of Tuam</a>. The village of Achonry occupies a very picturesque situation in the south of the County Sligo. Here St. Finian, who died in 552, established a church and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on some land given him by the prince of the Clann Chonnaire. Over this he placed Nathi O Hara, who had been his pupil in the famous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/04064a.htm">Clonard</a> and is always spoken of in the annals as <em>Cruimthir-Nathi</em>, i.e. the Priest Nathi. In a short <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and its head acquired a remarkable <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was formed (c. 560) of which Nathi is reputed to have been the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, though he may have been only the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot-superior</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> system of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization from the sixth to the twelfth century, which permitted in <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> government such peculiar subordination. He is the <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 9 August. His <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">successors</a> made use of his monastery-church as their <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and traces of it may still be seen. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was formerly sometimes called Leyney from one of its largest and most important baronies, or perhaps because it was coextensive with what is still known as the barony of Leyney. Additions were made to it at different periods until its boundaries were finally fixed in the twelfth century. It now includes some of <a href="../cathen/13190a.htm">Roscommon</a>, a considerable part of <a href="../cathen/10089a.htm">Mayo</a>, and the greater part of Sligo. At the important <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">Synod</a> of <a href="../cathen/08615a.htm">Kells</a>, held in March, 1152, presided over by Cardinal Paparo, and attended by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a>, then <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a>, by twenty other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and by many inferior <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the Diocese of Achonry was represented by its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Melruan O'Ruadhan. Its <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> limits were then fixed, and it was made suffragan to Tuam. From that date the catalogue of its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is less fragmentary. Of the three <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who were members of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, one was Eugene O'Hart, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Achonry. He is described in the records of the Council as a "professor of Theology and a learned and distinguished ecclesiastic", and had been a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> of Sligo Abbey. He took a prominent part in its deliberations, and left on all its members a deep impression of his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and learning. From the death of Dr. O'Hart in 1603, except for a brief interval of four years (1641-45), there was no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> until 1707, and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was governed by vicars-apostolic. Achonry is one of the most <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in the world. The total population, according to the latest <a href="../cathen/03533a.htm">census</a> (1901) is 82,795, of which 2,242 are non-Catholics, so that 97.3 percent of the whole are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Achonry has twenty-two <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, twenty of which have <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> with full canonical <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>; the remaining two are mensal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. There are 51 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and though at one period of its history Achonry was studded with <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>, it has at the present time no <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. There are 7 congregations of religious sisters: 3 of the <a href="../cathen/03609a.htm">Irish Sisters of Charity</a>, 2 of the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, 1 of the Sisters of St. Louis, and 1 of the Marist Sisters. The <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> have a house in Ballaghaderreen and the <a href="../cathen/09749c.htm">Marist Brothers</a> one in Swineford. Full provision is made for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the young. In addition to the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> with five professors there are day <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> under the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> and brothers and 201 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> under <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay</a> teachers. There is besides a boarding-school for young ladies conducted by the Sisters of St. Louis. There are also under the charge of the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> 2 industrial and 7 technical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Since the <a href="../cathen/01095a.htm">accession</a> of Dr. M. Nicholas in 1818, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> resides in Ballaghaderreen. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, a very fine Gothic building, erected at great expense by Dr. Durcan, has been completed by the present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Dr. Lyster, by the addition of a magnificent tower and <a href="../cathen/14220a.htm">spire</a>. Within the last fifty years many new churches, some very beautiful, have been built, old ones renovated, houses supplied for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> established. and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> provided.
