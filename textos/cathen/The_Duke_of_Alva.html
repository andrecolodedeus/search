<h1>The Duke of Alva</h1>  

<p>(FERNANDO ALVAREZ DE TOLEDO)

<p>Born 1508, of one of the most distinguished <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, which boasted descent from the Byzantine emperors; died at Thomar, 12 January, 1582. From his earliest childhood the boy was trained by a severe discipline for his future career as warrior and statesman. In his sixteenth year he took part in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; a year later he was in the siege of Pavia, and in 1527 fought against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. He enjoyed the esteem of the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a>, and played a great role in the numerous <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> in which <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> was involved for half a century. His chief fame rests upon his mission in 1567 to the riotous <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, where the Gueux had created systematic opposition to the Spanish regent, Margaret of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, traditionally accustomed to free government, King Philip, though born a Dutchman, essayed to establish an absolutism such as prevailed in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. He rejected the mild measures proposed by moderate counsellors, and held that a swift punishment should meted out to this rebellious and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> country. At first Philip resolved to go himself to the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, but towards the end of November, 1567, he suddenly informed Margaret of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> that he would send the Duke of Alva to punish the guilty with unbending severity. The "iron duke" was to be the ideal instrument for the execution of this purpose.

<p>The very announcement of Alva's coming spread terror and consternation. Prince William of Orange and other leaders of the Gueux fled to foreign countries. But the popular Counts of Egmond and Hoorne, through blind confidence or reckless <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, resolved to face Alva. On 22 August, Alva, accompanied by a body of select Spanish troops, made his entry into <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>. He immediately appointed a council to condemn without trial those suspected of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and rebellion. On 1 June, 1568, <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> witnessed the simultaneous decapitation of twenty-two noblemen; on 6 June followed the execution of the Counts of Egmond and Hoorne. The "Council of Blood" was the popular designation of Alva's tribunal. The Flemings fled in thousands to <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and Zeeland, where the elements of the rebellion were concentrated under the leadership of the Prince of Orange. In the meantime Alva began a regular campaign in the northern provinces. His victorious troops, whose banner was inscribed with the legend: <em>"Pro lege, rege, grege,"</em> and plundered the cities of Mons, Mechlen, Zutphen, and Naarden, and left them drenched in blood. In triumph, Alva returned to <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>. <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pope Pius V</a> bestowed on him a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> hat and sword, a present heretofore only given to sovereigns. In Antwerp, the governor erected a bronze <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> in his own <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; it represented Alva trampling under his feet two allegorical figures, the nobility and the people. The dictator had proclaimed that the expenses of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> must be borne by the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. In consequence, the resources of the people were drained by taxation. Notwithstanding the protestations of the States-General he introduced the so-called "tax of the one hundredth, twentieth, and tenth penny." This exaction surpassed all bounds. When on 31 July in <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> the twentieth and tenth penny were extorted, traffic and commerce came to a standstill. The <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> people, still for the greater part <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, felt themselves outraged in their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> by the "Council of Blood," and their inborn <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of freedom by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>. When they saw their commerce and industries trammelled by the odious tenth penny tax, the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against the Spanish r&eacute;gime grew so manifest and widespread, that Alva, although victorious on the field of battle, suffered an irremediable moral defeat. The surprising conquest of the little seaport of Brielle by the "Beggars of the Sea" was the inspiration that fanned anew the smouldering embers of the rebellion. Haarlem, after a long siege capitulated to Don Frederic, son of Alva, 12 July, 1573; but this victory was speedily followed by the defeat of Alkmaar, which defended itself so heroically that the popular cry became: "From Alkmaar, victory begins!"

<p>Alva at last realized that his violent measures were fruitless. "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> are against me," he exclaimed in despair. In vain he begged the King to let him retire. His soft-hearted successor, the Duke of Medina Celi, who passed through the country in June, 1572, never really assumed the reins of government but shortly returned to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The 19 October, 1573, Alva was definitively relieved of his office and succeeded by Don Luis of Requesens. He hastened from the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, followed by the curse of its people. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> councillor Viglius testified: <em>"Tristis venit, tristior abiit."</em> Once again in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> he still retained the royal favour, till a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> affair of Don Frederic dragged father and son into disgrace. Alva remained in exile at his castle up to 1580, when the acknowledged power of his iron hand was sought in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. In the short space of three weeks he completely subdued the Portuguese. Dissension broke out once more between Philip and Alva, but the Duke had made himself so powerful that Philip, though suspecting that Alva had enriched himself extraordinarily with the spoils of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and knowing that he refused to account to his King, did not dare raise a hand against the first grandee of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. A short time after he died at Thomar, 12 January, 1582. Alva was, as even Motley in "The Rise of the Dutch Republic" (London, 1868, 9, 336), admits, "the most successful and experienced general of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, or of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, in his day. No man had studied military <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> more deeply, or practiced it more constantly." In sixty years of military service he was never surprised, never defeated. He excelled in slow and prudent tactics, deeming that nothing was so uncertain as victory. He stands amongst the greatest generals of history. Yet his greatness was confined to the battlefield. He lacked the wisdom of governing.

<p>His tyranny, however blameable, was exaggerated by the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of opposing parties. Alva boasted, it is said, that he <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> on the scaffold 18,000 Dutchmen; but his successor, Requesens, estimated his executions at 6,000 (Gachard, Etudes, II, 366). Motley paints him in the blackest colours, allowing in his favour only the excuse "that he was but the blind and fanatically loyal slave of his sovereign" (541). In reality, Alva came to the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> to carry out the royal orders, and save the King's popularity by taking upon himself the odium of the rigorous suppression of the rebellion. He erected his own <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> in <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, not to glorify himself, but to pose as the tyrannous suppressor of the rebellion. In order that Philip might play the role of a bold sovereign, he asked the King to order the demolition of the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> (E. Gossart, Bulletin de l'acad&eacute;mie de Belgique, 1899, 234-244). While we deplore his tyrannous method we must give credit to the duke's loyalty. When his personal dignity and views were touched, he dared defy even his King. He was an ardent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, who fiercely served his religion when he combated <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> with fire and sword, but who, as a child of such troublous times, unwisely chose his measures. Notwithstanding his fanaticism he boldly entered the campaign against <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>, and when the King offered an advantageous peace to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, the Duke exclaimed angrily that submission and timidity did not agree with politics and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Alva, like his King, has been blackened savagely by prejudiced historians. As Maurenbrecher says, the caricatures of both have their origin in the passionate apology for William of Orange. As to Motley's historical work quoted above, Guizot remarks that "M. Motley exhibits in his work both science and passion" (Melanges biograph. et litteraires, Paris, 1808). His judgment of Alva is neither objectively justified nor of definitive value.
