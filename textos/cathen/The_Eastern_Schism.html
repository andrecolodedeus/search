<h1>The Eastern Schism</h1>  

<p>From the time of Diotrephes (<a href="../bible/3jo001.htm#vrs9">3 John 1:9-10</a>) there have been continual <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a>, of which the greater number were in the East. <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> produced a huge <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>; the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> and <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a> still last. However, the Eastern Schism always means that most deplorable quarrel of which the final result is the separation of the vast majority of <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Christians</a> from union with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> that produced the separated, so-called <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">"Orthodox" Church</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Remote preparation of the schism</h2>

<p>The great Eastern Schism must not be conceived as the result of only one definite quarrel. It is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that after centuries of perfect peace, suddenly on account of one dispute, nearly half of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> fell away. Such an event would be unparalleled in history, at any rate, unless there were some great <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and in this quarrel there was no <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> at first, nor has there ever been a hopeless disagreement about the Faith. It is a case, perhaps the only prominent case, of a pure <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, of a breach of intercommunion caused by <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and bad feeling, not by a rival <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. It would be inconceivable then that hundreds of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should suddenly break away from union with their chief, if all had gone smoothly before. The great <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> is rather the result of a very gradual process. Its remote causes must be sought centuries before there was any suspicion of their final effect. There was a series of temporary <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a> that loosened the bond and prepared the way. The two great breaches, those of <a href="../cathen/12043b.htm">Photius</a> and <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Michael Caerularius</a>, which are remembered as the origin of the present state of things, were both healed up afterwards. Strictly speaking, the present <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> dates from the Eastern repudiation of the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> (in 1472). So although the names of Photius and <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Caerularius</a> are justly associated with this disaster, inasmuch as their quarrels are the chief elements in the story, it must not be imagined that they were the sole, the first, or the last authors of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. If we group the story around their names we must explain the earlier causes that prepared for them, and note that there were temporary reunions later.

<p>The first cause of all was the gradual estrangement of East and West. To a great extent this estrangement was inevitable. The East and West grouped themselves around different centres &mdash; at any rate as immediate centres &mdash; used different rites and spoke different languages. We must distinguish the position of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as visible head of all <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> from his place as <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the West. The position, sometimes now advanced by anti-papal controversialists, and that all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are equal in <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, was utterly unknown in the early Church. From the very beginning we find a graduated <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, exarchs, and <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a>. We find, too, from the beginning the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> inherits the dignity of the founder of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, that, therefore, the successor of an Apostle has special <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges. This graduated <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> is important as explaining the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> position. He was not the one immediate superior of each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; he was the chief of an elaborate organization, as it were the apex of a carefully graduated pyramid. The consciousness of the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> probably would have been that the heads of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> were the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>; then further he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> quite well that the chief patriarch sat at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. However, the immediate head of each part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was its patriarch. After Chalcedon (451) we must count five <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a>: <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Constantinople, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.

<p>The difference between the East and West then was in the first place that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the West was not only supreme pontiff, but also the local patriarch. He represented to <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Christians</a> a remote and foreign authority, the last court of appeal, for very serious questions, after their own <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> had been found incapable of settling them; but to his own Latins in the West he was the immediate head, the authority immediately over their <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, the first court of appeal to their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. So all loyalty in the West went direct to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was the Mother Church in many senses, it was by missioners sent out from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> that the local <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Churches</a> had been founded. The loyalty of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Christians</a> on the other hand went first to his own patriarch, so there was here always a danger of divided allegiance &mdash; if the patriarch had a quarrel with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> &mdash; such as would have been inconceivable in the West. Indeed, the falling away of so many hundreds of Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, of so many millions of simple <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, is explained sufficiently by the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>. If the four Eastern <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> agreed upon any course it was practically a foregone conclusion that their <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> would follow them and that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and people would follow the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. So the very organization of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in some sort already prepared the ground for a contrast (which might become a rivalry) between the first patriarch in the West with his vast following of Latins on the one side and the Eastern <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> with their subjects on the other.

<p>Further points that should be noticed are the differences of rite and language. The question of rite follows that of <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>; it made the distinction obvious to the simplest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. A Syrian, Greek or <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> would, perhaps, not understand much about canon law as affecting <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>; he could not fail to notice that a travelling <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> celebrated the Holy Mysteries in a way that was very strange, and that stamped him as a (perhaps suspicious) foreigner. In the West, the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> was first affecting, then supplanting, all others, and in the East the Byzantine Rite was gradually obtaining the same position. So we have the germ of two unities, Eastern and Western. Undoubtedly both sides <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that other rites were equally legitimate ways of celebrating the same mysteries, but the difference made it difficult to say <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> together. We see that this point was an important one from the number of accusations against purely ritual matters brought by <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Caerularius</a> when he looked for grounds of quarrel.



<p>Even the detail of language was an element of separation. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the East was never entirely hellenized as the West was latinized. Nevertheless, Greek did become to a great extent the international language in the East. In the Eastern councils all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> talk Greek. So again we have the same two unities, this time in language &mdash; a practically Greek East and an entirely Latin West. It is difficult to conceive this detail as a cause of estrangement, but it is undoubtedly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that many misunderstandings arose and grew, simply because people could not understand one another. For during the time when these disputes arose, hardly anyone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> a foreign language. It was not till the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> that the age of convenient grammars and dictionaries arose. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory I</a> (d. 1604) had been apocrisary at Constantinople, but he does not seem to have learned Greek; <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Pope Vigilius</a> (540-55) spent eight unhappy years there and yet never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the language. Photius was the profoundest scholar of his age, yet he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no Latin. When <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> (1048-54) wrote in Latin to Peter III of Antioch, Peter had to send the letter to Constantinople to find out what it was about. Such cases occur continually and confuse all the relations between East and West. At councils the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> addressed the assembled fathers in Latin and no one understood them; the council deliberated in Greek and the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> wondered what was going on. So there arose suspicion on both sides. Interpreters had to be called in; could their versions be trusted? The Latins especially were profoundly suspicious of Greek craft in this matter. Legates were asked to sign documents they did not understand on the strength of assurances that there was nothing really compromising in them. And so little made so much difference. The famous case, long afterwards, of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of Florence and the forms <em>kath on tropon, quemadmodum</em>, shows how much confusion the use of two languages may cause.

<p>These causes then combined to produce two halves of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, an Eastern and a Western half, each distinguished in various ways from the other. They are certainly not sufficient to account for a separation of those halves; only we notice that already there was a consciousness of two entities, the first marking of a line of division, through which rivalry, jealousy, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> might easily cut a separation.
<h2 id="section2">Causes of estrangement</h2>

<p>The rivalry and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> arose from several causes. Undoubtedly the first, the root of all the quarrel, was the advance of the See of Constantinople. We have seen that four Eastern <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a> were to some extent contrasted to the one great Western unity. Had there remained four such unities in the East, nothing further need have followed. What accentuated the contrast and made it a rivalry was the gradual assumption of authority over the other three by the patriarch of Constantinople. It was Constantinople that bound together the East into one body, uniting it against the West. It was the persistent attempt of the emperor's patriarch to become a kind of Eastern <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, as nearly as possible equal to his Western prototype, that was the real source of all the trouble. On the one hand, union under Constantinople really made a kind of rival Church that could be opposed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; on the other hand, through all the career of advancement of the Byzantine <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> they found only one real hindrance, the persistent opposition of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. The emperor was their friend and chief ally always. It was, indeed, the emperor's policy of centralization that was responsible for the scheme of making the See of Constantinople a centre. The other <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> who were displaced were not dangerous opponents. Weakened by the endless <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> quarrels, having lost most of their flocks, then reduced to an abject state by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> conquest, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and Antioch could not prevent the growth of Constantinople. Indeed, eventually, they accepted their degradation willingly and came to be idle ornaments of the new patriarch's Court. <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> too was hampered by <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a> and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a> and was itself a new <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, having only the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the last see of the five.

<p>On the other hand, at every step in the advancement of Constantinople there was always the opposition of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. When the new see got its titular <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04308a.htm">First Council of Constantinople</a> (381, can.3), <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> refused to accept the canon (she was not represented at the council); when Chalcedon in 451 turned this into a real <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> (can. 28) the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> and then the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself refused to acknowledge what had been done; when, intoxicated by their quick advancement, the successors of the little suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had once obeyed Heraclea assumed the insolent title "oecumenical patriarch", it was again a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of Old <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> who sternly rebuked their arrogance. We can understand that jealousy and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> rankled in the minds of the new <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, that they were willing to throw off altogether an authority which was in their way at every step. That the rest of the East joined them in their rebellion was the natural result of the authority they had succeeded in usurping over the other Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. So we arrive at the essential consideration in this question. The Eastern Schism was not a movement arising in all the East; it was not a quarrel between two large bodies; it was essentially the rebellion of one see, Constantinople, which by the emperor's favour had already acquired such influence that it was able unhappily to drag the other <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> into <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> with it.

<p>We have already seen that the suffragans of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> would naturally follow their chiefs. If then Constantinople had stood alone her <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> would have mattered comparatively little. What made the situation so serious was that the rest of the East eventually sided with her. That followed from her all too successful assumption of the place of chief see in the East. So the advance of Constantinople was doubly the cause of the great <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. It brought her into conflict with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and made the Byzantine patriarch almost inevitably the enemy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; at the same time it gave him such a position that his enmity meant that of all the East.

<p>This being so, we must remember how entirely unwarrantable, novel, and uncanonical the advance of Constantinople was. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was not Apostolic, had no glorious traditions, no reason whatever for its usurpation of the first place in the East, but an accident of secular politics. The first historical <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Byzantium was Metrophanes (315-25); he was not even a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, he was the lowest in rank a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> could be, a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/07242b.htm">Heraclea</a>. That is all his successors ever would have been, they would have had no power to influence anyone, had not Constantine chosen their city for his capital. All through their progress they made no pretense of founding their claims on anything but the fact that they were now <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the political capital. It was as the emperor's <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, as functionaries of the imperial Court, that they rose to the second place in <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. The legend of St. Andrew founding their see was a late afterthought; it is now abandoned by all scholars. The claim of Constantinople was always frankly the purely Erastian one that as Caesar could establish his capital where he liked, so could he, the civil governor, give <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rank in the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> to any see he liked.

<p>The 28th canon of Chalcedon says so in so many words. Constantinople has become the New Rome, therefore its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is to have like <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to that of the patriarch of Old <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and to be second after him. It only needed a shade more insolence to claim that the emperor could transfer all <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city where he held his court.

<p>Let it be always remembered that the rise of Constantinople, its jealousy of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, its unhappy influence over all the East is a pure piece of Erastianism, a shameless surrender of the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to Caesar. And nothing can be less stable than to establish <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> on the basis of secular politics. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in 1453 cut away the foundation of Byzantine <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>. There is now no emperor and no Court to justify the oecumenical patriarch's position. If we were to apply <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> the principle on which he rests, he would sink back to the lowest place and the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> would reign at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, London, New York. Meanwhile the old and really canonical principle of the superiority of Apostolic sees remains untouched by political changes. Apart from the Divine origin of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, the advance of Constantinople was a gross violation of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the Apostolic Sees of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and Antioch. We need not wonder that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, although their first place was not questioned, resented this disturbance of ancient <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> of the imperial <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<p>Long before Photius there had been <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a> between Constantinople and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, all of them healed up in time, but naturally all tending to weaken the sense of essential unity. From the beginning of the See of Constantinople to the great <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in 867 the list of these temporary breaches of communion is a formidable one. There were fifty-five years of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> (343-98) during the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> troubles, eleven because of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom's</a> deposition (404-15), thirty-five years of the <a href="../cathen/01082a.htm">Acacian</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> (484-519), forty-one years of <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelite</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> (640-81), sixty-one years because of <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclasm</a>. So of these 544 years (323-867) no less than 203 were spent by Constantinople in a state of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. We notice too that in every one of these quarrels Constantinople was on the wrong side; by the consent of the Orthodox, too, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in all stood out for right. And already we see that the influence of the emperor (who naturally always supported his court patriarch) in most cases dragged a great number of other Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> into the same <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>.
<h2 id="section3">Photius and Caerularius</h2>

<p>It was natural that the great <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a>, which are immediately responsible for the present state of things, should be local quarrels of Constantinople. Neither was in any sense a general grievance of the East. There was neither time any reason why other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should join with Constantinople in the quarrel against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, except that already they had learned to look to the imperial city for orders. The quarrel of Photius was a gross defiance of lawful church order. Ignatius was the rightful <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> without any question; he had reigned peaceably for eleven years. Then he refused Communion to a man guilty of open incest (857). But that man was the regent Bardas, so the Government professed to depose Ignatius and intruded Photius into his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Pope Nicholas I</a> had no quarrel against the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>; he had no quarrel against the Byzantine see. He stood out for the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the lawful <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Both Ignatius and Photius had formally appealed to him. It was only when Photius found that he had lost his case that he and the Government preferred <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> to submission (867). It is even <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> how far this time there was any general Eastern <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> at all. In the council that restored Ignatius (869) the other <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> declared that they had at once accepted the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> former verdict.

<p>But Photius had formed an anti-Roman party which was never afterwards dissolved. The effect of his quarrel, though it was so purely personal, though it was patched up when Ignatius died, and again when Photius fell, was to gather to a head all the old jealousy of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at Constantinople. We see this throughout the Photian Schism. The mere question of that usurper's pretended <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> does not account for the outburst of enmity against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, against everything Western and Latin that we notice in government documents, in Photius's letters, in the Acts of his synod in 879, in all the attitude of his party. It is rather the rancour of centuries bursting out on a poor pretext; this fierce resentment against Roman interference comes from men who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of old that <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is the one hindrance to their plans and ambitions. Moreover, Photius gave the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> a new and powerful weapon. The cry of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was raised often enough at all times; it never failed to arouse popular indignation. But it had not yet occurred to any one to accuse all the West of being steeped in pernicious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Hitherto it had been a question of resenting the use of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority in isolated cases. This new <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> carried the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> into the enemy's camp with a vengeance. Photius's six charges are silly enough, so silly that one wonders that so great a scholar did not think of something cleverer, at least in appearance. But they changed the situation to the Eastern advantage. When Photius calls the Latins "liars, fighters against God, forerunners of Antichrist", it is no longer a question merely of abusing one's <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superiors. He now assumes a more effective part; he is the champion of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, indignant against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.

<p>After Photius, John Bekkos says there was "perfect peace" between East and West. But the peace was only on the surface. Photius's cause did not die. It remained latent in the party he left, the party that still <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> the West, that was ready to break the union again at the first pretext, that remembered and was ready to revive this charge of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> against Latins. Certainly from the time of Photius <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and scorn of Latins was an inheritance of the mass of the Byzantine <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. How deeply rooted and far-spread it was, is shown by the absolutely gratuitous outburst 150 years later under <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Michael Caerularius</a> (1043-58). For this time there was not even the shadow of a pretext. No one had disputed <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Caerularius's</a> right as patriarch; the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had not interfered with him in any way at all. And suddenly in 1053 he sends off a declaration of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, then shuts up the Latin churches at Constantinople, hurls a string of wild accusations, and shows in every possible way that he wants a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, apparently for the mere pleasure of not being in communion with the West. He got his wish. After a series of wanton aggressions, unparalleled in <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, after he had begun by striking the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> name from his <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>, the Roman <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him (16 July, 1054). But still there was no <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a general <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a>, still less of all the East. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> carefully provided against that in their <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. They acknowledged that the emperor (Constantine IX, who was excessively annoyed at the whole quarrel), the Senate, and the majority of the inhabitants of the city were "most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>". They <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Caerularius</a>, Leo of <a href="../cathen/01103b.htm">Achrida</a>, and their adherents.

<p>This quarrel, too, need no more have produced a permanent state of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> than the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of any other contumacious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The real tragedy is that gradually all the other Eastern <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> took sides with <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Caerularius</a>, obeyed him by striking the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> name from their <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>, and chose of their own accord to share his <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. At first they do not seem to have wanted to do so. John III of Antioch certainly refused to go into <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> at <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Caerularius's</a> bidding. But, eventually, the habit they had acquired of looking to Constantinople for orders <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> too strong. The emperor (not Constantine IX, but his successor) was on the side of his patriarch and they had learned too well to consider the emperor as their over-lord in spiritual matters too. Again, it was the usurped authority of Constantinople, the Erastianism of the East that turned a personal quarrel into a great <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. We see, too, how well Photius's <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of calling Latins <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> had been learned. <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Caerularius</a> had a list, a longer and even more futile one, of such accusations. His points were different from those of Photius; he had forgotten the <em>Filioque</em>, and had discovered a new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in our use of azyme bread. But the actual accusations mattered little at any time, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that had been found so useful was that of declaring that we are impossible because we are <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. It was offensive and it gave the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> leaders the chance of assuming a most effective pose, as defenders of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith.
<h2 id="section4">After Caerularius</h2>

<p>In a sense the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> was now complete. What had been from the beginning two portions of the same Church, what had become two entities ready to be divided, were now two rival Churches. Yet, just as there had been <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a> before Photius, so there have been reunions after <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Caerularius</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09476c.htm">Second Council of Lyons</a> in 1274 and again the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> in 1439 both arrived at a reunion that people hoped would close the breach for ever. Unhappily, neither reunion lasted, neither had any solid basis on the Eastern side. The anti-Latin party, foreshadowed long ago, formed and organized by Photius, had under <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Caerularius</a> become the whole "Orthodox" Church. This process had been a gradual one, but it was now complete. At first the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> Churches (Russia, <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servia</a>, <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, etc.) saw no reason why they should break communion with the West because a patriarch of Constantinople was angry with a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. But the habit of looking to the capital of the empire eventually affected them too. They used the Byzantine Rite, were Easterns; so they settled on the Eastern side. <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Caerularius</a> had managed cleverly to represent his cause as that of the East; it seemed (most unjustifiably) that it was a question of <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> versus Latins.

<p>At Lyons, and again at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, the reunion (on their side) was only a political expedient of the Government. The emperor wanted Latins to fight for him against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. So he was prepared to concede anything &mdash; till the danger was over. It is clear that on these occasions the religious motive moved only the Western side. We had nothing to gain; we wanted nothing from them. The Latins had everything to offer, they were prepared to give their help. All they wanted in return was that an end should be made of the lamentable and <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> spectacle of a divided <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. For the religious motive the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> cared nothing; or rather, religion to them meant the continuation of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. They had called us <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> so often that they had begun to believe it. Reunion was an unpleasant and humiliating condition in order that a <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frank</a> army might come and protect them. The common people had been so well drilled in their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of Azymites and creed-tamperers, that their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for what they thought Orthodoxy prevailed over their fear of the Turk. "Rather the turban of the Sultan that the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a> of the Pope" expressed their mind exactly. When the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had signed the decrees of reunion came back, each time they were received with a storm of indignation as betrayers of the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Each time the reunion was broken almost as soon as it was made. The last act of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> was when Dionysius I of Constantinople (1467-72) summoned a synod and formally repudiated the union (1472). Since then there has been no intercommunion; a vast "Orthodox" Church exists, apparently satisfied with being in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> whom it still recognizes as the first patriarch of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>.
<h2 id="section5">Reasons of the present schism</h2>

<p>In this deplorable story we notice the following points. It is easier to understand how a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> continues than how it began. Schisms are easily made; they are enormously difficult to heal. The religious <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> is always conservative; there is always a strong tendency to continue the existing state of things. At first the schismatics were reckless innovators; then with the lapse of centuries their cause seems to be the old one; it is the Faith of the Fathers. <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Christians</a> especially have this conservative <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> strongly. They fear that reunion with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> would mean a betrayal of the old Faith, of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, to which they have clung so heroically during all these centuries. One may say that the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> continues mainly through force of inertia.

<p>In its origin we must distinguish between the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> tendency and the actual occasion of its outburst. But the reason of both has gone now. The tendency was mainly jealousy caused by the rise of the See of Constantinople. That progress is over long ago. The last three centuries Constantinople has lost nearly all the broad lands she once acquired. There is nothing the modern <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Christian</a> resents more than any assumption of authority by the oecumenical patriarch outside his diminished <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. The Byzantine see has long been the plaything of the Turk, wares that he sold to the highest bidder. Certainly now this pitiful dignity is no longer a reason for the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of nearly 100,000,000 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Still less are the immediate causes of the breach active. The question of the respective <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of Ignatius and Photius leaves even the Orthodox cold after eleven centuries; and <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Caerularius's</a> ambitions and insolence may well be buried with him. Nothing then remains of the original causes.

<p>There is not really any question of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> involved. It is not a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, but a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of Florence made every possible concession to their feelings. There is no real reason why they should not sign that <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> now. They deny <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07674d.htm">Immaculate Conception</a>, they quarrel over <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> by the words of institution, the procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, in each case misrepresenting the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> to which they object. It is not difficult to show that on all these points their own Fathers are with those of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, which asks them only to return to the old teaching of their own <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>That is the right attitude towards the Orthodox always. They have a horror of being latinized, of betraying the old Faith. One must always insist that there is no <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of latinizing them, that the old Faith is not incompatible with, but rather demands union with the chief see which their Fathers obeyed. In canon law they have nothing to change except such abuses as the sale of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> and the Erastianism that their own better <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> deplore. <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">Celibacy</a>, azyme bread, and so on are Latin customs that no one thinks of forcing on them. They need not add the <em>Filioque</em> to the Creed; they will always keep their venerable rite untouched. Not a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> need be moved, hardly a feast (except that of St. Photius on 6 Feb.) altered. All that is asked of them is to come back to where their Fathers stood, to treat <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, Basil, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> treated her. It is not Latins, it is they who have left the Faith of their Fathers. There is no humiliation in retracing one's steps when one has wandered down a mistaken road because of long-forgotten personal quarrels. They too must see how disastrous to the common cause is the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> of the division. They too must wish to put an end to so crying an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And if they really wish it the way need not be difficult. For, indeed, after nine centuries of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> we may realize on both sides that it is not only the greatest it is also the most superfluous <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>.
