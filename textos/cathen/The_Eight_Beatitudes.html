<div id="springfield2">
<h1>The Eight Beatitudes</h1>  

<p>The solemn <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> (<em>beatitudines, benedictiones</em>) which mark the opening of the Sermon on the Mount, the very first of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> in the <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs3">Gospel of St. Matthew (5:3-10)</a>.

<p>Four of them occur again in a slightly different form in the <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#vrs22">Gospel of St. Luke (6:22)</a>, likewise at the beginning of a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermon</a>, and running parallel to <a href="../bible/mat005.htm">Matthew 5</a>-<a href="../bible/mat007.htm">7</a>, if not another version of the same. And here they are illustrated by the opposition of the four <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">curses</a> (<a href="../bible/luk006.htm#vrs24">24-26</a>).

<p>The fuller account and the more prominent place given the Beatitudes in <a href="../cathen/10056b.htm">St. Matthew</a> are quite in accordance with the scope and the tendency of the First Gospel, in which the spiritual character of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Messianic kingdom</a> &#151; the paramount <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the Beatitudes &#151; is consistently put forward, in sharp contrast with <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> prejudices. The very peculiar form in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> proposed His <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> make them, perhaps, the only example of His sayings that may be styled poetical &#151; the <a href="../cathen/11473a.htm">parallelism</a> of thought and expression, which is the most striking feature of <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">Biblical</a> poetry, being unmistakably clear.

<p>The text of <a href="../cathen/10056b.htm">St. Matthew</a> runs as follows: <ul><li>Blessed are the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>: for theirs is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. (<em><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs5">Verse 3</a></em>) <li>Blessed are the meek: for they shall possess the land. (<em><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs4">Verse 4</a></em>) <li>Blessed are they who mourn: for they shall be comforted. (<em><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs5">Verse 5</a></em>) <li>Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: for they shall have their fill. (<em><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs6">Verse 6</a></em>) <li>Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. (<em><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs7">Verse 7</a></em>) <li>Blessed are the clean of heart: for they shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. (<em><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs8">Verse 8</a></em>) <li>Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. (<em><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs9">Verse 9</a></em>) <li>Blessed are they that suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice'</a> sake, for theirs is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. (<em><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs10">Verse 10</a></em>) </ul>
<h2>Textual criticism</h2>

<p>As regards <a href="../cathen/04497a.htm">textual criticism</a>, the passage offers no serious difficulty. Only in <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs9">verse 9</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> and many other ancient authorities omit the pronoun <em>autoi, ipsi</em>; probably a merely accidental ommission. There is room, too, for serious critical <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, whether <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs5">verse 5</a> should not be placed before <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs4">verse 4</a>. Only the etymological connection, which in the original is supposed to have existed between the "poor" and the "meek", makes us prefer the order of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>.
<h3>First beatitude</h3>

<p>The word <em>poor</em> seems to represent an Aramaic <em>'&aacute;ny&acirc;</em> (Hebrew <em>'an&icirc;</em>), bent down, afflicted, miserable, poor; while <em>meek</em> is rather a synonym from the same root, <em>'&aacute;nwan</em> (Hebrew <em>'&aacute;naw</em>), bending oneself down, humble, meek, gentle. Some scholars would attach to the former word also the sense of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>; others think of "beggars before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" humbly acknowledging their need of Divine help. But the opposition of "rich" (<a href="../bible/luk006.htm#vrs24">Luke 6:24</a>) points especially to the common and obvious meaning, which, however, ought not to be confined to economical need and distress, but may comprehend the whole of the painful condition of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>: their low estate, their social dependence, their defenceless exposure to <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> from the rich and the mighty. Besides the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, the promise of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">heavenly kingdom</a> is not bestowed on the actual external condition of such poverty. The <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> ones are the poor "in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>", who by their <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> are ready to bear for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake this painful and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> condition, even though at present they be actually <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">rich</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>; while on the other hand, the really <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man may fall short of this poverty "in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>".
<h3>Second beatitude</h3>

<p>Inasmuch as poverty is a state of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> subjection, the "poor in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>", come near to the "meek", the subject of the second <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>. The <em>anawim</em>, they who humbly and meekly bend themselves down before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, shall "inherit the land" and possess their inheritance in peace. This is a phrase taken from <a href="../bible/psa036.htm#vrs11">Psalm 36:11</a>, where it refers to the Promised Land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, but here in the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it is of course but a symbol of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of Heaven</a>, the spiritual realm of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiah</a>. Not a few interpreters, however, understand "the earth". But they overlook the original meaning of <a href="../bible/psa036.htm#vrs11">Psalm 36:11</a>, and unless, by a far-fetched expedient, they take the earth also to be a symbol of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Messianic kingdom</a>, it will be hard to explain the possession of the earth in a satisfactory way.
<h3>Third beatitude</h3>

<p>The "mourning" in the Third Beatitude is in <a href="../bible/luk016.htm#vrs25">Luke (6:25)</a> opposed to laughter and similar frivolous worldly joy. Motives of mourning are not to be drawn from the miseries of a life of poverty, abjection, and subjection, which are the very <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> of <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs3">verse 3</a>, but rather from those miseries from which the pious man is suffering in himself and in others, and most of all the tremendous might of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> throughout the world. To such mourners the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a> carries the comfort of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly kingdom</a>, "the consolation of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>" (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#vrs25">Luke 2:25</a>) foretold by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and especially by the <a href="../bible/isa011.htm">Book of Consolation of Isaias (11-16)</a>. Even the later <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> knew the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiah</a> by the name of <em>Menahhem</em>, Consoler. These three <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>, poverty, abjection, and subjection are a commendation of what nowadays are called the passive <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">abstinence</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">endurace</a>, and the Eighth Beatitude (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs10">verse 10</a>) leads us back again to the teaching.
<h3>Fourth beatitude</h3>

<p>The others, however, demand a more active behaviour. First of all, "hunger and thirst" after <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: a strong and continuous desire of progress in <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">religious and moral perfection</a>, the reward of which will be the very fulfilment of the desire, the continuous growth in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>.
<h3>Fifth beatitude</h3>

<p>From this interior desire a further step should be taken to acting to the works of "mercy", corporal and spiritual. Through these the merciful will obtain the Divine mercy of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Messianic kingdom</a>, in this life and in the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">final judgment</a>. The wonderful fertility of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in works and institutions of corporal and spiritual mercy of every kind shows the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetical</a> sense, not to say the creative power, of this simple word of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Divine Teacher</a>.
<h3>Sixth beatitude</h3>

<p>According to <a href="../bible/index.html">biblical</a> terminology, "cleanness of heart" (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs8">verse 8</a>) cannot exclusively be found in interior <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, nor even, as many scholars propose, in a genral purity of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, as opposed to the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levitical</a>, or legal, purity required by the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>. At least the proper place of such a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> does not seem to be between mercy (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs7">verse 7</a>) and peacemaking (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs9">verse 9</a>), nor after the apparently more far-reaching <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of hunger and thirst after <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. But frequently in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a> and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testaments</a> (<a href="../bible/gen020.htm#vrs5">Genesis 20:5</a>; <a href="../bible/job033.htm#vrs3">Job 33:3</a>, <a href="../bible/psa023.htm#vrs4">Psalms 23:4 (24:4)</a> and <a href="../bible/psa072.htm#vrs1">72:1 (73:1)</a>; <a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#vrs5">1 Timothy 1:5</a>; <a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#vrs22">2 Timothy 2:22</a>) the "pure heart" is the simple and sincere <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, the "single eye" of <a href="../bible/mat006.htm#vrs22">Matthew 6:22</a>, and thus opposed to the unavowed by-ends of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#vrs1">Matthew 6:1-6</a>, <a href="../bible/mat006.htm#vrs16">16-18</a>; <a href="../bible/mat007.htm#vrs15">7:15</a>; <a href="../bible/mat023.htm#vrs5">23:5-7, 14</a>) This "single eye" or "pure heart" is most of all required in the <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a> (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs7">verse 7</a>) and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs9">verse 9</a>) in behalf of one's neighbor. And it stands to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> that the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, promised to this continuous looking for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, should consist of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">supernatural "seeing" of God Himself</a>, the last aim and end of the heavenly kingdom in its completion.
<h3>Seventh beatitude</h3>

<p>The "peacemakers" (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs9">verse 9</a>) are those who not only live in peace with others but moreover do their best to preserve peace and friendship among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> and between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and to restore it when it has been disturbed. It is on account of this godly work, "an imitating of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" as <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a> styles it, that they shall be called the sons of God, "children of your Father who is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs45">Matthew 5:45</a>).
<h3>Eighth beatitude</h3>

<p>When after all this the pious <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are repaid with ingratitude and even "persecution" (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs10">verse 10</a>) it will be but a new <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, "for theirs is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>."

<p>So, by an inclusion, not uncommon in <a href="../cathen/12174b.htm">biblical poetry</a>, the last <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> goes back to the first and the second. The pious, whose sentiments and desires whose works and sufferings are held up before us, shall be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> by their share in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Messianic kingdom</a>, here and <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">hereafter</a>. And viewed in the intermediate verses seem to express, in partial images of the one <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">endless beatitude</a>, the same possession of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. The eight conditions required constitute the fundamental <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a>, the very pith and marrow of <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a>. For its depth and breadth of thought, and its practical bearing on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life, the passage may be put on a level with the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, and it surpassed both in its poetical beauty of structure.
