<h1>The Evangelical Alliance</h1>  

<p>An association of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> belonging to various <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> founded in 1846, whose object, as declared in a resolution passed at the first meeting, is "to enable <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to realize in themselves and to exhibit to others that a living and everlasting union binds all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> believers together in the fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>" (Report of the Proceedings of the First General Conference). The points of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, which the members accept as being the substance of the Gospel, are contained in a document adopted at the first conference and known as the Basis. They are nine in number: <ol> <li>The <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">Divine inspiration</a>, authority, and sufficiency of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>; <li>the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of private judgment in the interpretation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>; <li>the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">unity of the Godhead</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity of Persons</a> therein; <li>the utter depravity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in consequence of the fall; <li>the Incarnation of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, His work of atonement for sinners, and his mediatorial intercession and reign; <li>the justification of the sinner by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone; <li>the work of the Holy Spirit in the conversion and sanctification of the sinner; <li>the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a>, the judgment of the world by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, with the eternal blessedness of the righteous and the eternal punishment of the wicked; <li>the Divine institution of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ministry, and the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> and perpetuity of the ordinances of Baptism and the Lord's Supper. </ol> "It being, however, distinctly declared that this brief summary is not to be regarded, in any formal or <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> sense, as a creed or confession, nor the adoption of it as involving an assumption of the right authoritatively to define the limits of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> brotherhood, but simply as an indication of the class of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom it is desirable to embrace within the Alliance. In this Alliance, it is also distinctly stated that no compromise of the views of any member, or sanction of those of others, on the points wherein they differ, is either required or expected; but that all are held free as before to maintain and advocate their religious convictions, with due forbearance and brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. It is not contemplated that the Alliance should assume or aim at the character of a new <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization, claiming and exercising the functions of a <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>. Its simple and comprehensive object, it is strongly felt, may be successfully promoted without interfering with, or disturbing the order of, any branch of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> to which its members may respectively belong.

<p>The Alliance thus lays claim to no <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> or legislative authority. In a pamphlet issued by the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> itself this feature is thus explained: "Then it is an <em>Alliance</em>&mdash;not a union of Church organizations, much less an attempt to secure an outward uniformity&mdash;but the members of the Alliance are <em>allies</em>: they belong to different <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> bodies&mdash;yet all of the <em>One</em> Church. They are of different nations as well as of many <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>&mdash;yet all holding the Head, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>. <em>Unum corpus sumus in Christo.</em> We are one body in Christ&mdash;banded together for common purposes, and to manifest the real unity which underlies our great variety. We are all free to hold our own views in regard to subsidiary matters, but all adhere to the cardinal principles of the Alliance as set forth in its Basis."

<p>The Alliance arose at a time when the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of unity was much before men's <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a>. During the years that witnessed the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/11370a.htm">Oxford Movement</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a>, there progressed a movement in favour of union among men whose sympathies were diametrically opposed to those of the Tractarians, but who in their own way longed for a healing of the divisions and differences among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. In 1842 the <a href="../cathen/13627a.htm">Presbyterian Church of Scotland</a> tried, though without success, to establish relations with other <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> bodies. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the progress of the <a href="../cathen/11370a.htm">Tractarian Movement</a> led many distinguished Evangelical <a href="../cathen/11095b.htm">Nonconformists</a> to desire "a great confederation of men of all Churches who were loyal in their attachment to Evangelical <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> in order to defend the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>" (Dale, History of Eng. Congregationalism, 637). At the annual assembly of the Congregational Union held in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, May, 1842, John Angell James (1785-1859), minister of Craven Chapel, Bayswater, London, proposed the scheme that ultimately developed into the Evangelical Alliance. He asked: "Is it not in the power of this Union to bring about by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> blessing, a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Evangelical Union of the whole body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> faithful followers who have at any rate adopted the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> principle? &hellip; Let us only carry out the principle of a great <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Union and we may yet have representatives from all bodies of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant Christians</a> to be found within the circle of our own United Empire" (Congregational Magazine, 1842, 435-6). The first definite step towards this was taken by Mr. Patton, an American minister, who proposed a general conference of delegates from various bodies, with the result that a preliminary meeting was held at <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a> in October, 1845, at which the basis of such a conference was arranged. On 10 Aug., 1846, at a meeting of eight hundred delegates, representing fifty <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>, held in the Freemasons Hall, London, the Evangelical Alliance was founded. All who would accept the Basis were eligible as members, and the representatives of the various nations were recommended to form national organizations or branches, of which the British Organization, formed in 1846, was the first. These organizations were independent of one another and were at liberty to carry on their work in such a manner as should be most in accordance with the peculiar circumstances of each district. They have been formed in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkey</a>, <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>, <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and several missionary countries. The French national branch abandoned the Basis in 1854 and substituted for it a wider form of a <a href="../cathen/15154b.htm">Unitarian</a> character. The Alliance meets and acts as a whole only in the international and general conferences, which are held from time to time. The first of these was held in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 1851, and has been succeeded by others as follows: <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1855; Berlin, 1857; Geneva, 1861; Amsterdam, 1867; New York, 1873; Basle, 1879; Copenhagen, 1884; Florence, 1891; London, 1896 (Celebration of the Jubilee); London, 1907, on which occasion the Diamond Jubilee of the Alliance was celebrated.

<p>These international conventions are regarded as of special value in the promotion of the aims of the Alliance. Another matter to which much importance is attached is the annual "Universal Week of Prayer", observed the first complete week in January of each year since 1846. At this time the Alliance invites all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to join in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, the programme being prepared by representatives of all <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> and printed in many different languages. The relief of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> is another department of work in which the Alliance claims to have accomplished much good. Finally, in 1905, the Alliance Bible School was founded with headquarters at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, under the direction of Pastor K&ouml;hler and Herr Warns, "to place before the students the history and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> in accordance with its own teaching". The reports of the conferences claim considerable success for these various works, a claim which cannot here be investigated. From its principles the Evangelical Alliance is necessarily opposed to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and authority of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, while sympathizing with the desire for union among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, realize that the unity by which we are made one in Christ is not to be won by such methods. The motto of the Alliance is <em>Unum corpus sumus in Christo.</em>
