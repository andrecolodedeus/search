<h3 id="IA">The problem stated</h3>

<h4 id="IAa">Formal anti-theism</h4>

<p>Had the Theist merely to face a blank <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">Atheistic</a> denial of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> existence, his task would he comparatively a light one. Formal dogmatic <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">Atheism</a> is self-refuting, and has never <em>de facto</em> won the reasoned assent of any considerable number of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Nor can <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">Polytheism</a>, however easily it may take hold of the popular <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, ever satisfy the mind of a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. But there are several varieties of what may be described as virtual <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">Atheism</a> which cannot be dismissed so summarily.

<p>There is the <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnosticism</a>, for instance, of Herbert Spencer, which, while admitting the rational necessity of postulating the <a href="../cathen/01060c.htm">Absolute</a> or Unconditioned behind the relative and conditioned objects of our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> declares that Absolute to be altogether unknowable, to be in fact the Unknowable, about which without being guilty of contradiction we can predicate nothing at all, except perhaps that It exists; and there are other types of <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnosticism</a>.

<p>Then again there is <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a> in an almost endless variety of forms, all of which, however, may be <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> reduced to the three following types: <ul><li>the purely materialistic, which, making matter the only reality, would explain life by mechanics and chemistry, reduce abstract thought to the level of an organic process deny any higher ultimate moral value to the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">Ten Commandments</a> than to Newton's law of gravitation, and, finally, identify <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself with the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> thus interpreted (see <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">M<font size=-2>ATERIALISM</font></a>; <a href="../cathen/10483a.htm">M<font size=-2>ONISM</font></a>); <li>the purely idealistic, which, choosing the contrary alternative, would make mind the only reality, convert the material <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> into an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, and identify <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with this all-embracing mind or <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, conceived as <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> evolving itself into passing phases or expressions of being and attaining self-consciousness in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of men; and <li>the combined <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">materialistic</a>-<a href="../cathen/07634a.htm">idealistic</a>, which tries to steer a middle course and without sacrificing mind to matter or matter to mind, would conceive the existing <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, with which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is identified, as some sort of "double-faced" single entity.</ul>

<p>Thus to accomplish even the beginning of his task the Theist has to show, against <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnostics</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> attainable by rational inference &#151; however inadequate and imperfect it may be &#151; is as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and valid, as far as it goes, as any other piece of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> we possess; and against <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheists</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of reason is a supra-mundane personal <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> distinct both from matter and from the finite <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> &#151; that neither we ourselves nor the earth we tread upon enter into the constitution of His being.

<h4 id="IAb">Types of theism</h4>

<p>But passing from views that are formally anti-theistic, it is found that among Theists themselves certain differences exist which tend to complicate the problem, and increase the difficulty of stating it briefly and clearly. Some of these differences are brief and clear.

<p>Some of these differences are merely formal and accidental and do not affect the substance of the theistic thesis, but others are of substantial importance, as, for instance, whether we can validly establish the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> existence by the same kind of rational inference (e.g. from effect to cause) as we employ in other departments of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, or whether, in order to justify our <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, we must not rather rely on some <a href="../cathen/15017a.htm">transcendental</a> principle or axiom, superior and antecedent to <a href="../cathen/04770a.htm">dialectical</a> reasoning; or on immediate <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a>; or on some moral, sentimental, emotional, or &aelig;sthetic <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> or perception, which is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a> denied in the name of "pure reason" the inferential validity of the classical theistic <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, while in the name of "practical reason" he postulated <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> existence as an implicate of the moral law, and <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant's</a> method has been followed or imitated by many Theists &#151; by some who fully agree with him in rejecting the classical arguments; by others, who, without going so far, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the apologetical expediency of trying to persuade rather than convince men to be Theists. A moderate reaction against the too rigidly mathematical intellectualism of <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a> was to be welcomed, but the <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kantian</a> reaction by its excesses has injured the cause of Theism and helped forward the cause of anti-theistic philosophy. Herbert Spencer, as is well known, borrowed most of his arguments for <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnosticism</a> from <a href="../cathen/07123a.htm">Hamilton</a> and Mansel, who had popularized <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kantian</a> criticism in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, while in trying to improve on <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant's</a> reconstructive transcendentalism, his German disciples (Fichte, Schelling, <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a>) drifted into <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>. <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a> also helped to prepare the way for the total disparagement of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> in relation to religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which constitutes the negative side of <a href="../cathen/15013a.htm">Traditionalism</a>, while the appeal of that system on the positive side to the common consent and tradition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> as the chief or sole criterion of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and more especially of religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> &#151; its authority as a criterion being traced ultimately to a positive <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a> &#151; is, like <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant's</a> refuge in practical reason, merely an illogical attempt to escape from <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnosticism</a>.



<p>Again, though <a href="../cathen/11257a.htm">Ontologism</a> &#151; like that of <a href="../cathen/09568a.htm">Malebranche</a> (d. 1715) &#151; is older than <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>, its revival in the nineteenth century (by <a href="../cathen/06562b.htm">Gioberti</a>, <a href="../cathen/13194b.htm">Rosmini</a>, and others) has been inspired to some extent by <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kantian</a> influences. This system maintains that we have naturally some immediate consciousness, however dim at first, or some <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuitive</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> &#151; not indeed that we see Him <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">in His essence face to face</a> but that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him in His relation to creatures by the same act of cognition &#151; according to <a href="../cathen/13194b.htm">Rosmini</a>, as we become conscious of being in general &#151; and therefore that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His existence is as much a datum of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> as is the abstract <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of being.

<p>Finally, the philosophy of <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernism</a> &#151; about which there has recently been such a stir &#151; is a somewhat complex medley of these various systems and tendencies; its main features as a system are: <ul><li>negatively, a thoroughgoing <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnosticism</a>, and <li>positively, the assertion of an immediate sense or experience of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as immanent in the life of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> &#151; an experience which is at first only subconscious, but which, when the requisite <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> dispositions are present, becomes an object of conscious <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>.</ul>

<p>Now all these varying types of Theism, in so far as they are opposed to the classical and traditional type, may be reduced to one or other of the two following propositions: <ul><li>that we have naturally an immediate consciousness or <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> existence and may therefore dispense with any attempt to prove this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> inferentially; <li>that, though we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuitively</a> and cannot prove it inferentially in such a way as to satisfy the speculative reason, we can, nevertheless, and must conscientiously believe it on other than strictly <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> grounds. </ul>But an appeal to experience, not to mention other objections, is sufficient to negative the first proposition &#151; and the second, which, as history has already made clear, is an illogical compromise with <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnosticism</a>, is best refuted by a simple statement of the theistic Proofs. It is not the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> that are found to be fallacious but the criticism which rejects them. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of course &#151; and no Theist denies it &#151; that for the proper <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> appreciation of theistic <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> dispositions are required, and that moral consciousness, the &aelig;sthetic faculty, and whatever other powers or capacities belong to man's spiritual nature, constitute or supply so many data on which to base inferential <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>. But this is very different from holding that we possess any faculty or power which assures us of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> existence and which is independent of, and superior to, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> that regulate our assent to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in general &#151; that in the religious sphere we can transcend those <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> without confessing our <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be irrational. It is also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that a mere barren <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> assent to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> existence &#151; and such an assent is conceivable &#151; falls very far short of what religious assent ought to be; that what is taught in <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a> about the worthlessness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> uninformed by charity has its counterpart in natural religion; and that practical Theism, if it pretends to be adequate, must appeal not merely to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> but to the heart and <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> and be capable of winning the total allegiance of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">rational</a> creatures. But here again we meet with exaggeration and confusion on the part of those Theists who would substitute for <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> assent something that does not exclude but presupposes it and is only required to complement it. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and pertinency of these observations will be made clear by the following summary of the classical arguments for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> existence.

<h3 id="IB">Theistic proofs</h3>

<p>The arguments for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> existence are variously classified and entitled by different writers, but all agree in recognizing the distinction between <em>a priori</em>, or <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deductive</a>, and <em>a posteriori</em>, or <a href="../cathen/07779a.htm">inductive reasoning</a> in this connection. And while all admit the validity and sufficiency of the latter method, opinion is divided in regard to the former. Some maintain that a valid <em>a priori</em> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> (usually called the ontological) is available; others deny this completely; while some others maintain an attitude of compromise or neutrality. This difference, it should be observed, applies only to the question of proving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> actual existence; for, His self-existence being admitted, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to employ <em>a priori</em> or <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deductive</a> inference in order to arrive at a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of His nature and attributes, and as it is impossible to develop the arguments for His existence without some working notion of His nature, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to some extent to anticipate the <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deductive</a> stage and combine the <em>a priori</em> with the <em>a posteriori</em> method. But no strictly <em>a priori</em> conclusion need be more than hypothetically assumed at this stage.

<h4 id="IBa"><em>A posteriori</em> argument</h4>

<p><a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<em>Summa Theologica</em> I:2:3; Cont. Gent., I, xiii) and after him many scholastic writers advance the five following arguments to prove the existence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: <ul><li>Motion, i.e. the passing from power to act, as it takes place in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> implies a first unmoved Mover (<em>primum movens immobile</em>), who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; else we should postulate an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> series of movers, which is inconceivable. <li>For the same reason efficient causes, as we see them operating in this world, imply the existence of a First Cause that is uncaused, i.e. that possesses in itself the sufficient reason for its existence; and this is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <li>The fact that contingent beings exist, i.e. beings whose non-existence is recognized as possible, implies the existence of a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> being, who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <li>The graduated perfections of being actually existing in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> can be understood only by comparison with an absolute standard that is also actual, i.e., an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> perfect Being such as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <li>The wonderful order or evidence of intelligent design which the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> exhibits implies the existence of a supramundane Designer, who is no other than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself. </ul>To these many Theists add other arguments: <ul><li>the common consent of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> (usually described by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers as the <em>moral</em> argument), <li>from the internal witness of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> to the supremacy of the moral law, and, therefore, to the existence of a supreme Lawgiver (this may be called the <em>ethical</em> argument, or <li>from the existence and perception of beauty in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> (the <em>aesthetical</em> argument). </ul>

<p>One might go on, indeed, almost indefinitely multiplying and distinguishing arguments; but to do so would only lead to confusion.

<p>The various arguments mentioned &#151; and the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of others that might be added &#151; are not in reality distinct and independent arguments, but only so many partial statements of one and the same general argument, which is perhaps best described as the <a href="../cathen/04413a.htm">cosmological</a>. This argument assumes the validity of the principle of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> or sufficient reason and, stated in its most comprehensive form, amounts to this: that it is impossible according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of human thought to give any ultimate rational explanation of the phenomena of external experience and of internal consciousness &#151; in other words to synthesize the data which the actual <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> as a whole supplies (and this is the recognized aim of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>) &#151; unless by admitting the existence of a self-sufficient and self-explanatory cause or ground of being and activity, to which all these phenomena may be ultimately referred.

<p>It is, therefore, mainly a question of method and expediency what particular points one may select from the multitude available to illustrate and enforce the general <em>a posteriori</em> argument. For our purpose it will suffice to state as briefly as possible <ul><li>the general argument proving the self-existence of a First Cause, <li>the special arguments proving the existence of an intelligent Designer and <li>of a Supreme Moral Ruler, and <li>the confirmatory argument from the general Consent of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>.</ul>

<p id="IBb"><em>(a) The general causality argument</em>

<p>We must start by assuming the objective <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> and validity of the principle of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> or sufficient reason &#151; an assumption upon which the value of the physical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> and of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> generally is based. To question its objective <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, as did <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>, and represent it as a mere <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> a priori, or possessing only subjective validity, would open the door to subjectivism and universal scepticism. It is impossible to prove the principle of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>, just as it is impossible to prove the principle of contradiction; but it is not difficult to see that if the former is denied the latter may also be denied and the whole process of human reasoning declared fallacious. The principle states that whatever exists or happens must have a sufficient reason for its existence or occurrence either in itself or in something else; in other words that whatever does not exist of absolute necessity - whatever is not self-existent &#151; cannot exist without a proportionate cause external to itself; and if this principle is valid when employed by the scientist to explain the phenomena of physics it must be equally valid when employed by the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> for the ultimate explanation of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> as a whole. In the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> we observe that certain things are effects, i.e. they depend for their existence on other things, and these again on others; but, however far back we may extend this series of effects and dependent causes, we must, if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is to be satisfied, come ultimately to a cause that is not itself an effect, in other words to an uncaused cause or self-existent being which is the ground and cause of all being. And this conclusion, as thus stated, is virtually admitted by <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">agnostics</a> and <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheists</a>, all of whom are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to speak of an eternal something underlying the phenomenal <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, whether this something be the "Unknown", or the "Absolute", or the "Unconscious", or "Matter" itself, or the "Ego", or the "Idea" of being, or the "Will"; these are so many substitutes for the uncaused cause or self-existent being of Theism. What <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">anti-Theists</a> refuse to admit is not the existence of a First Cause in an indeterminate sense, but the existence of an intelligent and free First Cause, a personal <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, distinct from the material <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. But the very same reason that compels us to postulate a First Cause at all requires that this cause should be a free and intelligent being. The spiritual world of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> must be recognized by the sane <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> to be as real as the world of matter; man knows that he has a spiritual nature and performs spiritual acts as clearly and as certainly as he knows that he has eyes to see with and ears to hear with; and the phenomena of man's spiritual nature can only be explained in one way &#151; by attributing spirituality, i.e. intelligence and <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, to the First Cause, in other words by recognizing a personal <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the cause in all cases must be proportionate to the effect, i.e. must contain somehow in itself every perfection of being that is realized in the effect.

<p>The cogency of this argument becomes more apparent if account be taken of the fact that the human species had its origin at a comparatively late period in the history of the actual <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. There was a time when neither man nor any other living thing inhabited this globe of ours; and without pressing the point regarding the origin of life itself from inanimate matter or the evolution of man's body from lower organic types, it may be maintained with absolute confidence that no explanation of the origin of man's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can be made out on evolutionary lines, and that recourse must be had to the creative power of a spiritual or personal First Cause. It might also be urged, as an inference from the physical theories commonly accepted by present-day scientists, that the actual organization of the material <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> had a definite beginning in time. If it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the goal towards which physical evolution is tending is the uniform distribution of heat and other forms of energy, it would follow clearly that the existing process has not been going on from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; else the goal would have been reached long ago. And if the process had a beginning, how did it originate? If the primal mass was inert and uniform, it is impossible to conceive how motion and differentiation were introduced except from without, while if these are held to be coeval with matter, the cosmic process, which is <em>ex hypothesi</em> is temporal, would be eternal, unless it be granted that matter itself had a definite beginning in time.

<p>But the argument, strictly speaking, is conclusive even if it be granted that the world may have existed from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, in the sense, that is, that, no matter how far back one may go, no point of time can be reached at which created being was not already in existence. In this sense <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> held matter to be eternal and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, while denying the fact, admitted the possibility of its being so. But such relative <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is nothing more in reality than <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> or indefinite temporal duration and is altogether different from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> we attribute to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence to admit that the world might possibly be eternal in this sense implies no denial of the essentially finite and contingent character of its existence. On the contrary it helps to emphasize this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, for the same relation of dependence upon a self-existing cause which is implied in the contingency of any single being is implied <em>a fortiori</em> in the existence of an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> series of such beings, supposing such a series to be possible.

<p>Nor can it be maintained with <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheists</a> that the world, whether of matter or of mind or of both, contains within itself the sufficient reason of its own existence. A self-existing world would exist of absolute necessity and would be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in every kind of perfection; but of nothing are we more certain than that the world as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, in its totality as well as in its parts, realizes only finite degrees of perfection. It is a mere contradiction in terms, however much one may try to cover up and conceal the contradiction by an ambiguous and confusing use of language, to predicate <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of matter or of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and one or the other or both must be held by the <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheist</a> to be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. In other words the distinction between the finite and the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> must be abolished and the principle of contradiction denied. This criticism applies to every variety of <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a> strictly so called, while crude, materialistic <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a> involves so many additional and more obvious absurdities that hardly any <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> deserving of the name will be found to maintain it in our day. On the other hand, as regards idealistic <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, which enjoys a considerable vogue in our day, it is to be observed in the first place that in many cases this is a tendency rather than a formal <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, that it is in fact nothing more than a confused and perverted form of Theism, based especially upon an exaggerated and one-sided view of Divine immanence (see below, iii). And this confusion works to the advantage of <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a> by enabling it to make a specious appeal to the very arguments which justify Theism. Indeed the whole strength of the <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> position as against <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">Atheism</a> lies in what it holds in common with Theism; while, on the other hand, its weakness as a world theory becomes evident as soon as it diverges from or contradicts Theism. Whereas Theism, for example, safeguards such primary <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> as the reality of human <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, freedom, and moral responsibility, <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a> is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to sacrifice all these, to deny the existence of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, whether physical or moral, to destroy the rational basis of religion, and, under pretence of making man his own God, to rob him of nearly all his plain, common sense convictions and of all his highest incentives to good conduct. The philosophy which leads to such results cannot but be radically unsound.

<p id="IBc"><em>(b) The argument from design</em>

<p>The special argument based on the existence of order or design in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> (also called the <em>teleological argument</em>) proves immediately the existence of a supramundane mind of vast intelligence, and ultimately the existence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This argument is capable of being developed at great length, but it must be stated here very briefly. It has always been a favourite argument both with <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and with popular apologists of Theism; and though, during the earlier excesses of enthusiasm for or against Darwinianism, it was often asserted or admitted that the evolutionary hypothesis had overthrown the teleological argument, it is now recognized that the very opposite is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and that the evidences of design which the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> exhibits are not less but more impressive when viewed from the evolutionary standpoint. To begin with particular examples of adaptation which may be appealed to in countless number &#151; the eye, for instance, as an organ of sight is a conspicuous embodiment of intelligent purpose &#151; and not less but more so when viewed as the product of an evolutionary process rather than the immediate handiwork of the Creator. There is no option in such cases between the hypothesis of a directing intelligence and that of blind chance, and the absurdity of supposing that the eye originated suddenly by a single blind chance is augmented a thousand-fold by suggesting that it may be the product of a progressive series of such chances. "Natural selection", "survival of the fittest", and similar terms merely describe certain phases in the supposed process of evolution without helping the least to explain it; and as opposed to teleology they mean nothing more than blind chance. The eye is only one of the countless examples of adaptation to particular ends discernible in every part of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, inorganic as well as organic; for the atom as well as the cell contributes to the evidence available. Nor is the argument weakened by our inability in many cases to explain the particular purpose of certain structures or organisms. Our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of nature is too limited to be made the measure of nature's entire design, while as against our <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of some particular purposes we are entitled to maintain the presumption that if intelligence is anywhere apparent it is dominant everywhere. Moreover, in our search for particular instances of design we must not overlook the evidence supplied by the harmonious unity of nature as a whole. The <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it is a cosmos, a vastly complex system of correlated and interdependent parts, each subject to particular <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and all together subject to a <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> or a combination of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> as the result of which the pursuit of particular ends is made to contribute in a marvellous way to the attainment of a common purpose; and it is simply inconceivable that this cosmic unity should be the product of chance or accident. If it be objected that there is another side to the picture, that the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> abounds in imperfections &#151; maladjustments, failures, seemingly purposeless waste &#151; the reply is not far to seek. For it is not maintained that the existing world is the best possible, and it is only on the supposition of its being so that the imperfections referred to would be excluded. Admitting without exaggerating their reality &#151; admitting, that is, the existence of physical <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> &#151; there still remains a large balance on the side of order and harmony, and to account for this there is required not only an intelligent mind but one that is good and benevolent, though so far as this special argument goes this mind might conceivably be finite. To prove the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of the world's Designer it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to fall back on the general argument already explained and on the <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deductive</a> argument to be explained below by which <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> is inferred from self-existence. Finally, by way of direct reply to the problem suggested by the objection, it is to be observed that, to appreciate fully the evidence for design, we must, in addition to particular instances of adaptation and to the cosmic unity observable in the world of today, consider the historical continuity of nature throughout indefinite ages in the past and indefinite ages to come. We do not and cannot comprehend the full scope of nature's design, for it is not a static <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> we have to study but a <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> that is progressively unfolding itself and moving towards the fulfilment of an ultimate purpose under the guidance of a master mind. And towards that purpose the imperfect as well as the perfect &#151; apparent <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and discord as well as obvious good order &#151; may contribute in ways which we can but dimly discern. The well-balanced <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, who realizes his own limitations in the presence of nature's Designer, so far from claiming that every detail of that Designer's purpose should at present be plain to his inferior intelligence, will be content to await the final solution of enigmas which the hereafter promises to furnish.

<p id="IBd"><em>(c) The argument from conscience</em>

<p>To <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> and others the argument from <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, or the sense of moral responsibility, has seemed the most intimately persuasive of all the arguments for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> existence, while to it alone <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a> allowed an absolute value. But this is not an independent argument, although, properly understood, it serves to emphasize a point in the general a posteriori <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> which is calculated to appeal with particular force to many <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a>. It is not that <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, as such, contains a direct revelation or <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the author of the moral law, but that, taking man's sense of moral responsibility as a phenomenon to be explained, no ultimate explanation can be given except by supposing the existence of a Superior and Lawgiver whom man is bound to obey. And just as the argument from design brings out prominently the attribute of intelligence, so the argument from <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> brings out the attribute of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> in the First Cause and self-existent Personal Being with whom we must ultimately identify the Designer and the Lawgiver.

<p id="IBe"><em>(d) The argument from universal consent</em>

<p>The confirmatory argument based on the consent of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> may be stated briefly as follows: <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> as a whole has at all times and everywhere believed and continues to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the existence of some superior being or beings on whom the material world and man himself are dependent, and this fact cannot be accounted for except by admitting that this <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or at least contains a germ of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. It is admitted of course that <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">Polytheism</a>, <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a>, <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, and other forms of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> have mingled with and disfigured this universal <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, but this does not destroy the force of the argument we are considering. For at least the germinal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which consists in the recognition of some kind of deity is common to every form of religion and can therefore claim in its support the universal consent of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. And how can this consent be explained except as a result of the perception by the minds of men of the evidence for the existence of deity? It is too large a subject to be entered upon here &#151; the discussion of the various theories that have been advanced to account in some other way for the origin and universality of religion; but it may safely be said that, abstracting from revelation, which need not be discussed at this stage, no other theory will stand the test of criticism. And, assuming that this is the best explanation philosophy has to offer, it may further be maintained that this consent of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> tells ultimately in favour of Theism. For it is clear from history that religion is liable to degenerate, and has in many instances degenerated instead of progressing; and even if it be impossible to prove conclusively that <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">Monotheism</a> was the primitive historical religion, there is nevertheless a good deal of positive evidence adducible in support of this contention. And if this be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reading of history, it is permissible to interpret the universality of religion as witnessing implicitly to the original <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which, however much obscured it may have become, in many cases could never be entirely obliterated. But even if the history of religion is to read as a record of progressive development one ought in all fairness, in accordance with a well-recognized principle, to seek its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> meaning and significance not at the lowest but at the highest point of development; and it cannot be denied that Theism in the strict sense is the ultimate form which religion naturally tends to assume.

<p>If there have been and are today <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheistic</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who oppose the common <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, these are comparatively few and their dissent only serves to emphasize more strongly the consent of normal humanity. Their existence is an abnormality to be accounted for as such things usually are. Could it be claimed on their behalf, individually or collectively, that in ability, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, character, or life they excel the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> larger number of cultured men who adhere on conviction to what the race at large has believed, then indeed it might be admitted that their opposition would be somewhat formidable. But no such claim can be made; on the contrary, if a comparison were called for it would be easy to make out an overwhelming case for the other side. Or again, if it were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the progress of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> had brought to light any new and serious difficulties against religion, there would, especially in view of the modern vogue of <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnosticism</a>, be some reason for alarm as to the soundness of the traditional <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. But so far is this from being the case that in the words of Professor Huxley &#151; an unsuspected witness &#151; "not a solitary problem presents itself to the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> Theist at the present day which has not existed from the time that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> began to think out the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> grounds and the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> consequences of Theism" (Life and Letters of Ch. Darwin by F. Darwin, II, p. 203). Substantially the same arguments as are used today were employed by old-time sceptical <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">Atheists</a> in the effort to overthrow man's <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the existence of the Divine, and the fact that this <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> has withstood repeated assaults during so many ages in the past is the best guarantee of its permanency in the future. It is too firmly implanted in the depths of man's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for little surface storms to uproot it.

<h4 id="IBf"><em>A priori</em>, or ontological, argument</h4>

<p>This argument undertakes to deduce the existence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of Him as the Infinite which is present to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>; but as already stated, theistic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are not agreed as to the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> validity of this deduction.

<p>As stated by <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, the argument runs thus: The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the Infinite means the greatest Being that can be thought of, but unless actual existence outside the mind is included in this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would not be the greatest conceivable Being since a Being that exists both in the mind as an object of thought, and outside the mind or objectively, would be greater than a Being that exists in the mind only; therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> exists not only in the mind but outside of it.

<p><a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a> states the argument in a slightly different way as follows: Whatever is contained in a clear and distinct <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a thing must be predicated of that thing; but a clear and distinct <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of an absolutely perfect Being contains the notion of actual existence; therefore since we have the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of an absolutely perfect Being such a Being must really exist.

<p>To mention a third form of statement, <a href="../cathen/09134b.htm">Leibniz</a> would put the argument thus: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is at least possible since the concept of Him as the Infinite implies no contradiction; but if He is possible He must exist because the concept of Him involves existence. In St. Anselm's own day this argument was objected to by Gaunilo, who maintained as a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> that were it valid one could prove by means of it the actual existence somewhere of an ideal island far surpassing in riches and delights the fabled Isles of the Blessed. But this criticism however smart it may seem is clearly unsound, for it overlooks the fact that the argument is not intended to apply to finite ideals but only to the strictly <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>; and if it is admitted that we possess a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, and that this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is not self-contradictory, it does not seem possible to find any flaw in the argument. Actual existence is certainly included in any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> concept of the Infinite, and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who admits that he has a concept of an Infinite Being cannot deny that he conceives it as actually existing. But the difficulty is with regard to this preliminary admission, which if challenged &#151; as it is in fact challenged by <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnostics</a> &#151; requires to be justified by recurring to the <em>a posteriori</em> argument, i.e. to the inference by way of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> from contingency to self-existence and thence by way of deduction to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>. Hence the great majority of scholastic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> have rejected the ontological argument as propounded by <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> and <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a> nor as put forward by Leibniz does it escape the difficulty that has been stated.

<h2 id="ii">As known through faith &#151; ("the God of revelation")</h2>

<h3 id="IIa">Sacred Scriptures</h3>

<p>Neither in the Old or <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> do we find any elaborate argumentation devoted to proving that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> exists. This <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is rather taken for granted, as being something, for example, that only the fool will deny in his heart [<a href="../bible/psa013.htm#vrs1">Psalm 13:1</a> and <a href="../bible/psa052.htm#vrs1">52:1</a>]; and argumentation, when resorted to, is directed chiefly against <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a> and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. But in several passages we have a cursory appeal to some phase of the general <a href="../cathen/04413a.htm">cosmological</a> argument: v.g. <a href="../bible/psa018.htm#vrs1">Psalm 18:1</a> and <a href="../bible/psa093.htm">93:5 sqq.</a>, <a href="../bible/isa041.htm#vrs26">Isaiah 41:26 sqq.</a>; II Mach., vii, 28, etc.; and in some few others &#151; Wis. xiii, 1-9; Rom., i, 18,20 &#151; the argument is presented in a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> way, and men who reason rightly are held to be inexcusable for failing to recognize and worship the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">one true God</a>, the Author and Ruler of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>.

<p>These two latter texts merit more than passing attention. Wis., xiii, 1-9 reads:<blockquote><p>But all men are vain in whom there is not the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and who by these good things that are seen, could not understand him that is, neither by attending to the works have acknowledged who was the workman: but have imagined either the fire, or the wind, or the swift air or the circle of the stars, or the great water, or the sun and moon, to be the gods that rule the world. With whose beauty, if they, being delighted, took them to be gods: let them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how much the Lord of them is more beautiful than they: for the first author of beauty made all those things. Or if they admired their power and effects, let them understand by them that he that made them, is mightier than they: for by the greatness of the beauty, and of the creature, the creator of them may be seen, so as to be known thereby. But yet as to these they are less to be blamed. For they perhaps <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, seeking <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and desirous to find him. For being conversant among his works, they search: and they are persuaded that the things are good which are seen. But then again they are not to be pardoned. For if they were able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> so much as to make a judgment of the world: how did they not more easily find out the Lord thereof?</p></blockquote>

<p>Here it is clearly taught <ul><li>that the phenomenal or contingent world &#151; the things that are seen &#151; requires a cause distinct from and greater than itself or any of its elements; <li>that this cause who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not unknowable, but is known with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> not only to exist but to possess in Himself, in a higher degree, whatever beauty, strength, or other perfections are realized in His works, <li>that this conclusion is attainable by the right exercise of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, without reference to <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> revelation, and that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, therefore, who are able to interpret the world philosophically, are inexcusable for their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">true God</a>, their failure, it is implied, being due rather to lack of good will than to the incapacity of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.</ul>

<p>Substantially the same <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is laid down more briefly by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> in <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#vrs18">Romans 1:18-20</a>:<blockquote><p>For the wrath of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is revealed from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> against all ungodliness and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> of those men that detain the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>: because that which is known of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is manifest in them. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath manifested it unto them. For the invisible things of him, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, his eternal power also and divinity: so that they are inexcusable.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is to be observed that the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> of whom <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> is speaking are not blamed for their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> revelation and the Mosaic law, but for failing to preserve or for corrupting that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of man's <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> towards Him which nature itself ought to have taught them. Indeed it is not pure <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> as such they are blamed for, but that wilful shirking of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which renders <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> culpable. Even under the corruptions of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> recognized the indestructible permanency of germinal religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/rom002.htm#vrs14">Romans 2:14-15</a>).

<p>It is clear from these passages that <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnosticism</a> and <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a> are condemned by revelation, while the validity of the general <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> existence given above is confirmed. It is also clear that the extreme form of <a href="../cathen/15013a.htm">Traditionalism</a>, which would hold that no certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> existence or nature is attainable by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> without the aid of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> revelation, is condemned.

<h3 id="IIb">Church councils</h3>

<p>What the author of Wisdom and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and after them the Fathers and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> had constantly taught, has been solemnly defined by the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. In the first place, as against <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnosticism</a> and <a href="../cathen/15013a.htm">Traditionalism</a>, the council teaches (cap. ii, De revelat.)<blockquote><p>that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the first cause (<em>principium</em>) and last end of all things, can, from created things, be known with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> by the natural light of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> (Denz., 1785-old no. 1634)</p></blockquote>

<p>and in the corresponding canon (can. i, De revelat.) it <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizes</a> anyone who would say<blockquote><p>that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">one true God</a> our Creator and Lord, cannot, through the things that are made, be known with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> by the natural light of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> (Denz., 1806-old no. 1653).</p></blockquote>

<p>As against <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnosticism</a> this definition needs no explanation. As against <a href="../cathen/15013a.htm">Traditionalism</a>, it is to be observed that the definition is directed only against the extreme form of that theory, as held by <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Lamennais</a> and others according to which &#151; taking <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as it is &#151; there would not, and could not, have been any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, among men, had there not been at least a primitive <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> revelation &#151; in other words, natural religion as such is an impossibility. There is no reference to milder forms of <a href="../cathen/15013a.htm">Traditionalism</a> which hold social tradition and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the development of man's rational powers, and consequently deny, for example, that an individual cut off from human <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> from his infancy, and left entirely to himself, could ever attain a certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or any strictly rational <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> at all. That is a <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> problem on which the council has nothing to say. Neither does it deny that even in case of the <em>homo socialis</em> a certain degree of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and culture may be required in order that he may, by independent reasoning, arrive at a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but it merely affirms the broad principle that by the proper use of their natural reasoning power, applied to the phenomena of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, men are able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>.

<p>In the next place, as against <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, the council (cap. i, De Deo) teaches that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, "since He is one singular, altogether simple and incommutable spiritual substance, must be proclaimed to be really and essentially [re et essentia) distinct from the world most <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in and by Himself, and ineffably above and beyond all things, actual or possible, besides Himself" (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, 1782-old no. 1631); and in the corresponding canons (ii-iv, De Deo) <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> is pronounced against anyone who would say "that nothing exists but matter"; or "that the substance or essence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of all things is one and the same"; or "that finite things both corporeal and spiritual, or at least spiritual, have emanated from the Divine substance; or that the Divine essence by a manifestation or evolution of itself becomes all things; or that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is universal or indefinite being, which by determining itself constitutes the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> of things distinguished into genera, species and <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>" (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, 1802-4; old no. 1648).

<p>These definitions are framed so as to cover and exclude every type of the <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> theory, and nobody will deny that they are in harmony with Scriptural teaching. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a>, for example, than which none is more clearly taught or more frequently emphasized in <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a>, is radically opposed to <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a> &#151; creation as the sacred writers understand it being the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act of a free agent bringing creatures into being out of nothingness.

<h3 id="IIc">The knowability of God</h3>

<p>It will be observed that neither the Scriptural texts we have quoted nor the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> decrees say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> existence can be <em>proved</em> or <em>demonstrated</em>; they merely affirm that it can be <em>known with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a></em>. Now one may, if one wishes, insist on the distinction between what is <em>knowable</em> and what is <em>demonstrable</em>, but in the present connection this distinction has little real import. It has never been claimed that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> existence can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> mathematically, as a proposition in geometry is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, and most Theists reject every form of the ontological or <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deductive</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. But if the term <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> or demonstration may be, as it often is, applied to <em>a posteriori</em> or <a href="../cathen/07779a.htm">inductive</a> inference, by means of which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that is not innate or <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuitive</a> is acquired by the exercise of reason, then it cannot fairly be denied that <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> virtually asserts that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> existence can be <em>proved</em>. Certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is declared to be attainable "by the light of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>", i.e. of the reasoning faculty as such <em>from</em> or <em>through</em> "the things that are made"; and this clearly implies an inferential process such as in other connections men do not hesitate to call <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>.

<p>Hence it is fair to conclude that the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, following <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a>, has virtually condemned the Scepticism which rejects the <em>a posteriori</em> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. But it did not deal directly with <a href="../cathen/11257a.htm">Ontologism</a>, although certain propositions of the <a href="../cathen/11257a.htm">Ontologists</a> had already been condemned as unsafe (<em>tuto tradi non posse</em>) by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Holy Office (18 September, 1861), and among the propositions of <a href="../cathen/13194b.htm">Rosmini</a> subsequently condemned (14 December, 1887) several reassert the ontologist principle. This condemnation by the Holy Office is quite sufficient to discredit <a href="../cathen/11257a.htm">Ontologism</a>, regarding which it is enough to say here <ul><li>that, as already observed, experience contradicts the assumption that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> has naturally or necessarily an immediate consciousness or <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> of the Divine, <li>that such a theory obscures, and tends to do away with, the difference, on which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> insists (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#vrs12">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>), between our earthly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ("through a glass in a dark manner") and the vision of Him which the blessed in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> enjoy ("face to face") and seems irreconcilable with the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>, defined by the Council of Vienne, that, to be capable of the face to face or <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">intuitive vision of God</a>, the human <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> needs to be endowed with a special <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> light, the <em>lumen gloriae</em> and <li>finally that, in so far as it is clearly intelligible, the theory goes dangerously near to <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>.</ul>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> "Lamentabili" (3 July, 1907) and the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi" (7 September, 1907), issued by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pope Pius X</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> position is once more reaffirmed and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnosticism</a> condemned. In its bearing on our subject, this act of Church authority is merely a restatement of the teaching of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, and a reassertion of the principle which has been always maintained, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must be naturally knowable if <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him and His revelation is to be reasonable; and if a concrete example be needed to show how, of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> necessity, the substance of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> vanishes into thin air once the <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">agnostic</a> principle is adopted, one has only to point the finger at <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernism</a>. Rational theism is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> basis for <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a>; and that the natural <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and natural religion, which <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> holds to be possible, are not necessarily the result of grace, i.e. of a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> aid given directly by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, follows from the condemnation by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> of one of the propositions of <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a> (prop. 41) in which the contrary is asserted (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, 1391; old no. 1256).
