<h1>The Faithful</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>fideles</em>, from <em>fides</em>, faith.)

<p>Those who have bound themselves to a religious association, whose <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> they accept, and into whose rites they have been initiated. Among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> the term is applied to those who have been fully initiated by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and, regularly speaking, by confirmation. Such have engaged themselves to profess <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, from Whom they received it as a gift; henceforth they will proclaim His teachings, and live according to His law. Hence the term so frequent in <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> documents, <em>Christifideles</em>, "the faithful of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>". The distinction between <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and faithful is now very slight, not only because adult <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> has become the exception, but also because liturgically the rite of the catechumenate and that of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> have merged into one another. On the other hand, in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> at least, confirmation and first Communion have been separated from the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> initiation. In the primitive Church it was otherwise; initiation into the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> consisted in two distinct acts, often accomplished years apart from one another. First, one became a <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>; this was a kind of preliminary profession of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> &#151; "eos qui ad primam fidem credulitatis accedunt" (Council of Elvira, about 300, can.xlii), which authorized the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a> to call himself a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. Only by the second act of initiation, i.e. by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> itself, was he authorized to call himself one of the faithful, and participate immediately in all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Christian mysteries</a>, including the Eucharist.

<p>Strictly speaking, therefore, the term <em>faithful</em> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a>; hence, it is not met in the writings of these early <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Christian Fathers</a> who flourished before the organization of the catechumenate. It is not found in <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> nor in St. Iren&aelig;us of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>; <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, however, uses it, and reproaches the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> for obliterating all distinction between <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> and the faithful: <em>quis catechumenus, quis fidelis incertum est</em> (De praeser., c. xli; P.L., II, 56). Henceforth, in the patristic writings and canons of councils we meet quite frequently the antithesis of <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and faithful. Thus St. Augustine (Tract. in Joannem, xliv, 2; P.L., XXXV, 1714): "Ask a man: are you a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>? If he be a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> or a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, he will reply: I am not a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. But if he say: I am a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, ask him again: are you a <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a>, or one of the faithful?" Similarly the Council of Elvira considers the case of a "faithful" <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> a <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a> in case of necessity (can. xxxviii); again, of sick <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> asking for the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> of the catechumenate, and thus becoming <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (can. xxxix); of participation in an <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> sacrifice on the part of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and again by one of the faithful (can. lix); of betrayal to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> magistrate (<em>delatio</em>), to which a difference of guilt is attached according as the crime was perpetrated by one of the faithful or by a <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a> (can. lxxiii).

<p>The title <em>fidelis</em> was often carved on epitaphs in the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> period, sometimes in opposition to the title of <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a>. Thus, at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, a master (<em>patronus</em>) dedicates to his <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a> servant (<em>alumna</em>) the following inscription: "Sozomeneti Alumnae audienti patronus fidelis", i.e. "her master, one of the faithful, to Sozomenes, his servant and hearer", by which term he means one of the well-known degrees of the catechumenate (<a href="../cathen/09723b.htm">Martigny</a>, Dict. des antiq. chre&eacute;t., Paris, 1877). Even now the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> rite provides for <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> request of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> on the part of an <em>infidelis</em>, i.e. a non-Christian (see INFIDEL); it exhibits venerable vestiges of the primitive <em>scrutinium</em> or preliminary examination, the guarantors (<em>sponsores</em>) or god-father and god-mother, the rites of the catechumenate, the communication of the Creed (<em>traditio symboli</em>) and the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Our Father</a>, the renunciation of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the adhesion to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and the triple profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The candidate for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is still asked at the entrance to the <a href="../cathen/02274a.htm">baptismal font</a>: "Wilt thou be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>? It was <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, therefore, and is so yet, that one entered the ranks of the faithful through the principal initiatory rite of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.

<p>Naturally enough, even in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity, attention was drawn to the analogous ceremonies of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> (the sign, if not the rite, of the admission of <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselytes</a> to the profession of <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>) and of the bloody bath of the <em>taurobolium</em>, by which the faithful of <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithra</a> were initiated (Cumont, Les Myste&eacute;res de Mithra, Paris, 1902). The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of the faithful <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> are indicated by the preparatory rites of his reception and by his actual <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. He begins by asking for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>) and, through that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for eternal life. The Creed is then delivered to him, and he returns it (<em>redditio symboli</em>) i.e. repeats it aloud. At the <a href="../cathen/02274a.htm">baptismal font</a> he recites solemnly the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. From all this it is clear that his first <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> is to believe (see <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">FAITH</a>). His second <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> is to regulate his life or conduct with his new <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a>, i.e. having renounced <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, he must avoid all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. "So behave", was it said to him, "that henceforth thou mayest be the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory I</a> says (Hom. in Evang. xxix, 3; P.L., LXXVI, 1215): "Then only are we truly the faithful when by our acts we realize the promises made with our lips. On the day of our <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, indeed, we promised to renounce all the works and all the pomps of the ancient enemy."

<p>Finally, since the faithful have <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> sought membership in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian society</a> they are bound to submit to its authority and obey its rulers. As to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the faithful, they consist chiefly in the fullest participation in all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Christian mysteries</a>, so long as one does not become unworthy of the same. Thus the faithful <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is entitled to take part in the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>, to remain in the assembly after the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> has sent away the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, to offer up with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> the <em>orate fidelium</em> or <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the faithful, to receive there the Body and Blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and to receive the other rites and <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. He may also aspire to the highest rank of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In a word, he is a full member of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, and is such, regularly speaking, in perpetuity. If by reason of his own misdeeds he deserves to be expelled from said <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, repentance and the reparatory penitential rite, a second <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, as it were, permit his return. Finally, if he persist in the observance of his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> promises, he will obtain eternal life, i.e. his original petition at the moment of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. See <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">BAPTISM</a>, <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">CATECHUMEN</a>.
