<h1>The Fathers of Mercy</h1>  

<p>A congregation of missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> first established at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in 1808, and later at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in 1814, and finally approved by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a>, 18 February, 1834. The founder, Very Rev. Jean-Baptiste Rauzan, was born at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, 5 December, 1757, and died in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 5 September, 1847. After completing his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies, he taught <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and sacred eloquence, and later was chosen <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>. Here he inaugurated a missionary movement to save the Faith to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. On the recommendation of Cardinal d'Aviau, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Cardinal Fesch</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, who was especially interested in the project, invited Father Rauzan to <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, where, in 1808, he gathered around him a number of Zealous and noted preachers. So effective was their preaching in the <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Diocese of Troyes</a>, that they won the favour of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a>, and received from the Government, unsolicited, subsidies to defray the expenses of their missions. This favour, however, was short-lived, for, owing to <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> quarrel with <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, which was called the Missionaries of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, was suppressed. In 1814, at the suggestion of <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Cardinal Fesch</a>, Father Rauzan rallied his co-labourers, adding others, among whom were the young <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of <a href="../cathen/03566c.htm">Chamb&eacute;ry</a>, de Forbin-Janson, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a>, the Abb&eacute;ss Frayssinous, who founded St. Stanislaus's College and instructed the young missionaries in sacred eloquence, Legris Duval, the <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> of his day, Le Vasseur, Bach, <a href="../cathen/03142a.htm">Caillau</a>, Carboy, and others.

<p>Starting with renewed <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, the Missionaries of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> not only evangelized the cities of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Rennes</a>, <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, Toulon, Paris, and many other places, but established the works of St. Genevieve and the Association of the Ladies of Providence, who still exist in many parts of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, rendering valuable service to the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>. Father Rauzan founded the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Clotilde for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of young ladies. He was befriended by the royal family, who not only assisted him financially, but gave him the celebrated Mount Valerian, at that time the center of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and later one of the principal forts protecting the capital.

<p>In 1830 during the second Revolution the Missionaries of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> were dispersed and exiled, and their house in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> sacked. Father Rauzan went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he received a paternal reception from <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, who encouraged and authorized him to found a new <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, to be known as the Fathers of Mercy. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>, which also contains the constitutions, was given 18 February, 1834, and on the 15th of March of the very same year a second <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, affiliating the new <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, and the former Missionaries of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> accepted these constitutions on the 8th of December the following. Among its members have been such influential and eloquent preachers as Mgr. Faillet, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, Mgr. Duquesnay, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, Mgr. Bernadon, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>, who later became a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. The Fathers of Mercy resumed their missionary labours in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, only to meet again the disasters which befell all religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> through the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of expulsion in 1880. However, through the influence of their many friends in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and claiming the enforcement of the authorization given to the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> by Louis XVIII in 1816, the Fathers of Mercy retained their mother-house in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> until the separation of the <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> in 1905, when they moved to <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>.

<p>In 1839, at the suggestion of Bishop Hughes, of New York, Mgr. Forbin-Janson introduced the Fathers of Mercy into the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, their first field of labour being in the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>. Bishop Potiers, of <a href="../cathen/10410a.htm">Mobile</a>, <a href="../cathen/01240a.htm">Alabama</a>, then invited them to take charge of Spring Hill college. Two years later, Fathers Lafont and Aubril were sent to look after the increasing French population in New York City, where the Fathers of Mercy now have charge of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, Manhattan, and of Our Lady of Lourdes and St. Francis de Chantal, Brooklyn. They also have a house of studies in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, houses in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and other places. By a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> (August, 1906) The Very Rev. Theophile Wucher was named Vicar General of the Institute for three years and took up residence in New York. In their activities the Fathers of Mercy embrace all works of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a>. One of their chief characteristics is, that they must at all times consider themselves auxiliaries of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, and in every way conform to the will of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in whose diocese they may labour. The end and mode of life the congregation imposes upon its members differs little from that of every good <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a>.
