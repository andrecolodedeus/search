<h1>The Feast of the Assumption</h1>  

<p>The Feast of the Assumption of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a>, 15 August; also called in old <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> <em>Pausatio</em>, <em>Nativitas</em> (for <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>), <em>Mors</em>, <em>Depositio</em>, <em>Dormitio S. Mariae</em>.

<p>This <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> has a double object: (1) the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> departure of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> from this <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>; (2) the assumption of her body into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. It is the principal <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>.
<h2>The fact of the Assumption</h2>

<p>Regarding the day, year, and manner of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady's</a> death, nothing <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. The earliest <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> literary reference to the Assumption is found in the Greek work <em>De Obitu S. Dominae</em>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, however, has always derived our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> from <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Apostolic Tradition</a>. <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">Epiphanius</a> (d. 403) acknowledged that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing definite about it (Haer., lxxix, 11). The <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dates</a> assigned for it vary between three and fifteen years after <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Christ's Ascension</a>. Two cities claim to be the place of her departure: <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and Ephesus. Common consent favours <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, where her <a href="../cathen/14774a.htm">tomb</a> is shown; but some argue in favour of Ephesus. The first six centuries did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14774a.htm">tomb of Mary</a> at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the corporeal assumption of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> is founded on the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> treatise <em>De Obitu S. Dominae</em>, bearing the name of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John</a>, which belongs however to the fourth or fifth century. It is also found in the book <em>De Transitu Virginis</em>, falsely ascribed to <a href="../cathen/10166b.htm">St. Melito of Sardis</a>, and in a spurious letter attributed to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">St. Denis the Areopagite</a>. If we consult <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">genuine</a> writings in the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">East</a>, it is mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> of <a href="../cathen/01473b.htm">St. Andrew of Crete</a>, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a>, St. Modestus of Jerusalem and others. In the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a>, <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a> (De gloria mart., I, iv) mentions it first. The <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> for this <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a>, however, are spurious. <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John of Damascus</a> (P.G., I, 96) thus formulates the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>:

<blockquote><p>St. Juvenal, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, at the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451), made known to the <a href="../cathen/09644a.htm">Emperor Marcian</a> and <a href="../cathen/12561c.htm">Pulcheria</a>, who wished to possess the body of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, that <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> died in the presence of all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, but that her <a href="../cathen/14774a.htm">tomb</a>, when opened, upon the request of <a href="../cathen/14658b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, was found empty; wherefrom the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> concluded that the body was taken up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. </p></blockquote>

<p>Today, the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the corporeal assumption of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> is universal in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">East</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a>; according to <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (De Festis B.V.M., I, viii, 18) it is a probable opinion, which to deny were impious and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a>.
<h2>The feast of the Assumption</h2>

<p>Regarding the origin of the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> we are also uncertain. It is more probably the anniversary of the <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedication</a> of some <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> than the actual anniversary of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady's</a> death. That it originated at the time of the <a href="../cathen/05491a.htm">Council of Ephesus</a>, or that <a href="../cathen/04613a.htm">St. Damasus</a> introduced it in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is only a hypothesis.

<p>According to the <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> of St. Theodosius (d. 529) it was celebrated in Palestine before the year 500, probably in August (<a href="../cathen/02202a.htm">Baeumer</a>, Brevier, 185). In <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and <a href="../cathen/01674a.htm">Arabia</a>, however, it was kept in January, and since the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> adopted many usages from the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> (<a href="../cathen/02202a.htm">Baeumer</a>, Brevier, 163), we find this <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> in the sixth century, in January [<em>mediante mense undecimo</em> (Greg. Turon., De gloria mart., I, ix)]. The <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gallican</a> <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Liturgy</a> has it on the 18th of January, under the title: <em>Depositio, Assumptio, or Festivitas S. Mariae</em> (cf. the notes of <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> on the <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gallican</a> <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Liturgy</a>, P.L., LXXII, 180). This <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> was kept up in the <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gallican Church</a> to the time of the introduction of the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">Roman rite</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, it seems, some kept this <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> in January, with the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; others in August, with those of Palestine; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/10069a.htm">Emperor Maurice</a> (d. 602), if the account of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> (II, 508) be correct, set the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Greek Empire</a> on 15 August.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Batiffol, Brev. Rom., 134) the oldest and only <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> was 1 January, the <a href="../cathen/11204a.htm">octave</a> of <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christ's birth</a>. It was celebrated first at Santa Maria Maggiore, later at Santa Maria ad Martyres. The other <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feasts</a> are of <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine</a> origin. Duchesne thinks (Origines du culte chr., 262) that before the seventh century no other <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> was kept at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and that consequently the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the Assumption, found in the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">sacramentaries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06407a.htm">Gelasius</a> and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, is a spurious addition made in the eighth or seventh century. Probst, however (Sacramentarien, 264 sqq.), brings forth good arguments to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that the <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a>, found on the 15th of August in the Gelasianum, is genuine, since it does not mention the corporeal assumption of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>; that, consequently, the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> was celebrated in the church of Santa Maria Maggiore at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at least in the sixth century. He <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proves</a>, furthermore, that the <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> of the Gregorian Sacramentary, such as we have it, is of <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gallican</a> origin (since the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the bodily assumption of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Mary</a>, under the influence of the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> writings, is older in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> than in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>), and that it supplanted the old Gelasian Mass. At the time of <a href="../cathen/13728b.htm">Sergius I</a> (700) this <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> was one of the principal <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">festivities</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> started from the church of St. Hadrian. It was always a double of the first class and a <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">Holy Day</a> of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11204a.htm">octave</a> was added in 847 by <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Leo IV</a>; in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> this <a href="../cathen/11204a.htm">octave</a> was not observed in several <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> up to the time of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Church of Milan</a> has not accepted it up to this day (Ordo Ambros., 1906). The <a href="../cathen/11204a.htm">octave</a> is <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privileged</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">provinces</a> of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienna</a>, <a href="../cathen/06043c.htm">Fermo</a>, <a href="../cathen/10282a.htm">Michoacan</a>, etc.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> continues this <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> to 23 August, inclusive, and in some <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Mount Athos</a> it is protracted to 29 August (Menaea Graeca, Venice, 1880), or was, at least, formerly. In the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> a thirtieth day (a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of month's <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>) of the Assumption was celebrated during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, 13 Sept., with the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a> of the Assumption (double); today, only the <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Diocese of Augsburg</a> has retained this old <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a>.

<p>Some of the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and those of <a href="../cathen/02738c.htm">Brandenburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, etc., on 23 Sept. kept the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the "Second Assumption", or the "Fortieth Day of the Assumption" (double) <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">revelations</a> of <a href="../cathen/05392a.htm">St. Elizabeth of Sch&ouml;nau</a> (d. 1165) and of St. Bertrand, O.C. (d. 1170), that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">B.V. Mary</a> was taken up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> on the fortieth day after her death (Grotefend, Calendaria 2, 136). The <a href="../cathen/02785a.htm">Brigittines</a> kept the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the "Glorification of Mary" (double) 30 Aug., since <a href="../cathen/02782a.htm">St. Brigitta of Sweden</a> says (Revel., VI, l) that <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> was taken into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> fifteen days after her departure (Colvenerius, Cal. Mar., 30 Aug.). In Central America a special <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the Coronation of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> (double major) is celebrated 18 August. The city of <a href="../cathen/06464a.htm">Gerace</a> in Calabria keeps three successive days with the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> of a double first class, commemorating: 15th of August, the death of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>; 16th of August, her Coronation.

<p>At <a href="../cathen/12072c.htm">Piazza</a>, in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, there is a commemoration of the Assumption of Mary (double second class) the 20th of February, the anniversary of the earthquake of 1743. A similar <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> (double major with <a href="../cathen/11204a.htm">octave</a>) is kept at Martano, <a href="../cathen/11351c.htm">Diocese of Otranto</a>, in Apulia, 19th of November.

<p class="stiki"><em>Note:</em> By <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgating</a> the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> Munificentissimus Deus, 1 November, 1950, Pope Pius XII declared <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibly</a> that the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary was a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Likewise, the Second Vatican Council taught in the Dogmatic Constitution Lumen Gentium that "the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Immaculate Virgin</a>, preserved free from all stain of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, was taken up body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, when her earthly <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> was over, and exalted by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> as Queen over all things (n. 59)."</p>
