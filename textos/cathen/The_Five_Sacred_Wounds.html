<h1>The Five Sacred Wounds</h1>  

<h2>Devotion</h2>

<p>The revival of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> activity of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> and St. Francis in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, together with the enthusiasm of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a> returning from the Holy Land, gave a wonderful impulse to devotion to the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Jesus Christ</a> and particularly to practices in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Wounds in His Sacred Hands, Feet, and Side. The reason for this devotion was well expressed at a later period in the memorial of the Polish <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a>:

<blockquote><p>"Moreover, the Five Wounds of Christ are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by a Mass and an Office, and on account of these wounds we venerate also the feet, hands and side of the most loving Redeemer, these parts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> most holy body being held more worthy of a special cult than the others, precisely because they suffered special pains for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and because they are decorated with these wounds as with an illustrious mark of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Therefore, with living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> they cannot be looked upon without a special feeling of religion and devotion" (<a href="../cathen/11078a.htm">Nilles</a>, "De rat. fest. SS. Cord. Jesu et Mariae", I, 126).</p></blockquote>

<p>Many beautiful <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Sacred Wounds, including some attributed to <a href="../cathen/04004a.htm">St. Clare of Assisi</a> (<a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgenced</a> on 21 November, 1885), have been preserved. <a href="../cathen/10105b.htm">St. Mechtilde</a> and St. Gertrude of Helfta were devoted to the Holy Wounds, the latter saint reciting daily a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the 5466 wounds, which, according to a <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> tradition, were inflicted on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> during His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. In the fourteenth century it was customary in southern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> to recite fifteen Pater Nosters each day (which thus amounted to 5475 in the course of a year) in memory of the Sacred Wounds. Corresponding to the Mass "Humiliavit" in the Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, there was in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Missals a special Mass in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Wounds, believed to have been composed by <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a> and revealed to <a href="../cathen/02660a.htm">Boniface II</a> (532). It was known as the Golden Mass, and was <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgenced</a> by <a href="../cathen/08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a> (1362) or <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> (1334); during its celebration five candles were always lighted. It was popularly held that if anyone should say or hear it on five consecutive days he should never suffer the pains of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell fire</a> (Franz, "Messe im Mittelalter", 159).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Dominican Rosary</a> also helped to promote devotion to the Sacred Wounds, for while the fifty small beads refer to Mary, the five large beads and the corresponding Pater Nosters are intended to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Five Wounds of Christ (Beissel, "Verehrung Marias", I, 525). Again, in some places it was customary to ring a bell at noon on Fridays, to remind the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to recite five Paters and Aves in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Holy Wounds. A corona, or <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">rosary</a>, of the Five Wounds was approved by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> on 11 August, 1823, and again in 1851. It consists of five divisions, each composed of five Glories in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Wounds and one Ave in commemoration of the Sorrowful Mother. The blessing of the beads is reserved to the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a>.
<h2>Feast</h2>

<p>The earliest evidence of a feast in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Wounds of Christ comes from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Fritzlar, <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>, where in the fourteenth century a feast was kept on the Friday after the octave of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>. The Office was rhythmical (Dreves, "Anal. hymnica", XXIV, 20; Grotefend, "Zeitrechnung", II, 1, 115). In the fifteenth century it had spread to different countries, to Salisbury (England), <a href="../cathen/07513a.htm">Huesca</a> and Jaca (Spain), <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and Tours, and was included in the Breviaries of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, and other orders (Dreves, op. cit., XXIV, XL, XLII). The Feast of the Five Wounds, celebrated since the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> at <a href="../cathen/05670a.htm">Evora</a> and elsewhere in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> on 6 February (at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> on the Friday after <a href="../cathen/01775b.htm">Ash-Wednesday</a>) is of historical interest. It commemorates the founding of the Portuguese kingdom in 1139, when, before the battle on the plains of Ourique, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> appeared to Alfonso Henriquez, promising victory over the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> and commanding him to insert into the <a href="../cathen/07243a.htm">coat of arms</a> of the new kingdom the emblem of the Five Wounds ("Propr. Portugalliae" in Weiss, "Weltgeschichte", III, 251). This feast is celebrated today in all Portuguese-speaking countries. The Proprium of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> of 1766, which contains perhaps the earliest series of movable feasts in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, has the Feast of the Five Wounds on the second <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> in March; it was granted in 1809 to Leghorn for the Friday after <a href="../cathen/01775b.htm">Ash-Wednesday</a>, on which day it is still kept in many <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, and elsewhere (Mexico). Since 1831, when the feasts in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Passion were adopted at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a> and the city, this <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> was assigned to the Friday after the third <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>. The Office is one of those bequeathed to us by the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. As this feast is not celebrated in the entire <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a> and <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> are placed in the appendix of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>.
