<h1>The French Concordat of 1801</h1>  

<p>This name is given to the convention of the 26th Messidor, year IX (July 16, 1802), whereby <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pope Pius VII</a> and <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a>, First Consul, re-established the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a> understood that the restoration of religious peace was above all things <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the peace of the country. The hostility of the Vendeans to the new state of affairs which resulted from the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> was due chiefly to the fact that their <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> consciences were outraged by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolutionary</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Of the 136 sees of ancient <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> a certain number had lost their titulars by death; the titulars of many others had been forced to <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrate</a>. In <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Notre-Dame and the church of St-Sulpice were in the possession of "constitutional" <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; Royer, a "constitutional" <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, had taken the place of Mgr. de Juign&eacute;, the lawful <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, an <em>&eacute;migr&eacute;;</em> even in the churches which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had recovered, the rites of the <a href="../cathen/14624a.htm">"Theophilanthropists"</a> and those of the "Decadi" were also celebrated. The nation suffered from this religious <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a>, and the wishes of the people coincided with <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte's</a> projected policy to restore the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship to their normal condition in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.
<h2 id="section1">The first advances</h2>

<p>On the 25th of June, 1800, <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a>, after his victory at Marengo, passed through <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>, where he paid a visit to Cardinal Martiniana, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that city. He asked that <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> to go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and inform <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> that <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a> wished to make him a present of thirty million <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; that the first consul desired to reorganize the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, while lessening their number; that the <em>&eacute;migr&eacute;</em> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should be induced to resign their sees; that <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> should have a new <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> untrammelled by past political conditions; that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> should be restored. Martiniana faithfully reported these words to <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>. It was only a few months before that <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> had died at <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> of <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">revolutionary France</a>. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, when elected at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, had announced his accession to the legitimate government of Louis XVIII, not to that of the Republic; and now <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a>, the representative of this <em>de facto</em> government, was making overtures of peace to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> on the very morrow of his great victory. His action naturally caused the greatest surprise at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The difficulties in the way, however, were very serious. They arose, chiefly;

<p>(1) from the susceptibilities of the <em>&eacute;migr&eacute;</em> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, from the future Louis XVIII, and from <a href="../cathen/10072c.htm">Cardinal Maury</a>, who was suspicious of any attempt at reconciliation between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> and the new <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>;

<p>(2) from the susceptibilities of the former revolutionaries, now the courtiers of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, but still imbued with the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">irreligious philosophy</a> of the eighteenth century.

<p>The distinctive mark of the negotiations, taken as a whole, is the fact that the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, whether still abroad or returned to their own country, had no heart whatever in them. The <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">concordat</a> as finally arranged practically ignored their existence.
<h2 id="section2">The three phases of the negotiations</h2>
<h3>First phase (5 November, 1800-10 March, 1801)</h3>

<p>Spina, titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, accompanied by Caselli, General of the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a>, arrived in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, on 5 November, 1800. Bernier, who had been <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Saint-Laud, at <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a>, and famous for the part he had played in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of La Vend&eacute;e, was instructed by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a> to confer with Spina. Four proposals for a concordat were submitted in turn to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> representative, who felt that he had no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to sign them without referring them to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Finally, after numerous delays, for which Talleyrand was responsible, a fifth proposal, written by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> himself, was brought to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, on 10 March, by the courier Palmoni.
<h3>Second phase (10 March, 1801-6 June, 1801)</h3>

<p>Cacault, member of the <em>Corps Legislatif</em>, appointed as minister plenipotentiary to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, reached <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 8 April, 1801. He had received instructions from <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> to treat the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as if he had 200,000 men. He was a good <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and anxious to bring the work of the concordat to a successful issue. What <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a> wished, however, was the immediate acceptance by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> of his plan of the concordat; on the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to whom <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> had submitted it took two months to study it. On 12 May, 1801, the very day on which <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, at Malmaison, was complaining to Spina of the slowness of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to whom the proposed concordat had been submitted sent yet another proposal to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. But, before this last proposal had reached its destination, Cacault received an ultimatum from Talleyrand, to the effect that he must leave <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> if, after an interval of five days, the concordat proposed by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a> had not been signed by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>. All might, even then, have been broken off, had the situation not been saved by Cacault. He left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, leaving his secretary <a href="../cathen/10544b.htm">Artaud</a> there, but suggested to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of sending <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a> himself, Secretary of State to <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, to treat with <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a>. On 6 June, 1801, Artaud and <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a> left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the same carriage.


<h3>Third phase (6 June, 1801-15 July, 1801)</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a>, after an audience with <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a>, discussed the various points of the proposed concordat with Bernier, and on 12 July they had reached an agreement. <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a> thereupon instructed his brother Joseph, Cretet, councillor of state, and Bernier to sign the concordat with <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a>, Spina, and Caselli. During the day of the 13th, Bernier sent <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a> a minute, adding: "Here is what they will propose to you at first; read it well, examine everything, despair of nothing." Between this minute and the proposal concerning which <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a> and Bernier had come to the agreement of the day before, there were certain remarkable differences with regard to the publicity of worship; a clause relative to married <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and always rejected by <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a>, was inserted; the clauses relating to <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, to chapters, and that of the profession of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> by the consuls, to which the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> attached great importance were suppressed. <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a> received the impression &#151; he expresses it in his "Memoirs", written in 1812 &#151; that the French Government intended to deceive him by substituting a fresh text for the text he had accepted; and d'Haussonville, in his book, "The Roman Church and the First Empire", has formally impugned the <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte's</a> representatives. Bernier's aforementioned note of 13 July, recently discovered by <a href="../cathen/10048a.htm">Cardinal Mathieu</a>, asking <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a> to "read" and "examine" carefully, proves that the French Government did not intend any deception; nevertheless, the presentation of this new draft reopened the whole question. Talleyrand had taken the initiative in this matter; for twenty consecutive hours <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte's</a> three plenipotentiaries and those of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> carried on their discussion. The plan on which they finally agreed was thrown into the fire by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a>, who that evening, at dinner, gave way to a violent fit of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> against <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a>. Finally, on 15 July, a conference of twelve hours ended in a definite agreement; on the 16th <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a> approved of it. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, on his part, after consultation with the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, sanctioned this arrangement, 11 August; on 10 September the signatures were exchanged, and on 18 April, 1802, <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a> caused the publication of the concordat and the reconciliation of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to be solemnly celebrated in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Notre-Dame at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>.
<h2 id="section3">The stipulations of the Concordat</h2>

<p>The French Government by the concordat recognized the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion as the religion <em>of the great majority of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a>.</em> The phrase was no longer as in former times, <em>the religion of the State.</em> But it was a question of <em>a personal profession of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> on the part of the Consuls of the Republic.</em> The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> had insisted on this mention, and it was only on this condition that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> agreed to grant to the State police power in the matter of public worship. This question had been one of the most troublesome that arose during the course of the deliberations. In the matter of these police powers it had been agreed after many difficulties that the following should stand as Article I of the concordat: "The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, Apostolic and Roman Religion shall be freely exercised in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Its worship shall be public while conforming to such police regulations as the government shall consider <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to public tranquillity." The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> agreed to a fresh circumscription of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. When this subsequently took place, of the 136 sees only 60 were retained. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> promised to inform the actual titulars of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> that he should expect from them every sacrifice, even that of their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>.

<p>According to Articles 4 and 5 the French Government was to present the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was to give them <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a>. (See PRESENTATION; <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">CANONICAL INSTITUTION</a>; <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">NOMINATION</a>.) The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were to appoint as <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> only as were acceptable to the Government (Art. 9); the latter, in turn, stipulated that such churches as had not been alienated, and were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for worship, would be placed "at the disposition" of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (Art. 12).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> agreed not to trouble the consciences of those citizens who, during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, had become possessed of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> (Art. 13); on the other hand the Government promised the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> a fitting maintenance (<em>sustentationem,</em> Art. 14).

<p>Such were the principal stipulations of the concordat. Certain of its articles have been fully discussed, particularly by canonists and jurists, notably Articles 5, 12, and 14, relating to the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the use of churches, and the maintenance of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> known as "The Organic Articles" (see <a href="../cathen/01756a.htm">THE ORGANIC ARTICLES</a>), <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in April, 1802, and always upheld by later French governments in spite of the protest of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, made immediately after its publication, has in various ways infringed on the spirit of the concordat and given rise during the nineteenth century to frequent disputes between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.
<h2 id="section4">Result of the Concordat</h2>

<p>The concordat, notwithstanding the addition of the <a href="../cathen/01756a.htm">Organic Articles</a>, must be credited with having restored peace to the consciences of the French people on the very morrow of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. To it also was due the reorganization of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, under the protection of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. It was also of great moment in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a>. Only a few years after Josephinism and <a href="../cathen/06023a.htm">Febronianism</a> had disputed the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to govern the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the Papacy and the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> and <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, came to an understanding which gave <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> a new episcopate and marked the final defeat of Gallicanism.
<h2 id="section5">Fate of the Concordat</h2>

<p>The French law of 9 December, 1905, on the Separation of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, against which <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> protested in his Allocution of 11 December, 1905, was based on the principle that the State of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> should no longer recognize the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but only distinct <em>associations cultuelles,</em> i.e. associations formed in each <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> for the purpose of worship "in accordance with the rules governing the organization of worship in general". In case of the non-formation of such associations destined to take over the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, real and personal, of the churches or <em>fabriques</em> (see <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">ECCLESIASTICAL BUILDINGS</a>; FABRICA ECCLESI&AElig;), this <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was to be forever lost to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and to be turned over by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> to the charitable establishments of the respective communes. By the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Gravissimo Officii", of 10 August, 1906, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> forbade the formation of these <em>associations cultuelles</em> or associations for worship. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> feared that they would furnish the State with a pretext for interfering with the internal life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and would offer to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> a constant temptation to control the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. Thereupon, the State applied strictly the aforementioned law, considered the <em>fabriques,</em> i.e. the hitherto legally-recognized churches, as no longer existing, and, in the absence of <em>associations cultuelles</em> to take up their inheritance, gave over all their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to charitable establishments (<em>&eacute;tablissements de bienfaisance</em>). Exception was made for the church edifices actually used for worship; at the same time nothing was done concerning the numberless legal questions that arise apropos of these edifices, e.g. right of ownership, right of use, repairs, etc. At the present writing, therefore (end of 1908), the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, stripped of all her <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, is barely tolerated in her <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">religious edifices</a>, and has only a precarious enjoyment of them. On the other hand, since <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority has forbidden the only kind of corporations (<em>associations cultuelles</em>) which the State recognizes as authorized to collect funds for purposes of worship, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has no means of putting together in a legal and regular way such funds or capital as may be required for the ordinary needs of public worship. Thus the churches of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> live from day to day; neither the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> nor the diocese can own any fund, however small, which the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is free to hand down to his successors; all this because the State stubbornly insists that only the above-described <em>associations cultuelles</em> (which it knows are impossible for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>) shall be clothed with the right of ownership for purposes of worship. Though the present condition is necessarily a transitory one, it appears, unfortunately, to offer one permanent element, i.e. the certain loss of all the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> once belonging to the <em>fabriques.</em> The worst enemies of the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> must admit that, in order to safeguard its principles, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which they accuse of <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> has sacrificed without hesitation all its temporal goods.
