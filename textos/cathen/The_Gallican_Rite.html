<h1>The Gallican Rite</h1>  

<p>This subject will be treated under the following six heads:

<blockquote><p>I. History and Origin; <br>II. Manuscripts and Other Sources; <br>III. The Liturgical Year; <br>IV. The Divine Office; <br>V. The Mass; <br>VI. The Occasional Services.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="section1">History and origin</h2>

<p>The name <em>Gallican Rite</em> is given to the rite which prevailed in Gaul from the earliest times of which we have any information until about the middle or end of the eighth century. there is no information before the fifth century and very little then; and throughout the whole period there was, to judge by existing documents and descriptions, so much diversity that, though the general outlines of the rite were of the same pattern, the name must not be taken to imply more than a very moderate amount of homogeneity. The Rite of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, fairly widely used from the fifth century to the end of the eleventh, and still lingering on as an archaeological survival in <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> at Toledo and Salamanca, was so nearly allied to the Gallican Rite that the term <em>Hispano Gallican</em> is often applied to the two. But the Spanish Mozarabic Rite has, like the allied Celtic, enough of an independent history to require separate treatment, so that though it will be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to allude to both by way of illustration, this article will be devoted primarily to the rite once used in what is now <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Of the origin of the Gallican Rite there are three principle theories, between two of which the controversy is not yet settled. These may be termed (1) the Ephesine, (2) the Ambrosian, and (3) the Roman theories.

<p>(1) The first has been already mentioned under <a href="../cathen/01394a.htm">AMBROSIAN RITE</a> and <a href="../cathen/03493a.htm">CELTIC RITE</a>. This theory, which was first put forward by Sir W. Palmer in his "Origines Liturgicae", which was once very popular among <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a>. According to it the Gallican Rite was referred to an original brought to Lyons from Ephesus by St. Pothinus and St. Iren&aelig;us, who had received it through <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">St. Polycarp</a> from St. John the Divine. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> originated partly in a statement in the eighth century tract in Cott. <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> Nero A. II in the British Museum, which refers the Gallican <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> (<em>Cursus Gallorum</em>) to such an origin, and partly in a statement of Coleman at the <a href="../cathen/15610a.htm">Synod of Whitby</a> (664) respecting the Johannine origin of the Celtic <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. The Cottonian tract is of little or no historical value; Coleman's notion was disproved at the time by St. Wilfred; and the Ephesine theory has now been given up by all serious liturgiologists. Mgr Duchesne, and his "Origines de culte chr&eacute;tien", has finally disposed of the possibility of so complicated a rite as the Gallican having so early an origin as the second century.

<p>(2) The second theory is that which Duchesne puts forward in the place of the Ephesine. He holds that <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, not Lyons, was the principal centre of Gallican development. He lays great stress on the incontestable importance of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> in the late fourth century, and conjectures that a liturgy of Oriental origin, introduced perhaps by the Cappadocian Auxentius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> from 355 to 374, spread from that centre to <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and Britain. He points out that "the Gallican Liturgy in the features which distinguish it from the Roman, betrays all the characteristics of the Eastern <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>," and that "some of its formularies are to be found word for word in the Greek texts which were in use in the Churches of the Syro-Byzantine Rite either in the fourth century or somewhat later", and infers from this that, "the Gallican Liturgy is an Oriental liturgy, introduced into the West towards the middle of the fourth century". not, he does not, however, note that in certain other important peculiarities the Gallican Liturgy agrees with the Roman where the latter differs from the Oriental. Controverting the third or Roman theory of origin, he lays some stress upon the fact that Pope St. Innocent I (416) in his letter to Decentius of <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">Gubbio</a> spoke of usages which Mgr Duchesne recognizes as Gallican (e.g. the position of the Diptychs and the Pax), as "foreign importations" and did not recognize in them the ancient usage of his own Church, and he thinks it hard to explain why the African Church should have accepted the Roman reforms, while <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> himself a Roman. refused them. He assumes that the Ambrosian Rite is not really Roman, but Gallican, much Romanized at a later period, and that the Giubbio variations of which <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">St. Innocent</a> complained were borrowed from <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>.

<p>(3) The third theory is perhaps rather complicated to state without danger of misrepresentation, and has not been so definitely stated as the other two by any one writer. It is held in part by Probst, Father Lucas, the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> liturgiologists, and many others whose opinion is of weight. In order to state it clearly it will be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to point out first certain details in which all the Latin or Western rites agree with one another in differing from the Eastern, and in this we speak only of the Mass, which is of far more importance than either the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, or the occasional services in determining origins. The Eastern Eucharistic offices of whatever rite are marked by the invariability of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> part. There are, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, alternative <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">anaphoras</a> which are used either <em>ad libitum</em>, as in the Syro-Jacobite Rite, or on certain days, as in Byzantine and East Syrian, but they are complete in themselves and do not contain passages appropriate to the day. The lections of course vary with the day in all rites, and varying <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, troparia, etc., are sung by the choir; but the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> part remains fixed. In the Western rites, whether Hispano-Gallican, Ambrosian, or Roman, a very large proportion of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> part varies according to the day, and, as will be seen by the analysis of its Mass in this article, these variations are so numerous in the Gallican Rite that the fixed part even of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> of the Consecration is strangely little. Certain of the varying <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the Hispano-Gallican Rite have a tendency to fall into couples, a Bidding Prayer, or invitation to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, sometimes of considerable length and often partaking of the nature of a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a>, addressed to the congregation, and a collect embodying the suggestions of the Bidding Prayer, addressed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. These Bidding <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayers</a> have survived in the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> of today in the <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> intercessory <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and they occur in a form borrowed later from the Gallican, in the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> services, but in general the invitation to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is reduced to its lowest terms in the word <em>Oremus</em>. Another Western peculiarity is in the form of the recital of the Institution. The principal Eastern <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> follow <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> words in <a href="../bible/1co011.htm#vrs23">1 Corinthians 11:23-25</a>, and date the Institution by the betrayal, <em>en te nykti, he paredidoto</em> (in the night in which He was betrayed), and of the less important <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">anaphoras</a>, most either use the same expression or paraphrase it. The Western <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> date from the Passion, <em>Qui pridie quam pateretur</em>, for which, though of course the fact is found there, there is no verbal Scriptural warrant. The Mozarabic of today uses the Pauline words, and no Gallican Recital of the Institution remains in full; but in both the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that follows is called (with alternative nomenclature in the Gallican) <em>Post Pridie</em> and the catchwords "Qui pridie" come at the end of the Post-Sanctus in the Gallican Masses, so that it is clear that this form existed in both. These variations from the Eastern usages are of an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, and it is inferred from them, and from other considerations more historical than <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a>, that a liturgy with these peculiarities was the common <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of Gaul, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Whether, as is most likely, it originated in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and spread thence to the countries under direct Roman influence, or whether it originated elsewhere and was adopted by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, there is no means of knowing. The adoption must have happened when <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> were in rather a fluid state. The Gallicans may have carried to an extreme the changes begun at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and may have retained some archaic features (now often mistaken for Orientalisms) which had been later dropped by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. At some period in the fourth century &#151; it has been conjectured that it was in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> of St. Damasus (366-84) &#151; reforms were made at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the position of the Great Intercession and of the Pax were altered, the latter, perhaps because the form of the dismissal of the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> was disused, and the distinction between the <em>missa catechumenorum</em> and the <em>missa fidelium</em> was no longer needed, and therefore the want was felt of a position with some meaning to it for the sign of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> unity, and the long and diffuse <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were made into the short and crisp collects of the Roman type. It was then that the variable Post-Sanctus and Post-Pridie were altered into a fixed Canon of a type similar to the <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">Roman Canon</a> of today, though perhaps this Canon began with the clause which now reads, "Quam oblationem", but according to the pseudo-Ambrosian tract "De Sacramentis" once read "Fac nobis hanc oblationem". This may have been introduced by a short variable Post-Sanctus. This reform, possibly through the influence of St. Ambrose, was adopted at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, but not in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. At a still later period changes were again made at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. They have been principally attributed to <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo</a> (440-61), St. Gelasius (492-96), and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> (590-604), but the share these <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> had in the reforms is not definitely known, though three varying <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">sacramentaries</a> have been called by their respective names. These later reforms were not adopted at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, which retained the books of the first reform, which are now known as Ambrosian.



<p>Hence it may be seen that, roughly speaking, the Western or Latin Liturgy went through three phases, which may be called for want of better names the Gallican, the Ambrosian, and the Roman stages. The holders of the theory no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> recognize quite clearly that the line of demarcation between these stages is rather a vague one, and that the alterations were in many respects gradual. Of the three theories of origin of the Ephesine may be dismissed as practically disproved. To both of the other two the same objection may be urged, that they are largely founded on conjecture and on the critical examination of documents of a much later date than the periods to which the conjectures relate. But at present there is little else to go upon. It may be well to mention also a theory put forward by Mr. W.C. Bishop in the "Church Quarterly" for July, 1908, to the effect that the Gallican Liturgy was not introduced into Gaul from anywhere, but was the original liturgy of that country, apparently invented and developed there. He speaks of an original independence of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (of course liturgically only) followed by later borrowings. This does not seem to exclude the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the West may have had the germ of the Western Rite in common. Again the theory is conjectural and is only very slightly stated in the article. The later history of the Gallican Rite until the time of its abolition as a separate rite is obscure. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> there was a definite centre in Toledo, whose influence was felt over the whole peninsula, even after the coming of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>. Hence it was that the Spanish Rite was much more regulated than the Gallican, and Toledo at times, though not very successfully, tried to give <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> even to <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, though probably only to the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> part of it. In the greater part of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> there was <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a>. There was no capital to give <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> to the whole country, and the rite developed there variously in various places, so that among the scanty fragments of the service-books that remain there is a marked absence of verbal uniformity, though the main outlines of the services are of the same type. Several councils attempted to regulate matters a little, but only for certain provinces. Among these were the Councils of <a href="../cathen/15271b.htm">Vannes</a> (465), <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Agde</a> (506), Vaison (529), Tours (567), Auxerre (578), and the two Councils of <a href="../cathen/09507a.htm">M&acirc;con</a> (581, 623). But all along there went on a certain process of Romanizing due to the constant applications to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for advice, and there is also another complication in the probable introduction during the seventh century, through the Columbanine missionaries of elements of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> origin. The changes towards the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> happened rather gradually during the course of the late seventh and eighth century, and seem synchronous with the rise of the <em>Maires du Palais</em>, and their development into Kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Nearly all the Gallican books of the later Merovingian period, which are all that are left, contain many Roman elements. In some cases there is reason to suppose that the <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">Roman Canon</a> was first introduced into an otherwise Gallican Mass, but the so-called Gelasian Sacramentary, the principle <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of which is attributed to the Abbey of St. Dennis and the early eighth century, is an avowedly Roman book, though containing Gallican additions and adaptations. And the same may be said of what is left of the undoubtedly <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> book known as the "Missale Francorum" of the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. Mgr Duchesne attributes a good deal of this eighth-century Romanizing tendency to <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, though he shows that it had begun before his day. The Roman Liturgy was adopted at <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> in the time of <a href="../cathen/03729b.htm">St. Chrodegang</a> (742-66). the Roman chant was introduced about 760, and by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of Pepin, quoted in <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> "Admonitio Generalis" in 789, the Gallican chant was abolished in its favour. <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Pope Adrian I</a> between 784 and 791 sent to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> at his own request a copy of what was considered to be the Sacramentary of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, but which certainly represented the Roman use of the end of the eighth century. This book, which was far from complete, was edited and supplemented by the addition of a large amount of matter derived from the Gallican books and from the Roman book known as the Gelasian Sacramentary, which had been gradually supplanting the Gallican. It is probable that the editor was <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> principal <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> advisor, the Englishman <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>. Copies were distributed throughout <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> empire, and this "composite <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a>", as Mgr Duchesne says, "from its source in the Imperial <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> spread throughout all the churches of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire and at length, finding its way to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> gradually supplanted there the ancient use". More than half a century later, when Charles the Bald wished to see what the ancient Gallican Rite had been like, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to import <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to celebrate it in his presence.

<p>It should be noted that the name <em>Gallican</em> has also been applied to two other uses: (1) a French use introduced by the Normans into Apulia and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. This was only a variant of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>. (2) the reformed Breviaries of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in the seventeenth to mid-nineteenth centuries. These have nothing to do with the ancient Gallican Rite.
<h2 id="section2">Manuscripts and other sources</h2>

<p>There are no <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the Gallican Rite earlier than the later part of the seventh century, thought the descriptions in the letters of <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (555-76) take one back another century. The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are:--

<p>(1) <em>The <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> Fragments</em> (Carlsruhe, 253), described (no. 8) in Delisle's "M&eacute;moire sur d'anciens Sacramentaires." &#151; These were discovered by <a href="../cathen/10478b.htm">Mone</a> in 1850 in a palimpsest <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> from the Abbey of Rerichenau in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of Carlsruhe. The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, which is late seventh century, had belonged to John II, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> (760-81). It contains eleven Masses of purely Gallican type, one of which is in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06472b.htm">St. Germanus of Auxerre</a>, but the others do not specify any festival. One Mass, except the post Post-Pridie, which is in prose is entirely in hexameter verse. <a href="../cathen/10478b.htm">Mone</a> published them with a facsimile in his "Lateinische und Griechische Menssen aus dem zweiten bis sechsten Jahrhundert" (Frankfort 1850). They were reprinted in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne's</a> "Patrologia Latina" (Vol. CXXXVIII), and by Neale and Forbes in "The Ancient Liturgy of the Gallican Church" (Burntisland, 1855-67).

<p>(2) <em>The Peyron, Mai, and Bunsen Fragments.</em> Of these disjointed palimpsest leaves, those of <a href="../cathen/09538a.htm">Mai</a> and Peyron were found in the <a href="../cathen/01393a.htm">Ambrosian Library</a> at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and those of Bunsen at St. Gall. Peyron's were printed in his "M.T. Ciceronis Orationum Fragmenta inedita" (Stuttgart, 1824), Mai's in his "Scriptorum Veterum Vaticana Collectio", and Bunsen's in his "Analecta Ante-Niceana". All these were reprinted by C.E. Hammond: Peyron's and Bunsen's in his "Ancient Liturgy of Antioch" (Oxford, 1879), and Mai's in his "Ancient Liturgies" (Oxford, 1878). The latest are also in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne's</a> "Patrologia Latina" with <a href="../cathen/10478b.htm">Mone's</a> Riechenau fragments. the Peyron fragment contains part of what looks like a <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> Contestatio (Preface) with other <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of Gallican type. The Bunsen fragment contains part of a Mass for the Dead (Post-Sactus, Post Pridie) and several pairs of Bidding <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayers</a> and Collects, the former having the title "Exhortatio" or "Exhortatio Matutina. The <a href="../cathen/09538a.htm">Mai</a> fragments begin with part of a Bidding Prayer and contain a fragment of a <em>Contestatio</em>, with that title, and fragments of other <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, two of which have the title "Post Nomina", and two others which seem to be <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> "Ad Pacem".

<p>(3) <em>The Missale Gothicum</em> (Vatican, Queen Christina <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> 317). &#151; Described by Delisle, No. 3 A <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the end of the seventh century, which once belonged to the Petau Library. The name is due to a fifteenth century note at the beginning of the book, and hence it has been attributed by <a href="../cathen/06573a.htm">Tommasi</a> and <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> to Narbonne, which was in the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> Kingdom. Mgr Duchesne, judging by the inclusion of Masses for the feasts of St. Symphorian and St. L&eacute;ger (d. 680), attributes it to Autun. The Masses are numbered, the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> beginning with <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Eve</a>, which is numbered "III". Probably there were once two <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> Masses, as in the "Missale Gallicanum". There are eighty-one numbered sections, of which the last is the first <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of "Missa Romensif cottidiana", with which the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> breaks off. The details of the Masses in this book are given in the section of the present article on the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> year. The Masses are all Gallican as to order, but many of the actual <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are Roman. The "Missale Gothicum" has been printed by <a href="../cathen/06573a.htm">Tommasi</a> (Codices Sacramentorum, Rome, 1680), <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> (De Liturgi&acirc; Gallican&acirc;, Paris, 1685), Muratori (Liturgia Romana Vetus, Venice, 1748), Neale and Forbes (op. cit.), and <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne's</a> "Patrologia Latina" (Vol. LXXII).

<p>(4) <em>Missale Gallicanum Vetus</em> (Vatican. Palat. 493). &#151; Described by Delisle, No. 5 The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, which is of the end of the seventh, or the early part of the eighth, century is only a fragment. It begins with a Mass for the feast of <a href="../cathen/06472b.htm">St. Germanus of Auxerre</a> (9 Oct.), after which come <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the Blessing of Virgins and Widows, two <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> Masses, the <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Eve</a> Mass, the <em>Expositio</em> and <em>Traditio Symboli</em>, and other ceremonies preparatory to Baptism; The <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a>, <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> and <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a> ceremonies and the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> service, Masses for the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> after <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> up to the Rogation Mass, where the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> breaks off. The Masses, as in the <em>Gothicum</em>, are Gallican in order with many Roman <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are, with a few verbal variations, exactly those from the Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> has been printed by <a href="../cathen/06573a.htm">Tommasi</a>, <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a>, Muratori, and Neale and Forbes (op. cit.), and in Vol. LXXII of <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne's</a> "Patrologia Latina".

<p>(5) <em>The Lexeuil Lectinary</em> (Paris, Bibl. Nat., 9427). &#151; This <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, which is of the seventh century was discovered by <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> in the Abbey of Luxeuill, but from its containing among its very few <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints'</a> days the feast of <a href="../cathen/06413f.htm">St. Genevieve</a>, Dom Morin (Revue B&eacute;n&eacute;dictine, 1893) attributes it to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. It contains the Prophetical Lessons, epistles and Gospels for the year from <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Eve</a> onwards (for the details of which see the section of this article on the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> years). At the end are the lessons of a few special Masses, for the burial of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, for the dedication of a church, when a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> preaches, "et plebs decimas reddat", when a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> is <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, when a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is blessed, "in profectione itineris", and "lectiones cotidianae". This lectionary is purely Gallican with no apparent Roman influence. The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> has not been printed in its entirety, but <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> in "De Liturgi&acirc; Gallican&acirc; gives the references to all the lessons and the beginnings and endings of the text.

<p>(6) <em>The Letters of <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a></em>. &#151; These were printed by Martene (De Antiquis Ecclesiae Ritibus Bassano, 1788) from an <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> at <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, and are given also in Vol. LXXII of <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne's</a> "Patrologia Latina". There appears to be no reason to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that they are genuine. They contain mystical interpretations of the ceremonies of the Mass and of other services. Mgr Duchesne says of the descriptions, on which the interpretations are based, that "We may reconstruct from the letters a kind of <em>Ordo Gallicanus</em>". (See section of this article on the Mass.)

<p>Much side light is thrown on the Gallican Rite by the Celtic books (see <a href="../cathen/03493a.htm">CELTIC RITE</a>), especially by the Stowe and Bobbio Missals. The latter has been called Gallican and attributed to the Province of Besan&ccedil;on, but it is now held to be <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> in a much Romanized form, though of Continental <em>provenance</em>, being quite probably from the originally <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a>, where <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> found it. A comparison with the Ambrosian books (see <a href="../cathen/01394a.htm">AMBROSIAN LITURGY AND RITE</a>) may also be of service, while most lacunae in our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Gallican Rite may reasonably be conjecturally filled up from the Mozarabic books, which even in their present form are those of substantially the same rite. There are also <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> allusions in certain early writers: <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">St. Hilary of Poitiers</a>, St. Sulpicius Severus (d. about 400), <a href="../cathen/03135b.htm">St. Caesarius of Arles</a> (d. about 542), and especially <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a> (d. 595), and some information may be gathered from the decrees of the Gallican councils mentioned above.

<p>The above are all that exist as directly Gallican sources, but much information may also be gleaned from the books of the transition period, which, though substantially Roman, were much edited with Germanic tendencies and contained a large amount which was of a Gallican rather than a Roman type. The principal of these are:

<p>(1) <em>The Gelasian Sacramentary</em>, of which three <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> exist, one in the Vatican (Queen Christina <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> 316), and one at <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a> (Rheinau 30, and one at St.Gall (<a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> 348). The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are of the early eighth century. The groundwork is Roman, with Gallican additions and modifications. Evidence for the Gallican rites of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> and some other matters is derived from this book. The Vatican <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> was published by <a href="../cathen/06573a.htm">Tommasi</a> and Muratori, and a complete edition from all three <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> was edited by H. A. Wilson (Oxford, 1894).

<p>(2) <em>The Missale Francorum</em> (Vatican Q. Christina <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> 257, Delisle No. 4). &#151; A fragment of a Sacramentary of a similar type to the Gelasian, though not identical with it. Printed by <a href="../cathen/06573a.htm">Tommasi</a>, <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a>, and Muratori.

<p>(3) <em>The Gregorian Sacramentary</em>. &#151; Of this there are many <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> It represents the Sacramentary sent by <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Pope Adrian I</a> to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, after it had been rearranged and supplemented by Gelasian and Gallican editions in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. One <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of it was published by Muratori. In this, as in many others, the editions form a supplement, but in some (e.g. the Angoul&ecirc;me Sacramentary, Bibl. Nat. Lat. 816) the Gelasian additions are interpolated throughout.
<h2 id="section3">The liturgical year</h2>

<p>The Luxeuil Lectionary, the <em>Gothicum</em> and <em>Gallicum Missals</em>, and the Gallican adaptations of the Hieronymian Martyrology are the chief authorities on this point, and to these may be added some information to be gathered from the regulations of the Councils of <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Agde</a> (506), Orl&eacute;ans (541), Tour (567), and M&acirc;con (581), and from the "Historia Francorum" of <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a>, as to the Gallican practice in the sixth century. It is probable that there were many variations in different times and places, and that the influence of the Hieronymian Martyrology brought about many gradual assimilations to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The year, as is usual, began with <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a>. The Council of <a href="../cathen/09507a.htm">M&acirc;con</a>, which arranges for three days' fast a week, during that season, mentions St. Martin's Day as the key-day for <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> Sunday, so that, as a present in the Mozarabic and Ambrosian Rites, there were six <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> of <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> (but only two <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> Masses survive in the Gallicanum.) The Gothicum and the Luxeuil Lectionary both begin with <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Eve</a>. Then following <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>; St. Stephen; St. John (according to Luxeuil); St. James and St. John (according to the Gothicum, which agrees with the Hieronymian Martyrology and with a Syriac <a href="../cathen/10191b.htm">Menology</a> of 412, quoted by Duchesne. The Mozarabic has for 29 December "Sanctus Jacobus Frater Domini", but that is the other St. James); <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">Holy Innocents</a>; Circumcision; <a href="../cathen/06413f.htm">St. Genevieve</a> (Luxeuil Lectionary only. Her day is 3 Jan.); Sunday after the Circumcision (Luxeuil); Vigil of Epiphany; Epiphany; two <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> after Epiphany (Luxeuil); "Festum Sanctae Mariae" (Luxeuil, called "Assumptio" in the Gothicum, 18 Jan.); St. Agnes (Gothicum); after which follow in the Gothicum, out of their proper places, Sts. Cecily (22 Nov.); Clement (23 Nov.); Saturninus (29 Nov.); Andrew (30 Nov.); and Eulalia (10 Dec.); the Conversion of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (Gothicum); St. Peter's Chair (in both. This from its position after the Conversion of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> in the Gothicum, ought to be St. Peter's Chair at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, 22 Feb.; but it will not work out as such with the two <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> between it and the Epiphany and three between it and <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, as it appears in the Luxeuil Lectionary; so it must mean St. Peter's Chair at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 18 Jan., which is known to have been the festival kept in Gaul; three <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> after St. Peter's Chair (Luxeuil); <em>Initium Quadragesimae</em>; five <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> Masses (Gothicum); <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a> (Luxeuil); "Symboli Traditio" (Gothicum); Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a>, called by the name still used in the Ambrosian Rite, <em>Authentica Hebdomada</em> (Luxeuil); <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a>; <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>; <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Easter Eve</a>; <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Day</a> and the whole week; <a href="../cathen/09400a.htm">Low Sunday</a>, called in both <em>Clausum Paschae</em>; four more <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> after <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> (Luxeuil); Invention of the Cross (Gothicum, 3 May); <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a> (Gothicum, 6 May); three Rogation Days; <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">Ascension</a>; Sunday after <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">Ascension</a> (Luxeuil); Pentecost; Sunday after Pentecost (Luxeuil); Sts. Ferreolus and Ferru (Gothicum, 16 June); Nativity of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>; Sts. Peter and Paul; Decollation of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>; Missa de Novo fructus (sic, Luxeuil); <a href="../cathen/14031c.htm">St. Sixtus</a> (Gothicum, 6 Aug.); <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> (Gothicum, 10 Aug.); <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">St. Hippolytus</a> (Gothicum 13 Aug.); Sts. <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a> and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> (Gothicum, 16 Sept.); Sts. John and Paul (Gothicum, 26 June); St. Symphorian (Gothicum, 22 Aug.); <a href="../cathen/10068c.htm">St. Maurice</a> and his companions (Gothicum, 22 Sept.); St. Leger (Gothicum, 2 Oct.); St. Martin (Gothicum, 22 Nov.). Both books also have Commons of Martyrs and Confessors, the Luxeuil has Commons of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> for a number of other Masses, and the Gothicum has six Sunday Masses. The Gallicanum has a Mass in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06472b.htm">St. Germanus of Auxerre</a> before the two <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> Masses. In both the Gothicum and Gallicanum a large space is given to the services of the two days before <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, and in the latter the <em>Expositio</em> and <em>Traditio Symboli</em> are given at great length. The moveable feasts depended, of course, on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> altered the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> cycle from the old computation on a basis of 84 years to the new cycle of 532 of Victorius Aquitaine in 457, the Gallican Church, unlike the Celts, did the same; but when, in 525, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> adopted the 19 years cycle of <a href="../cathen/05010b.htm">Dionysius Exiguus</a>, the Gallican Church continued to use the cycle of Victorius, until the end of the eighth or beginning of the ninth century. <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> began with the first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a>, not with <a href="../cathen/01775b.htm">Ash Wednesday</a>. There is a not very intelligible passage in the canons of the Council of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> (567) to the effect that all through August there were "festivitates et missae sanctorum", but this is not borne out by the existing Sacramentaries of the Lectionary.
<h2 id="section4">The divine office</h2>

<p>There is curiously little information on this point, and it is not possible to reconstruct the Gallican <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> from the scanty allusions that exist. It seems probable that there was considerable diversity in various times and places, through councils, both in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, tried to bring about some uniformity. The principle authorities are the Councils of <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Agde</a> (506) and Tours (567), and allusions in the writings of <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a> and <a href="../cathen/03135b.htm">St. Caesarius of Arles</a>. These and other details have been gathered together by <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> in his "De Liturgi&acirc; Gallican&acirc;", and his essay on the Gallican <em>Cursus</em> is not yet superseded. The general arrangement and nomenclature were very similar to those of the Celtic Rite. There were two principal services, <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a> (<em>Ad Matutinam, Matutinum</em>) and <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> (<em>ad Duodecimam, ad Vesperas Lucernarium</em>); and four Lesser Hours, Prime, or Ad Secundum, <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">Terce</a>, Sext, and None; and probably two night services, <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Complin</a>, or <em>ad initium noctis</em>, and <a href="../cathen/11087b.htm">Nocturns</a>. But the application of these names is sometimes obscure. It is not quite clear whether <a href="../cathen/11087b.htm">Nocturns</a> and <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a> were not joined together as <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a>; Caesarius speaks of <em>Prima</em>, while the Gallicanum speaks of <em>Ad secundum</em>; Caesarius distinguishes between <em>Lucernarium</em> and <em>Ad Duodeciman</em>, while Aurelian distinguishes between <em>Ad Duodeciman</em> and <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Complin</a>; the Gothicum speaks of <em>Vespera Paschae</em> and <em>Initium Noctis Paschae</em>, and the Gallicanum has <em>Ad Duodeciman Paschae</em>. The distribution of the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> is not known. The Council of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> orders six psalms at Sext and twelve <em>Ad Duodecimam</em>, with <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a> (presumably as Antiphon) For <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a> there is a curious arrangement which reminds one of that in the Rule of St. Columbanus (see <a href="../cathen/03493a.htm">CELTIC RITE</a>, III). Normally in summer (apparently from <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> to July) "sex antiphonae binis psalmis" are ordered. This evidently means twelve psalms, two under each antiphon. In August there seem to have been no psalms, because there were festivals and Masses of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. "Toto Augusto manicationes fiant, quia festivitates sunt et missae sanctorum". The meaning of <em>manicationes</em> and of the whole statement is obscure. In September there were fourteen psalms, two under each antiphon; in October twenty-four psalms, three to each antiphon; and from December to <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> thirty psalms, three to each antiphon. Caesarius orders six psalms at Prime with the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> "Fulgentis auctor aetheris", two lessons, one from the old and one from the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, and a <em>capitellum</em>"; six psalms at <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">Terce</a>, Sext, and None, with an antiphon, a <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>, a lesson, and a capitellum; at <em>Lucernarium</em> a "Psalmus Directaneus", whatever that may be (cf. the "Psalmus Directus" of the Ambrosian Rite), two <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, a <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>, and a capitellum; and <em>ad Duodecimam</em>, eighteen psalms, an antiphon, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>, lesson, and capitellum. From this it seems as though <em>Lucernarium</em> and <em>Ad Duodecimam</em> made up <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>. combining the twelfth hour of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> (that is, of the recitation of the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> with its accompaniments) with a service for what, without any intention of levity, one may call "lighting-up time". The Ambrosian and Mozarabic <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> are constructed on this principle, and so is the Byzantine <em>Hesperinos</em>.

<p>Caesarius mentions a blessing given by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at the end of <em>Lucernarium</em>, "cumque expleto Lucernario benedictionem populo dedisset"; and the following is an order of the <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Council of Agde</a> (canon 30):"Et quia convenit ordinem ecclesiae ab omnibus aequaliter custodiri studendum est ut ubique fit et post antiphonas collectiones per ordinem ab episcopis vel presbyteris dicantur et hymni matutini vel vesperenti diebus omnibus decantentur et in conclusione matutinarum vel vespertinarum missarum post hymnos, capitella de psalmis dicantur et plebs collecta oratione ad vesperam ab Episcopo cum benedictione dimittatur". The rules of Caesarius and Aurelian both speak of two nocturns with lessons, which include on the feasts of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> lessons from their passions. They order also <em>Magnificat</em> to be sung at <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a>, and during the Paschal days; and on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and greater festivals <em>Gloria in Excelsis</em>. There is a short passage which throws a little light upon the Lyons use of the end of the fifth century in an account of the Council of Lyons in 499, quoted by <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a>. The council assembled by King Gundobad of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> began on the feast of St. Just. The vigil was kept at his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. This began with a lesson from the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> ("a Moyse") in which occurred the words "Sed ego indurabo cor ejus", etc. (<a href="../bible/exo007.htm#vrs3">Exodus 7:3</a>). Then psalms were sung and a lesson was read from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, in which occurred the words "Vade, et dices populo huic: Audite audientes", etc. (<a href="../bible/isa006.htm#vrs9">Isaiah 6:9</a>), the more psalms and a lesson from the Gospels containing the words "Vae tibi, Corozain!" etc. (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs21">Matthew 11:21</a>; or <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#vrs13">Luke 10:13</a>) and a lesson from the Epistles ("ex Apostolo") which contained the words "An divitias bonitatis ejus", etc. (<a href="../bible/rom002.htm#vrs4">Romans 2:4</a>). St. Agobard in the ninth century mentions that at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> there were no canticles except from the Psalms, no <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> written by poets, and no lessons except from Scripture. <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> says that though in his day Lyons agreed with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in many things, especially in the distribution of the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a>, and admitted lessons from the Acts of the Saints, there were still no <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> except at <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Complin</a>, and he mentions a similar rule as to <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> at Vienne. But canon 23 of the Council of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> (767) allowed the use of the <a href="../cathen/01392a.htm">Ambrosian hymns</a>. Though the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> of the second recension of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, now used in all the churches of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> except the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Vatican Basilica</a>, is known as the "Gallican", while the older, a revision of the "Vetus Itala" used now in St. Peter's at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> only, is known as the "Roman", it does not seem that the Gallican <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> was used even in Gaul until a comparatively later date, though it spread thence over nearly all the West. At present the Mozarabic and Ambrosian <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalters</a> are variants of the "Roman", with peculiarities of their own. Probably the decadence of the Gallican <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> was very gradual. In the eighth century tract in Cott. <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> Nero A. II. the "Cursus Gallorum" is distinguished from the "Cursus Romanorum", the "Cursus Scottorum" and the Ambrosian, all of which seem to have been going on then. The unknown writer, though his opinion is of no value on the origin of the "Cursus", may well have known about some of these of his own <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; but through the seventh century there are indications of a tendency to adopt the Roman or the Monastic "cursus" instead of the Gallican, or to mix them up, a tendency which was resisted at times by provincial councils.
<h2 id="section5">The mass</h2>

<p>The chief authorities for the Gallican Mass are the letters of <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (555-576); and by a comparison of these with the extant Sacramentaries, not only of Gaul but of the Celtic Rite, with the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> tracts on the Mass, with the books of the still existing Mozarabic Rite, and with the descriptions of the Spanish Mass given by St. Isidore, one may arrive at a fairly clear general <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the service, though there exists no Gallican Ordinary of the Mass and no Antiphoner. Mgr. Duchesne, in his "Origines du Cult chr&eacute;tien", has given a very full account constructed on this basis, though some will differ from him in his supplying certain details from Ambrosian books, and in his claiming the Bobbio Sacramentary as Ambrosian rather than Celtic.

<p>The Order of this Mass is as follows:--

<p>(1) The Entrance.-- Here an <em>Antiphona</em> (<a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a>) was sung. Nothing is said of any <em>Praeparatio Sacerdotis</em>, but there is one given in the Celtic Stowe <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> (see <a href="../cathen/03493a.htm">CELTIC RITE</a>); and the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> tracts describe a preliminary preparation of the Chalice, as does also the Mozarabic <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. As no Antiphoner exists, we have no specimen of a Gallican <em>Officium</em> or <a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a>. Duchesne gives a Mozarabic one, which has something of the form of a Roman Responsary. The Antiphona was followed by a proclamation of silence by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and the salutation <em>Dominus sit semper vobiscum</em> by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. This is still the Mozarabic form of <em>Dominus vobiscum</em>.

<p>(2) The Canticles.-- These, according to <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a>, were (i) The <em>Ajus</em> (<em>agios</em>) which may be the Greek Trisagion (<em>hagios Theos, k.t.l.</em>) or the Greek of the <em>Sanctus</em>, probably the latter which is still used elsewhere in the Mozarabic, and seems to be referred to in the <em>Ajus, ajus, ajus</em> of the life of <a href="../cathen/06537b.htm">St. G&eacute;ry</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> and the <em>Sanctus, sanctus, sanctus</em> of the Council of <a href="../cathen/16078b.htm">Vaison</a> (529). In the Bobbio there is a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> <em>Post Ajus</em>. (ii) The <em><a href="../cathen/08714a.htm">Kyrie Eleison</a></em>, sung by three boys. This has disappeared from the Mozarabic. It is mentioned by the Council of <a href="../cathen/16078b.htm">Vaison</a> (529). (iii) The Canticle of Zacharias (<em>Benedictus</em>). this is called <em>Prophetia</em> and there are collects <em>post Prophetiam</em> in the Riechenau fragments, the Gothicum and the Bobbio. The Mozarabic and Celtic books have <em>Gloria in Excelsis</em> here, but in the former the "Benedictus" is used instead on the Sunday before the Nativity of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>, called <em>Dominica pro adventu S. Johannis.</em> A different Canticle, <em>Sanctus Deus Angelorum</em> was used, according to <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a>, in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>.

<p>(3) The Lessons-- These were the <em>Lectio Prophetica</em> from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and the <em>Lectio Apostolica</em> or Epistle. In <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Paschal time</a> the Apocalypse took the place of the Lectio Prophetica, and a lesson from the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> that of the Epistle. In <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> the Histories of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> were read instead of the Prophetical Lesson, and on Saint's Days the Acts of the Saints. This agrees with the present Mozarabic, except in the Acts of the Saints, and with the Luxeuil Lectionary, and the Bobbio. The Acts of the Saints were used as Mass Lessons in the Ambrosian Rite as late as the twelfth century. According to <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> the second lesson followed immediately on the first, but in the Mozarabic the <em>Benedicite</em> and a <em>Psallendo</em> (Responsary) come between them. In the Gallican the <em>Benedicite</em> and the <em>Responsorium</em> followed the Epistle. The Bobbio has a fixed collect, <em>Post Benedictionem</em>, which is that which follows <em>Benedictus es</em> (<a href="../bible/dan003.htm">Daniel 3</a>) on Ember Saturdays in the Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>.

<p>(4) The Gospel-- This was preceded by a procession <em>in tribunal analogii</em>, i.e. to the <a href="../cathen/01381e.htm">ambo</a>. The word <em>Analogion</em> is still the Byzantine term for the desk from which the Gospel is read. A clerk again sang the <em>Ajus</em>, and seven lighted candles were carried. The clerks cried out <em>Gloria tibi, Domine.</em> <em>Sanctus</em> was sung as they returned. Nothing is said about <em>Alleluia</em> preceding the Gospel, nor is there any in the Mozarabic . The Celtic Rite as shown in the Stowe <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, included an <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a> at that point, as do most other rites.

<p>(5) Here, according to St. Germanus, followed the Homily.

<p>(6) The Prex.-- The passage of <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> is "Preces vero psallere levitas pro populo ab origine libri Moysaici ducit exordium, ut audita Apostoli praedicatione levitae pro populo deprecentur et sacerdotes prostrati ante Dominum pro peccatis populi intercedant". Duschene makes this refer to a Bidding Litany to follow the Homily, but judging from the analogy of the Stowe Mass, which places a <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> between the Epistle and Gospel, and of the Mozarabic, which on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> has a very similar <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> between the Prophetical Lesson and the Epistle, said by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who "prosternat se ad pedem altaris", it might be possible to understand "audita Apostoli praedicatione" to mean "after the Epistle". The Roman <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, however, which are similar in import to this <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a>, follow the Gospel; and so does the Great Synapte of Clementine, the Byzantine, and other Eastern rites which have petitions of the same type, and one of which is probably the original source of the Prex. The Council of Lyons (517) also mentions "orationem plebis quae <em>post evangelia</em> legeretur". No Gallican text of this <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> exists, but it was probably much of the same type as that of the Stowe, which is called "Deprecatio Sancti Martini, and that which takes the place of the "Gloria in Excelsis" in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> in the Ambrosian. The Prex is followed by a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> called <em>Post Precem</em>.

<p>(7) The Dismissal of the Catechumens.-- This is mentioned by <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> as an ancient rite of which the form was still observed. He says in almost the same words which <a href="../cathen/08277b.htm">James of Edessa</a>, speaking of the Syrian Rite, used a century later, that the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> proclaims "juxta antiquum Ecclesiae ritum". No mention is made by <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> of penitents, but the Council of Lyons just mentioned gave them permission to remain until after the Prex. In the Stowe Mass, as in the Roman, there is no allusion to <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> or penitents.

<p>(8) The Great Entrance and <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a>.-- It seems appropriate to give the Byzantine name to this <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, for, according to <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus's</a> description, it resembled the Great Entrance of that rite rather than anything which is now found in either the Roman or the Mozarabic of today, or in the Celtic Rite; and the Procession of the <em>Vecchioni</em> at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (see <a href="../cathen/01394a.htm">AMBROSIAN RITE</a>) is altogether a different matter. First came the closing of the doors. This took place immediately after the Dismissal of the Catechumens in the Liturgy of St. James, and is put at the same point in the description of <a href="../cathen/08277b.htm">James of Edessa</a>. In the Byzantine Rite of today it comes after the Great Entrance. In the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> there is no sign of it. <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> gives it a mystical meaning about the gates of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but <a href="../cathen/08277b.htm">James of Edessa</a> gives the real origin, the guarding of the mysteries against the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. Then the already prepared Elements were brought in, the bread in a vessel shaped like a tower, the mixed wine and water in a <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>. <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> speaks of them as <em>Corpus Domini</em> and <em>Sanguis Christi</em> (cf. The wording of the Byzantine <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> known as the Cherubicon). While this was done the choir sang what <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> called the <em>Sonus</em>. The Mozarabic <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> calls the Responsory that comes at this point the <em>Lauda</em>, and the name <em>Sonus</em> is given to very similar Responsories sung at <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> and <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a>. While the elements were being offered the choir sang the <em>Laudes</em>, which included <em>Alleluia</em>. This is the Mozarabic <em>Sacraficium</em>, the Roman <em>Offertorium</em>. St. Isidore gives the latter name to it. The tract in the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> "Leabhar Breac" speaks of elevating the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> "quando canitur <em>Imola Deo sacrificium laudis</em>", but the Stowe, being a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> book, is silent about any antiphon here, though the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> said by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> are given. In the Stowe <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a>, which is a good deal Romanized, is preceded by the Creed. In the Ambrosian, as in the Byzantine, the Creed follows the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a>. In the Gallican of <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> there was as yet no Creed. By the time of <a href="../cathen/08277b.htm">James of Edessa</a> it had got into the Syrian Liturgy, but the Roman did not adopt it until much later (see LITURGICAL USE OF THE CREED). <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> mentions three veils, the "palla linostima" [<em>linostema</em> is defined by St. Isidore (Orig., 19,22) as a material woven of flax and wool] "corporalis palla" of pure linen, "super quam oblatio ponitur", and a veil of silk adorned with gold and gems with which the oblation was covered. Probably the "linostima" covered the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, like the modern pall.

<p>(9) The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that follows is not mentioned by <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a>, but is given in the Gallican books. It is preceded by a Bidding Prayer. The titles of the two are <em>Praefatio Missae</em> and <em>Collectio</em> (the usual expression being "Collectio sequitur"). They vary with the day and are found in the Gothicum, Gallicanum, <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a>, and some of the <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> fragments. St. Isidore mentions them as the first two of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the Mass. In the Mozarabic the Bidding Prayer is called <em>Missa</em>, and is followed by "Agyos, agyos, agyos, Domine Deus Rex aeterne tibi laudes et gratias", sung by the choir, and an invariable invitation to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. The variable <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which follows is called <em>Alia Oratio</em>. The "Missa" is almost always a Bidding Prayer addressed to the people, while the "Alia Oratio" is nearly always addressed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but sometimes both are Bidding <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayers</a> and sometimes both are <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>(10) The Diptychs.-- <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> says "Nomina defunctorum ideo hor illa recitantur qua pallium tollitur". The Gallican books and the Bobbio have variable <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> <em>Post Nomina</em>, and the <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> fragments have also <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> <em>Ante Nomina</em>, which are sometimes Bidding <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayers</a> as are sometimes the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> <em>Post Nomina</em> in the Gothicum. The form of the Intercession is given in the Stowe, but moved to its Roman positions in the Gelasian Canon. The Mozarabic retains the old position and has a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> <em>Post Nomina</em>, which St. Isidore calls the third <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. The position of the Great Intercession at this point exactly is peculiar to the Hispano-Gallican Rite, but it comes very near to the Alexandrian position, which is in the middle of the Preface, where a rather awkward break is made for it. The West Syrian and Byzantine Liturgies place the Great Intercession after the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a>, the East Syrian before the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a>, and the Roman and Ambrosian divide it in two, placing the Intercession for the Living before, and that for the Dead after the Consecration, with Commemorations of Saints with each.

<p>(11) The Pax.-- <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> mentions that the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">Kiss</a> of Peace came next, as it does now in the Mozarabic. St. Isidore associates it with the fourth <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, which in the Gallican and Mozarabic books is called <em>Ad Pacem</em>. The <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, which has completely obliterated all distinction between the <em>Missa Catachumenorum</em> and the <em>Missa Fidelium</em>, associates this sign of unity, not with the beginning of the latter, but with the Communion, and this position is as old as the letter of St. Innocent I (416) to Decentius of Giubbio. The Ambrosian now follows the Roman, as did the Celtic Rite when the Stowe <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> was written, but the Bobbio retained the collect <em>Ad Pacem</em> in its original place, though it was probably not used with the Gelasian canon.

<p>(12) The <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a>-- <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> merely mentions the <em>Sursum Corda</em>, and says nothing about what follows it. The dialogue was probably in the usual form, though the curious variation in the Mozarabic Rite makes that somewhat uncertain. Then follows the <em>Contestatio</em> or <em>Immolatio</em>, called by the Mozarabic Books <em>Illatio</em>, which is in the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> the Praefatio. St. Isidore calls it the fifth <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and uses the word <em>Illatio</em> for it. The Gallican books, the Bobbio, and the Mozarabic <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> give a variable one for every Mass, and the Gallican books often give two. The general form is the same as the Roman, perhaps more diffuse in its expressions. Usually the words <em>Per quem</em> alone at the end of the proper section indicate the conclusion. The Mozarabic Illations end in varying ways, always of course leading up to the Sanctus.

<p>(13) The Sanctus.-- The Gallican wording is not found, but there is no reason to suspect any variations unless the <a href="../cathen/10611a.htm">Mozarabic</a> "gloria majestatis tuae" was also Gallican.

<p>(14) The Post-Sanctus.-- This takes up the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the Sanctus and amplifies it, leading on to the Recital of the Institution. It generally, but not always, begins with "Vere Sanctus, vere Benedictus". There is a variable Post-Sanctus for every Mass. In the Gallican books this passage ends with some expression, generally simply "per Christum Dominum nostrum", which serves as the antecedent to "Qui pridie"; but, owing to the interpolated <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>" Adesto, adesto Jesu", etc., the Recital of the Institution begins with a fresh sentence with no relative. All Liturgies except the Roman have some form of Post-Sanctus. Even the Ambrosian has one for <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Easter Eve</a>, and the Celtic Stowe <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> seems to use one with or without the <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">Roman Canon</a>. The Bobbio, completely Romanized from the Preface onwards, does not include one among its variables. In one Mass in the Gothicum (<a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Easter Eve</a>) the Post-Sanctus (so called by Neale and Forbes) contains a quite definite <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which follows is called <em>ad fractionem panis</em>, so it may be really a Post-Pridie.

<p>(15) The Recital of the Institution.-- "Qui pridie quam pro nostra omnium salute pateretur" is all that exists of the Gallican form, as catchwords, so to speak. This, except that "et" comes there before "omnium", is the Ambrosian. The Stowe and the Bobbio have the Roman "Qui pridie quam pateretur", etc., but the corrector of the Stowe has added the Ambrosian ending "passionem meam praedicabitis", etc. The Mozarabic, though Post-Pridie is the name of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which follows, has (after an invocatory <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to our Lord) "D.N.J. C. in qua nocte tradebatur", etc., following <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> words in <a href="../bible/1co011.htm">1 Corinthians 11</a>, in which it agrees with the principal Eastern Liturgies. This is probably a late alteration.

<p>(16) The Post-Pridie, called also <em>Post Mysterium</em> and <em>Post Secreta</em>, these two being the more usual Gallican names, while <em>Post-Pridie</em> is the universal Mozarabic name. This is a variable <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, usually addressed to Christ or to the Father, but occasionally in the Mozarabic in the form of a Bidding Prayer. The petitions often include something of an oblation, like the <em>Unde et memores</em>, and often a more or less definite <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a>. Of the eleven Masses in the <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> fragment four contain a definite <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> in this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, one has a Post-Pridie with no <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a>, one is unfinished, but has no <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> as far as it goes, and in the rest this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is wanting. In the Gothicum there is generally no <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a>, but nine of the Masses there have one of some sort, in some cases vague. In the Mozarabic this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is usually only the oblation, though rarely there is an <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a>. It is followed there by a fixed <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> resembling the clause <em>Per quem haec omnia</em> in the <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">Roman Canon</a>.

<p>(17) The Fraction.-- Of this <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> says only that it takes place, and an antiphon is sung during it. The only rite which now retains this antiphon always is the Ambrosian, where it is called <em>Confractorium</em>. The Mozarabic has substituted for it the recitation of the Creed, "praeter in locis in quibus erit antiphona propria ad confractionem panis", which is chiefly during <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, and in votive Masses. In the Stowe there is a long <a href="../cathen/12787a.htm">responsory</a>, apparently not variable. No Gallican Confratorium remains. The fraction is not described, but in the Celtic Rite there was a very complicated fraction, and in the Mozarabic the Sacred Host is divided into nine particles, seven of which are arranged in the form of a cross. The Council of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> (567) directs that the particles shall be arranged "non in imaginario ordine sed sub crucis titulo", so that it is probable that the Gallican fraction was similarly elaborate. The Stowe Gaelic tract speaks of two fractions, the first into two halves with a re-uniting and a commixture, the second into a number of particles varying with the rank of the day. The "Leabhar Breac" tract only mentions the first. Dom L. Gougaud (Les rites de la Consecration et de la Fraction dans la Liturgie Celtique", in "Report of the 19th Eucharistic Congress" (p. 359) conjectures that the first was the Host of the celebrant, the second that for the communicants.

<p>(18) The <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Pater Noster</a>.-- This was preceded by a variable introduction after the plan of <em>Praeceptis salutaribus moniti</em> and was followed by a variable Embolism. These are entitled in the Gallican books <em>Ante Orationem Dominicam</em> and <em>Post Orationem Dominicam</em>. In the Mozarabic the introduction <em>Ad orationem Dominicam</em> is variable, the Embolism is not.

<p>(19) The Commixture.-- Of the manner of this in the Gallican Rite there is no information, nor is there any record of the words used. But see <a href="../cathen/03493a.htm">CELTIC RITE</a>. In the Mozarabic the particle <em>Regnum</em> (see <a href="../cathen/10611a.htm">MOZARABIC RITE</a>) is dipped in the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> with the words "Vicit Leo de tribu Juda, radix David, Alleluia. Qui sedes super Cherubim, radix David, Alleluia", and the particle is dropped into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> saying "Sancta sanctis; et conjunctio corporis D.N.J.C. sit sumentibus et potantibus nobis ad veniam et defunctis fidelibus praestetur ad requiem."

<p>(20) The Benediction.-- This when pronounced by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was a variable formula, sometimes of considerable length. <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> gives a form which was said by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> "Pax, fides et caritas et communicatio corporis et sanguinis Domini sit semper vobiscum." There is a very similar form in the Stowe <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> and in the Ambrosian, but in both these it is connected with the Pax which comes at this point, as in the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>. In the Mozarabic, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> proclaims "Humilitate vos benedictioni". This is alluded to by <a href="../cathen/03135b.htm">St. Caesarius of Arles</a> and is very like <em>tas kephalas hemon to kyrio klinomen</em> in the Byzantine Rite. Then follows a long variable Benediction of four clauses, pronounced by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the people responding "Amen" to each clause. The Gallican Benedictions were of the same type. The practice of a Benediction before Communion continued in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> long after the extinction of the Gallican Rite and survives to this day at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. It was also the practice of the Anglo-Saxon Church. Dom Cabrol ("Benediction Episcopale" in "Report of the 19th Eucharistic Congress") considers that the Anglo-Saxon Benedictions were not survivals of Gallican (Celtic) usage, but were derived from the ancient practice of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself, and that the rite was a general one of which traces are found nearly everywhere.

<p>(21) The Communion.-- <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> gives no details of this, but mentions the singing of the <em>Trecanum</em>. His description of this was not very clear. "Sic enim prima in secunda, secunda in tertia, et rursum tertia in secunda rotatur in prima." But he takes the threefold chant as an emblem of the Trinity. The Mozarabic on most days has a fixed anthem, <a href="../bible/psa033.htm#vrs8">Psalm 33:8</a> (Gustate, et videte) 1 (2) (Benedicam Dominum) and 22 (23) (Redimet Dominus), and the Gloria with three <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluias</a> after each verse. This is called <em>Ad Accedentes</em>. In <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> and <a href="../cathen/11516a.htm">Easter-tide</a> there are variants. The rather obvious <em>Gustate et videte</em> is given also in the Stowe <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> and Bangor Antiphoner, and is mentioned by <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a>. It occurs in certain Eastern Liturgies. In the Mozarabic it is followed by the <em>Communio</em> "Refecti Christi corpore et sangunie, te laudamus, Domine, Alleluia" (thrice), with a variant in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>. This is found also in the Celtic books. Probably it was used by the Gallican also. In the Mozarabic the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> Communion, with his <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">private devotions</a>, goes on during these anthems. <a href="../cathen/03135b.htm">St. Caesarius of Arles</a> and the Council of Auxerre (about 578), quoted by Duchesne, allude to the fact that men received the Host in the bare hand, but that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> covered the hand with a linen cloth called <em>dominicalis</em>, which each brought with her.

<p>(22) The Post-Communion.-- This, as given in the Gallican books, is a variable <em>Praefatio</em>, or Bidding Prayer, followed by a collect. The former is entitled <em>Post Communionem</em>, the latter <em>Collectio</em>. The Mozarabic has only a collect which is variable, but with a smaller selection than the other <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.

<p>(23) The Dismissal formula of the Gallican Mass is not extant. It may have been like the Stowe "Missa acta est in pace", or one form of Mozarabic "Missa acta est in nomine D.B.J.C., proficiamus cum pace."

<p>It will be seen from the above analysis that the Gallican Mass contained a very small number of fixed elements, so that nearly the whole service was variable according to the day. The absence of an Ordinary is, therefore, of less importance than it would be in, for instance, the Roman or the Ambrosian. The full list of variables, as shown from the <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> fragments, the Gothicum, and <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus's</a> description, is:--

<p>(1) The <a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a>. (2) (<em>Collectio</em>) <em>post Prophetiam</em>. (3) <em>Lectio Prophetica</em>. (4) <em>Lectio Apostolica</em>. (5) <em>Responsorium</em> before the Gospel. (6) Gospel. (7) <em>Post Precem</em>. (8) <em>Sonum</em>. (9) <em>Laudes</em>. (10) <em>Praefatio Missae</em>. (11) <em>Collectio</em>. (12) <em>Ante Nomina</em>. (13) <em>Post Nomina</em>. (14) <em>Ad Pacem</em>. (15) <em>Contestatio</em> or <em>Immolatio</em>. (16) <em>Post Sanctus</em>. (17) <em>Post Pridie</em>. (18) <em>Confractorium</em>? (19) <em>Ante Orationem Dominicam</em>. (20) <em>Post Orationem Dominicam</em>. (22) <em>Trecanum</em>? (23) <em>Communio</em>? (24) <em>Post Communionem</em>. (25) <em>Collectio</em> or <em>Consummatio Missae</em>. Of these nos. 2. 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25 belong to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> part, and are therefore found in the Sacramentaries; 1, 5, 8, 9, as well as 18, 22, and 23, if these last were variable, belong to the part of the choir, and would be found in the Antiphoners, if any such existed; and 3, 4, 6, are found in the Lectionary. No. 12 is only found among the <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> fragments, but it is found there in every Mass of which the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> is not imperfect at that part of the service. Thus the fixed parts of the service would only be: (a) The three Canticles. (b) The <em>Ajus</em> and Sanctus, etc., at the Gospel. (c) The <em>Prex</em>. (d) The Dismissal. (e) The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> at the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a>. (f) The Great Intercession. (g) The <em>Pax</em> formula. (h) The <em>Sursum Corda</em> dialogue. (i) The Sanctus. (j) The Recital of the Institution. (k) The <em>Pater Noster</em>, and possibly the <em>Confractorium, Trecanum</em> and <em>Communio</em>, with probably the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> devotions at Communion. Most of these are very short and the only really important passage wanting is the one fixed passage in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> of Consecration, the Recital of the Institution.
<h2 id="section6">The occasional services</h2>

<p>A. <em>The Baptismal Service</em>.-- The authorities for the Gallican Baptismal Service are the Gothicum and Gallicanum, both of which are incomplete, and a few details in the second Letter of <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The forms given in the Stowe and the Bobbio are to much Romanized to illustrate the Gallican Rite very much. The form given in the Gothicum is the least complete. It consists of:--

<p>(1) <em>"Ad Christianum faciendum."</em> A Bidding Prayer and collect, with the form of <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">signing</a> on eyes, ears, and nostrils.

<p>(2) The Blessing of the Font. A Bidding Prayer, a collect, a <em>Contestio</em> (Preface), the infusion of <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a> in the form of a cross with a triple insufflation, and an <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcism</a>, which here is in an unusual place.

<p>(3) The Baptismal formula "Baptizo te in nomine ... in remissionem peccatorum, ut habeas vitam aeternam".

<p>(4) The Chrismation. The formula "Perungo te chrisma sanctitatis" seems to have been mixed up with a form for the bestowal of the white garment, for it goes on "tunicam immortalitatis, quam D.N.J.C. traditam a Patre primus accepit ut eam integram et inlibatam preferas ante tribunal Christi et vivas insaecula saeculorum". Probably the ommission is "... in Nomine", etc., in the one formula; and "Accipe vestem candidam", or possibly "Accipe" alone, in the other. Mgr. Duchesne's suggestion of "a special symbolism, according to which the <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a> would be considered as a garment" does not commend itself, for want of a verb to govern "tunicam". Still there is another formula for the white garment farther on.

<p>(5) The Feet Washing. The form here is similar to that in the Gallicanum, the Bobbio, and the Stowe: "Ego te lavo pedes. Sicut D.N.J.C. fecit discipulis suis, tu facias hospitibus et peregrenis ut habeas vitam aeternam". This <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> is only found in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. At the Council of Elvira in 305 an order was made that it should be performed by clerks and not by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. This limitation, of which the wording is quite clear, has been unaccountably interpreted to mean that it was then forbidden altogether.

<p>(6) The Vesting with the white garment. This has a form similar to the Roman and Celtic, but not quite the same.

<p>(7) Two final Bidding <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayers</a> with no collect.

<p>The Gallicanum has a much fuller form with the <em>Traditio</em> and <em>Expositio Symboli</em>, etc. It is:--

<p>(1) "Ad faciendum Catechumenum." A long and curious <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcism</a> beginning "Adgredior te, immundissime, damnate spiritus". This is only a fragment, and probably the unction and salt came here, as in the Spanish Rite.

<p>(2) "Expositio vel Traditio Symboli." An address, the Creed, a long exposition of it, and a collect. The Creed varies verbally from the Roman form. There is a second "Expositio" later on.

<p>(3) "Expositio Evangeliorum in aurium apertione ad electos." An address followed by a few words of each of the Gospels and an exposition of the emblems of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>. This is found in the Gelasian Sacramentary.

<p>(4) "Praemissiones ad Scrutamen." A Bidding <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> and a collect.

<p>(5) "Praefatio Orationis Dominicae". The tradition and exposition of the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>.

<p>(6) "Missa in symboli traditione." This is imperfect but agrees nearly, as far as they both go, with a Mass of the same title in the Gothicum.

<p>(7) "Expositio Symboli." This, though as on the same lines as the earlier one, differs in wording. It is very incomplete and has probably got into this place by mistake.

<p>(8) "Opus ad Baptizando (sic)." This is preceded by various services for <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a>, <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Easter Eve</a>, including the Blessing of the Candle. It begins with a "Praefatio antequam exorcidietur" and a collect. Then follow the <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcism</a> and the blessing of thee font, and the infusion of the <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, this time in the form of three crosses.

<p>(9) The Interrogation. This includes the renunciation of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> and a confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The latter has a peculiar form, evidently directed against <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>:--

<blockquote><p>"Credis Patrem et Filium et Spiritum Sanctum unius esse virtutis? R. Credo. <br>Credis Patrem et Filium et Spiritum Sanctum ejusdem esse potestatis? R. Credo. <br>Credis Patrem et Filium et Spiritum Sanctum trinae veritatis una manente substantia Deum esse perfectum? R. Credo.</p></blockquote>

<p>(10) The Baptismal formula: "Baptizo te credentem in Nomine, etc., ut habeas vitam in saecula saeculorum."

<p>(11) The Chrismation. The formula is the same as the modern Roman.

<p>(12) The Feet-washing. The words are slightly different from those in the Gothicum, <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a>, and Stowe, but to the same effect.

<p>(13) The "Post Baptismum". A single <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> (without a Bidding Prayer) beginning "Deus ad quem scubias veteris hominis in fonte depositas". It will be seen that there is no giving of the white robe in the Gallicum, and that the signing of the hand, found in the Celtic Rite, is absent from both it and the Gothicum.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a> ceremonies which are mixed with the Baptismal service in the two books are not very characteristic. The couplets of invitatory and collect which occur in the Roman <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> service are given with verbal variations in the Gothicum; in both, however, there are other <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of a similar type and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for some of the Hours of <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> and <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Easter Eve</a>. The Blessing of the <a href="../cathen/11515b.htm">Paschal Candle</a> consists of a Bidding Prayer and collect (in the Gothicum only), the "Exulter" and its Preface nearly exactly as in the Roman, a "Collectio post benedictionem cerei", and "Collectio post hymnum cerei." There is no <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of the New Fire in either.

<p>B. The Ordination services of the Gallican Rite do not occur in any of the avowedly Gallican books, but they are found in the Gelasian Sacramentary and thee Missale Francorum, that is to say, a mixed form which does not agree with the more or less contemporary Roman form in the Leonine and Gregorian Sacramentaries, though it contains some Roman <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, is found in these two books, and it may be reasonably be inferred that the differences are of Gallican origin. Moreover, extracts relating to ceremonial are given with them from the <em>Statuta Ecclesia Antiqua</em>, formerly attributed the Fourth <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a>, but now known to be a Gallican <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> "<a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in the province of Arles towards the end of the fifth century" (Duschene). The ceremonial therein contained agrees with that described in "De Officiis Ecclesiasticis" by <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">St. Isidore of Seville</a>. The forms of <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, including <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, were very short, and consisted simply of the delivery of the instruments: keys to the porters, books of <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcists</a>, <a href="../cathen/04543a.htm">cruets</a> to <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a>, <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a>, <a href="../cathen/02334a.htm">basin</a>, ewer and towel to <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, occur, Bidding <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayers</a> and all, in the Roman Pontifical of today. In the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> there is a form which is found in the Byzantine Rite, but has not been adopted in the Roman, the recognition by the people, after an address, with the cry of "Dignus est!". This is used for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> also (cf. <em>Axios</em>, in the Byzantine ordinations). The Bidding Prayer and collect which follow are both in the present Roman Pontifical, though separated by much additional matter. The <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> was of the same type as that of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, with the addition of the anointing of the hands. The address, with a varied end, and the collect (but not the Bidding Prayer), and the anointing of the hands with its formula are in the modern Roman Pontifical, but with very large additions. The <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> began, after an election, with a presentation and recognition, neither of which is in the modern Pontifical. Then followed a long Bidding Prayer, also not adopted in the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, and the Consecration <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> <em>Deus omnium honorum</em>, part of which is embodied in the Preface in the Leonine and Gregorian Sacramentaries, and in the present Pontifical. During this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> held the Book of the Gospels over the candidate, and all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> laid their hands on his head. Then followed the anointing of the hands, but apparently not of the head as in the modern rite, with a formula which is not in the Roman books.

<p>C. The Consecration of a Church does not occur in the recognized Gallican books and from <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in the Gelasian Sacramentary and Missale Francorum. It would seem, as Mgr. Duschene shows in his excellent analysis of both rites (Origines du culte chr&eacute;tien), that at a time when the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> of Consecration was exclusively funerary and contained little else but the deposition of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, as shown in the <em>Ordines</em> in the St. Amand <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> (Bibl. Nat. Lat. 974), the Gallican Rite resembled more closely that of the modern Pontifical, which may be presumed to have borrowed from it. The commentary of <a href="../cathen/12764a.htm">Remigius of Auxerre</a> (late ninth century), published by Mart&eacute;ne, and the Sacramentary of <a href="../cathen/01513b.htm">Angoul&ecirc;me</a> (Bibl. Nat. Lat. 12048) are the other authorities from which Duchesne derives his details. The order of the Celtic Consecration given in the Leabhar Breac is very similar (see <a href="../cathen/03493a.htm">CELTIC RITE</a>). The order is:

<p>(1) The Entrance of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, with "Tollite portas, principes, vestras", etc., which exhibits the outline of the present rite. (2) The Alphabets, as at present. (3) The <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">Exorcism</a>, Blessing and mixing of water, salt, ashes, and wine. (4) The Lustration of the Altar and the inside of thee Church. (5) The Consecration <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayers</a>. These are the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> "Deus, qui loca nomini tuo", and "Deus sanctificationum, omnipotens dominator", which occur at the same point at present. The latter <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in the Gallican Rite is worked into a Preface (in the Roman sense of the word). (6) The Anointing of the Altar with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, with the five crosses as at present. the Celtic Rite had seven. (7) The anointing of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>. Nothing is said about crosses on the walls. (8) The Consecration of the Altar with the burning of a cross of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> thereon, and a Bidding Prayer and collect. (9) The Blessing of linen, vessels, etc. (10) The Translation of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">Relics</a> which have been kept in a separate place and a night watch kept over them. This service, which is clearly the modern elaborate <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> in germ, has also many points in common with the <em>Akolouthia eis Egkainia Naou</em> in the Byzantine Euchologion, which is still simpler. The three are evidently three stages of the same service.
