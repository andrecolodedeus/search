<h1>The Holy Lance</h1>  

<p>We read in the <a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs34">Gospel of St. John (19:34)</a>, that, after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour's</a> death, "one of the soldiers with a spear [<em>lancea</em>] opened his side and immediately there came out blood and water". Of the weapon thus sanctified nothing is known until the pilgrim <a href="../cathen/01585b.htm">St. Antoninus</a> of Piancenza (A.D. 570), describing the holy places of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, tells us that he saw in the basilica of Mount Sion "the crown of thorns with which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> and the lance with which He was struck in the side". The mention of the lance at the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of the Holy Sepulchre in the so-called "Breviarus", as M. de Mely points out (Exuviae, III, 32), is not to be relied on. On the other hand, in a miniature of the famous Syriac <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the Laurentian Library at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, illuminated by one Rabulas in the year 586, the incident of the opening of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> side is given a prominence which is highly significant. Moreover, the name Longinus &#151; if, indeed, this is not a later addition &#151; is written in Greek characters (<em>LOGINOS</em>) above the head of the soldier who is thrusting his lance into <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour's</a> side. This seems to show that the legend which assigns this name to the soldier (who, according to the same tradition, was healed of ophthalmia and converted by a drop of the precious blood spurting from the wound) is as old as the sixth century. And further it is tempting, even if rash, to conjecture that the name <em>Logginos</em>, or <em>Logchinos</em> is in some way connected with the lance (<em>logche</em>). Be this as it may, a spear believed to be identical with that which pierced <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour's</a> body was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> at the close of the sixth century, and the presence there of this important <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> is attested half a century earlier by <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> (In Ps. lxxxvi, P.L., LXX, 621) and after him by <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> (P.L., LXXI, 712). In 615 <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was captured by a lieutenant of the Persian King Chosroes. The <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">sacred relics</a> of the Passion fell into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, and, according to the "Chronicon Paschale", the point of the lance, which had been broken off, was given in the same year to Nicetas, who took it to Constantinople and deposited it in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Sophia. This point of the lance, which was now set in an "yeona", or icon, many centuries afterwards (i.e., in 1244) was present by Baldwin to St. Louis, and it was enshrined with the Crown of Thorns in the Sainte Chapelle. During the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> these <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were removed to the Bibliotheque Nationale, and, although the Crown has been happily preserved to us, the other has now disappeared.

<p>As for the second and larger portion of the lance, Arculpus, about 670, saw it at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, where it must have been restored by Heraclius, but it was then <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of the Holy Sepulchre. After this date we practically hear no more of it from <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> to the Holy Land. In particular, St. Willibald, who came to Jerusalem in 715, does not mention it. There is consequently some reason to believe that the larger <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> as well as the point had been conveyed to Constantinople before the tenth century, possibly at the same time as the Crown of Thorns. At any rate its presence at Constantinople seems to be clearly attested by various <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, particularly Russians, and, though it was deposited in various churches in succession, it seems possible to trace it and distinguish it from the companion <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the point. <a href="../cathen/09587b.htm">Sir John Mandeville</a>, whose credit as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> has of late years been in part rehabilitated, declared, in 1357, that he had seen the blade of the Holy Lance both at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and at Constantinople, and that the latter was a much larger <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> than the former. Whatever the Constantinople <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> was, it fell into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, and in 1492, under circumstances minutely described in Pastor's "History of the Popes", the Sultan Bajazet sent it to <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a> to conciliate his favour towards the sultan's brother Zizim, who was then the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>. This <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> has never since left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where it is preserved under the <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a> of <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (De Beat. et Canon., IV, ii, 31) states that he obtained from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> an exact drawing of the point of the lance, and that in comparing it with the larger <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> in St. Peter's he was satisfied that the two had originally formed one blade. M. M&eacute;ly published for the first time in 1904, an accurate design of the Roman <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the lance head, and the fact that it has lost its point is as conspicuous as in other, often quite fantastic, delineations of the Vatican lance. At the time of the sending of the lance to <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a>, great <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> as to its authenticity were felt at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, as Burchard's "Diary" (I, 473-486, ed. Thusasne) plainly shows, on account of the rival lances known to be preserved at <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, Paris, etc., and on account of the supposed discovery of the Holy Lance at Antioch by the revelation of St. Andrew, in 1098, during the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section1">First Crusade</a>. <a href="../cathen/12672b.htm">Raynaldi</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>, and many other authorities believed that the lance found in 1098 afterwards fell into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and was that sent by Bajazet to <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Pope Innocent</a>, but from M. de Mely's investigations it seems probable that it is identical with the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> now jealously preserved at Etschmiadzin in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. This was never in any proper sense a lance, but rather the head of a standard, and it may conceivably (before its discovery under very questionable circumstances by the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusader</a> Peter Bartholomew) have been <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as the weapon with which certain <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> at <a href="../cathen/02392a.htm">Beirut</a> struck a figure of Christ on the Cross; an outrage which was believed to have been followed by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> discharge of blood.

<p>Another lance claiming to be that which produced the wound in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> side is now preserved among the imperial insignia at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and is known as the lance of <a href="../cathen/10068c.htm">St. Maurice</a>. This weapon was used as early as 1273 in the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of the Emperor of the West, and from an earlier date as an emblem of investiture. It came to <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> in 1424, and it is also probably the lance, known as that of the <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a>, which enshrined a nail or some portion of a nail of the Crucifixion. The story told by <a href="../cathen/15633d.htm">William of Malmesbury</a> of the giving of the Holy Lance to King Athelstan of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> by <a href="../cathen/07515c.htm">Hugh Capet</a> seems to be due to a misconception. One other remaining lance reputed to be that concerned in the Passion of Christ is preserved at <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, but, though it is alleged to have been there for eight centuries, it is impossible to trace its earlier history.
