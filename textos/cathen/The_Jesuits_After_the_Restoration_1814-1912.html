<h1>The Jesuits After the Restoration (1814-1912)</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> had resolved to restore the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> during his captivity in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; and after his return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he did so with little delay; 7 August, 1814, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Solicitudo omnium ecclesiarum," and therewith, the general in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, Thaddeus Brzozowski, acquired universal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. After the permission to continue given by <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, the first Russian congregation had elected as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> Stanislaus Czerniewicz (17 Oct., 1782-7 July 1785), who was succeeded by Gabriel Lenkiewicz (27 Sept., 1785-10 Nov., 1798) and Francis Kareu (1 Feb., 1799-20 July, 1902). On the receipt of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Catholicae Fidei", of 7 March, 1801, his title was changed from <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to general. Gabriel Gruber succeeded (10 Oct., 1802-26 March 1805) and was followed by Thaddeus Brzozowski (2 Sept., 1805). Almost simultaneously with the death of the latter, 5 Feb., 1820, the Russians, who had banished the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> from St. Petersburg in 1815, expelled them from the whole country. It seems a remarkable providence that <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, contrary to all precedent, should have protected the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> just at the time when all other nations turned against them, and reverted to her normal hostility when the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> began to find toleration elsewhere. Upon the decease of Brzozowski, Father Petrucci, the vicar, fell under the influence of the still-powerful anti-Jesuit party to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and proposed to alter some points in the Institute. The twentieth general congregation took a severe view of his proposals, expelled him from the order, and elected Father Aloysius Fortis (18 Oct, 1820-27 Jan, 1829) (q.v.); <a href="../cathen/13182a.htm">John Roothaan</a> succeeded (9 July 1829-8 May 1853) and was followed by <a href="../cathen/02382b.htm">Peter Beckx</a> (2 July, 1853-4 March, 1887). <a href="../cathen/01466a.htm">Anton Maria Anderledy</a>, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> on 11 May, 1884, became general on <a href="../cathen/02382b.htm">Beckx's</a> death, and died on 18 Jan., 1892; Louis Martin (2 Oct, 1892-18 April, 1906). Father Martin commenced a new series of histories of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, to be based on the increasing materials now available, and to deal with many problems about which older <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalists</a>, Orlandi and his successors, were not curious. Volumes by Astrain, Duhr, Fouqueray, Hughes, Kroess, Tacchi-venturi have appeared. The present general, Francis Xavier Wernz, was elected on 8 Sept., 1906. Though the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of the nineteenth century cannot show a martry-roll as brilliant as that of their predecessors, the persecuting <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> passed against them surpass in number, extent, and continuance those endured by previous generations. The practical exclusion from <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> teaching, the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of military service in many countries, the wholesale confiscations of religious <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and the dispersion of twelve of its eldest and once most flourishing provinces are very serious hindrances to <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">religious vocations</a>. On a teaching order such blows fall very heavily. The cause of trouble has generally been due to that propaganda of irreligion which was developed during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> and is still active through <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Freemasonry</a> in those lands in which the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> took root.
<h2>France</h2>

<p>This is plainly seen in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In that country, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> began in 1815 with the direction of some <em>petits s&eacute;minaries</em> and congregations, and by giving missions. They were attacked by the liberals, especially by the Comte de Montlosier in 1823, and their <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, one of which St-Achuel, already contained 800 students, were closed in 1829. The Revolution of July (1830) brought them no relief; but in the visitation of cholera in 1832 the Fathers pressed to the fore, and so began to recover influence. In 1845, there was another attack by <a href="../cathen/14635b.htm">Thiers</a>, which drew out the answer of <a href="../cathen/12667b.htm">de Ravignan</a>. The revolution of 1848 at first sent them again into exile, but the liberal measures which succeeded, especially the freedom of teaching, enabled them to return and to open many <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (1850). In the later days of the Empire, greater difficulties were raised, but with the advent of the Third Republic (1870), these restrictions were removed and progress continued, until, after threatening measures in 1878, came the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 29 March, 1880, issued by M. Jules Ferry. This brought about a new dispersion and a substitution of staffs of non-religious teachers in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a>. But the French government did not press their enactments, and the Fathers returned by degrees; and before the end of the century, their houses and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> were as prosperous as ever. Then came the overwhelming Associations <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of M. Waldeck-Rousseau, leading to renewed by not complete dispersions and to the re-introduction of non-religious staffs in the colleges. The right of the order to hold <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was also <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> suppressed; and, by a refinement of cruelty, any <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> suspected of being held by a congregation may now be confiscated, unless it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> <em>not</em> to be so held. Other clauses of this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> penalize any meetings of the members of a congregation. The order is under an iron hand from which no escape is, humanly speaking, possible. For the moment nevertheless public opinion disapproves of its rigid execution, and thusfar in spite of all sufferings, of the dispersal of all houses, the confiscation of churches and the loss of practically all <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, the numbers of the order have been maintained, nay slightly increased, and so too have the opportunities for work, especially in literature and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, etc. (See also <a href="../cathen/03330a.htm">CARAYON</a>; DESCHAMPS; DU LAC; OLIVANT; <a href="../cathen/12667b.htm">RAVIGNAN</a>.)
<h2>Spain</h2>

<p>In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> the course of events has been similar. Recalled by Ferdinand VII in 1815, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> was attacked by the Revolution of 1820; and twenty-five <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were slain at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> in 1822. The Fathers, however, returned after 1823 and took part in the management of the military <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and the College of Nobles at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> (1827). But in 1834 they were again attacked at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, fourteen were killed and the whole order was banished on 4 July, 1835, by a Liberal ministry. After 1848 they began to return and were resettled after the Concordat, 26 Nov., 1852. At the Revolution of 1868 they were again banished (12 Oct.), but after a few years they were allowed to come back and have since made great progress. At the present time, however, another expulsion is threatened (1912). In <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were recalled in 1829, dispersed again in 1834; but afterwards returned. Though they were not formally sanctioned by law, they had a large college and several churches, from which, however, they were driven out in October, 1910, with great <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and cruelty.

<h2>Italy</h2>

<p>In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> they were expelled from <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> (1820-21) but in 1836 there were admitted to <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. Driven out by the Revolution of 1848 from almost the whole peninsula, they were able to return when peace was restored, except to <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>. Then with the gradual growth of United <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> they were step by step suppressed again by law everywhere, and finally at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1871. But though formally suppressed and unable to keep <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, except on a very small scale, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is so worded that it does not press at every point, nor is it often enforced with acrimony. Numbers do not fall off, and activities increase. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, they have charge, <em>inter alia</em>, of the Gregorian University, the "Institutum Biblicum", and the German and Latin-American colleges.
<h2>Germanic provinces</h2>

<p>Of the Germanic Provinces, that of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> may be said to have been recommenced by the immigration of many Polish Fathers from <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> to Galicia in 1820 and colleges were founded at Tarnopol, <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a>, Linz (1837), and <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a> in 1838, in which they were assigned the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty in 1856. The German province properly so called could at first make foundations only in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> at Brieg (1814) and Freiburg (1818). But after the <em>Sonderbund</em>, they were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave, then being 264 in number (111 priests). They were now able to open several houses in the Rhine provinces, etc., making steady progress until they were ejected during Bismark's <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> (1872), when they numbered 755 members (351 priests). They now count 1150 (with 574 priests) and are known throughout the world by their excellent publications. (See <a href="../cathen/01585a.htm">ANTONIEWICZ</a>; DEHARBE; <a href="../cathen/07149a.htm">HASSLACHER</a>; PESCH; ROH; SPILLMAN.)
<h2>Belgium</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were unable to return to their country till <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> was separated from <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> in 1830. Since then they have prospered exceedingly. In 1832, when they became a separate province, they numbered 105; at their 75 years' jubilee in 1907, they numbered 1168. In 1832, two colleges with 167 students; in 1907, 15 colleges with 7564 students. Congregations of the Blessed Virgin, originally founded by a <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, still flourish. In <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, 2529 such congregations have been aggregated to the <em>Prima Primaria</em> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and of these 156 are under <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> direction. To say nothing of missions and of retreats to <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, diocese, etc., the province had six houses of retreats, in which 245 retreats were given to 9840 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> supplies the foreign missions of Eastern Bengal and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/06349d.htm">Galle</a> in <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>. In the bush country of Chota Nagpur, there began, in 1887, a wonderful movement of aborigines (K&ocirc;les and Ouraons) toward the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in 1907 numbered 137,120 (i.e. 62,385 <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and 74,735 <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>). Over 35,000 conversions had been made in 1906, owing to the penetration of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> into the district of Jashpur. Besides this there are excellent colleges at Darjeeling and at Kurseong; at Candy in Ceylon the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> have charge of the great pontifical <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educating</a> native <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> for the whole of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. In all they have 442 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, or stations, 479 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 14,467 scholars, with about 167,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and 262 <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, of whom 150 are <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Fathers have also a flourishing mission in the Congo, in the districts of Kwango and Stanley Pool, which was begun in 1893; in 1907, the converts already numbered 31,402.
<h2>England</h2>

<p>Nowhere did the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> get through the troubles inevitable to the interim more easily than in conservative <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The college at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> continued to train their students in the old tradition, while the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> permitted the ex-Jesuits to maintain their missions and a sort of corporate discipline. But there were difficulties in recognizing the restored order, lest this should impede Emancipation (see Roman <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Relief Bill), which remained in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> for so many years. Eventually <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a>, on 1 Jan., 1829, declared the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of restoration to have force in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. After this the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> grew, slowly at first, but more rapidly afterwards. It had 73 members in 1815, 729 in 1910. The principal colleges are Stonyhurst (St. Omers, 1592, migrated to <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, 1762, to <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, 1773, to Stonyhurst, 1794); Mount St. Mary's (1842); Liverpool (1842); Beaumont (1861); Glasgow (1870); Wimbledon, <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> (1887); Stanford Hill, <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> (1894); Leeds (1905). The 1910, the province had in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, besides the usual <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and houses of study, two houses for retreats, 50 churches or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, attended by 148 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The congregations amounted to 97,641; <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a>, 3746; confessions 844,079; <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> confessions, 81,065; Communions, 1,303,591; converts, 725; extreme unctions, 1698; <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, 782; children in elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 18,328. The Guiana mission (19 priests) has charge of about 45,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; the Zambesi mission (35 priests), 4679 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. (See also the articles MORRIS; <a href="../cathen/12284b.htm">PORTER</a>; STEVENSON; COLERIDGE; <a href="../cathen/07141d.htm">HARPER</a>.)
<h2>Ireland</h2>

<p>There were 24 ex-Jesuits in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in 1776, but by 1803, only two. Of these, Father O'Callahan renewed his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> at <a href="../cathen/14309b.htm">Stonyhurst</a> in 1803, and he and Father Betagh, who was eventually the last survivor, succeeded in finding some excellent <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a> who made their <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in Stonyhurst, their studies at <a href="../cathen/11419b.htm">Palermo</a>, and returned between 1812 and 1814, Father Betagh, who had become <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, having survived to the year 1811. Father Peter Kenney (d. 1841) was the first superior of the new mission, a man of remarkable eloquence, who when visitor of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> in America (1830-1833) preached by invitation before Congress. From 1812-1813, he was vice-president of <a href="../cathen/10087b.htm">Maynooth College</a> under <a href="../cathen/10646b.htm">Dr. Murray</a>, the co-adjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. The College of Clonowes Wood was begun in 1813; Tullabeg in 1818 (now a house of both probations); Dublin (1841); Mungret (Apostolic School, 1883). In 1883, too, the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> trusted to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> the University College, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, in connection with the late Royal University of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The marked superiority of this college to the richly endowed Queen's Colleges of Belfast, <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a> contributed much to establish the claim of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to adequate <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. When this claim had been met by the present National University, the University College was returned to the Bishops. Five Fathers now hold teaching posts in the new <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and a hotel for students is being provided. Under the Act of Catholic Emancipation (q.v.) 58 <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were registered in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in 1830. In 1910 there were 367 in the province, of whom 100 are in <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>, where they have four colleges at and near Melbourne and Sydney, and missions in South Australia.

<p>Under the direction of Bishop Carroll the members of the Corporation of Roman <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">Clergymen</a> in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> were the chief factors in founding and maintaining <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown College</a> from 1791 to 1805, when they resumed their relations with the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> still existing in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and were so strongly reinforced by other members of the order from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> that they could assume full charge of the institution, which they have since retained. On the Restoration of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> in 1814 these nineteen fathers constituted the mission of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. For a time (1808 to 1817) some of them were employed in the Diocese of New York just erected, Father Anthony Kohlmann administering the diocese temporarily, others engaging in <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> work. In 1816, Gonzaga College, Washington, D. C., was founded. In 1833, the mission of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> became a province under the title of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. Since then the history of the province is a record of development proportionate with the growth in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> in the various fields specially cultivated by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. The colleges of the Holy Cross, <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> (founded in 1843), Loyola College, Baltimore (1852), Boston College (1863) have <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> great numbers of young men for the ministry and liberal professions. Up to 1879, members of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> had been labouring in New York as part of the New York-Canada mission. In that year, they became affiliated with the first American province under the title <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>-<a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">New York</a>. This was added to the old province besides several residences and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, the colleges of St. Frances Xavier and St. John (now <a href="../cathen/15203b.htm">Fordham University</a>), <a href="../cathen/11020a.htm">New York City</a>, and St. Peter's College, Jersey City, New Jersey. St. Joseph's College, Philadelphia, was chartered in 1852, and the Brooklyn College opened in 1908. In the same year, Canisius College, and two <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>, and one <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> in <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> for German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, with 88 members of the German province were affiliated with this province, which has now (1912) 863 members with 12 colleges and 13 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 1 house of higher study for the members of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in the New England and Middle States, and in the Virginias, with the Mission of Jamaica, British West Indies.

<p>The Missouri province began as a mission from <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> in 1823. Father Charles van Quickenborn, a <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a>, led several young men of his own nationality who were eager to work among the Indians, among them <a href="../cathen/04752a.htm">De Smet</a>, Van Assche, and Verhaegen. As a rule, the tribes were too nomadic to evangelize, and the Indian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> attracted only a very small number of pupils. The missions among the Osage and Pottawatomie were more permanent and fruitful. It was with experience gathered in these fields that <a href="../cathen/04752a.htm">Father De Smet</a> started his mission in the Rocky Mountains in 1840. A college, now St. Louis University, was opened in 1829. For ten years, 1838-48, a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was maintained at Grand Coteau, Louisiana; in 1840, St. Xavier's was opened at <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>. With the aid of seventy-eight <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who came over from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> in the years of revolution, 1838-48, two colleges were maintained, St. Joseph's, Bardstown, 1848 until 1861, another at <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, 1849-57. In this last year, a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was opened at <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>. The mission became a province in 1863; since then, colleges have been opened at <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, <a href="../cathen/11249b.htm">Omaha</a>, <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, St. Mary's (Kansas). By accession of part of the Buffalo mission when it was separated from the German province in 1907, the Missouri province acquired an additional 180 members, and colleges at <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>, Toledo, and Prarie du Chein, besides several residences and missions. Its members work in the Territory west of the Alleghenies as far as Kansas and Omaha, and from the lakes to the northern line of <a href="../cathen/14508a.htm">Tennessee</a> and Oklahoma, and also in the Mission of British Honduras.
<h3>New Orleans</h3>

<p>For five years, 1566-1571, members of the <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peruvian</a> province laboured among the Indians along the east coast of <a href="../cathen/06115b.htm">Florida</a>, where Father Martines was massacred near St. Augustine in 1566. They penetrated into <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>, where eight of their number were massacred by Indians at a station named Axaca, supposed to be on the Rappahannock River. Later, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> from <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, taking as their share of the Louisian territory the Illinois country and afterwards from the Ohio River to the gulf east of the Mississippi, worked among the Chocktaw, Chickasaw, <a href="../cathen/10709b.htm">Natchez</a>, <a href="../cathen/15732d.htm">Yazoo</a>. Two of their number were <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> by the Natchez, and one by the Chickasaw. Their expulsion in 1763 is the subject of a monograph by <a href="../cathen/03330a.htm">Carayon</a>, "Documents in&eacute;dits", XIV. Originally evangelized by <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> from the Lyons province, the <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> mission became a province in 1907, having seven colleges and four residences. It has now 255 members working in the territory north of the Gulf of Mexico to <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, and as far east as Virginia.
<h3>California</h3>

<p>In 1907, A province was formed in <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, comprising the missions of <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, the Rocky Mountains, and Alaska (United States). The history of these missions is narrated under <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> Missions; Missions, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian, of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>; Alaska; <a href="../cathen/07627a.htm">Idaho</a>; <a href="../cathen/14017a.htm">Sioux Indians</a>.
<h3>New Mexico</h3>

<p>In the mission of <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a> ninety-three <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> are occupied in the college at <a href="../cathen/04733c.htm">Denver, Colorado</a>, and in various missions in that state, <a href="../cathen/01719a.htm">Arizona</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a>; the mission depends on the Italian province of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. In all the provinces of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> there are 6 professional <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 4363 students; 26 colleges with full courses, with 2417, and 34 preparatory and high schools with 8735 pupils.
<h2>Canada</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> returned to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> from St. Mary's College, <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, which had been taken over, in 1834, by members of the province of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. When St. Mary's was given up in 1846, the staff came to take charge of St. John's College, <a href="../cathen/15203b.htm">Fordham</a>, New York, thus forming with their fellows in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> the New York-Canada mission. This mission lasted till 1879, the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> division having by that year 1 college, 2 residences, 1 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, 3 <a href="../cathen/10378a.htm">Indian missions</a>, and 131 members. In 1888 the mission received $160,000 as its part of the sum paid by the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a> in compensation for the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> estates appropriated under George III by imperial authority, and transferred to the authorities of the former Province of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, all parties thus agreeing that the full amount, $400,000, thus allowed was far short of the value of the estates, estimated at $2,000,000. The settlement was ratified by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and the legislature of the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>, and the balance was divided among the archdiocese of Quebec, <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, and other diocese, the <a href="../cathen/09047b.htm">Laval University</a> besides receiving, in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, $40,000 and in Quebec, $100,000.

<p>In 1907 the mission was constituted a province. It now has two colleges in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, one at St. Boniface with 263 students in the collegiate and 722 in the preparatory classes, 2 residences and churches in Quebec, one at <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a>, <a href="../cathen/10378a.htm">Indian missions</a>, and missions in <a href="../cathen/01246b.htm">Alaska</a>, and 309 members.
<h2>Mexico</h2>

<p>In Mexico (New Spain) <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries began their work in 1571, and prior to their expulsion, in 1767, they numbered 678 members of whom 468 were natives. They had over 40 colleges or <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, 5 residences, and 6 missionary districts, with 99 missions. The mission included Cuba, lower <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, and as far south as Nicaragua. Three members of the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppressed Society</a> who were in Mexico at the time of the Restoration formed a nucleus for its re-establishment there in 1816. In 1820, there were 32, of whom 15 were <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 3 scholastics, in care of 4 colleges and 3 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. They were dispersed in 1821. Although invited back in 1843, they could not agree to the limitations put on their activities by General Santa Anna, nor was the prospect favourable in the revolutionary condition of the country. Four of their number returning in 1854, the mission prospered, and in spite of two dispersions, 1859 and 1873, it has continued to increase in number and activity. In August, 1907, it was reconstituted a province, It has now 326 members with four colleges, 12 residences, 6 mission stations among the Tarahumara, and a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> (see also Mexico; Pious Fund of the Californias).
