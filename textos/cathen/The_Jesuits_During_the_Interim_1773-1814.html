<h1>The Jesuits During the Interim (1773-1814)</h1>  

<p>The execution of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of Suppression having been largely left to local <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, there was room for a good deal of variety in the treatment the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> might receive in different places. In <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> they were generally allowed to teach (but with <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> as superiors); often they became men of mark as preachers, like Beauregard, Muzzarelli, and Alexander Lanfant (b. at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, 6 Sept. 1726, and massacred in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 3 Sept. 1793) and writers like <a href="../cathen/06034a.htm">Francios-X. de Feller</a>, Zaccharia, Ximenes. The first to receive open official <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of their new works were probably the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who in 1778 obtained a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> approving their well-known Academy of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> (now at <a href="../cathen/14309b.htm">Stonyhurst</a>). But in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and until 1780 in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, the Empress Catherine and King <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> desired to maintain the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> as a teaching body. They forbade the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgate</a> the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> until their <em>placet</em> was obtained. Bishop Massalski in White Russia, 19 September, 1773 therefore ordered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> superiors to continue to exercise <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> till further notice. On 2 February, 1780, with the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of Bishop Siestrzencewicz's Apostolic visitor, a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> was opened. To obtain higher sanction for what had been done, the envoy Benislaski was sent by Catherine to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. But it must be remembered that the animus of the Boubon courts against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> was still unchecked; and in some countries, as in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> under <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>, the situation was worse than before. There were many in the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> who had worked their way up by their activity against the order, or held pensions created out of former <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> declined to meet Catherine's requests. All he could do was express an indefinite assent by word of mouth, without issuing any written documents, or observing the usual formalities; and he ordered that strict secrecy should be observed about the whole mission. Benislaski received these messages on 12 March, 1783, and later gave the Russian <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> an attestation of them (24 July, 1785).

<p>On the other hand, it can cause no wonder that the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> should from the first have watched the survival in White Russia with jealousy, and have brought pressure to bear on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to ensure their suppression. He was constrained to declare that he had not revoked the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of Suppression, and that he regarded as an abuse anything done against it, but that the Empress Catherine would not allow him to act freely (29 July, 1783). These utterances were not in real conflict with the answer given to Benislaski, which only amount to an assertion that the escape from the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> was not <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> approved of their continuing as they were doing. Their existence was therefore legitimate, or at least not illegitimate, though positive approval in legal form did not come until <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII's</a> brief "Catholic&aelig; Fidei" (7 March, 1801). Meanwhile the same or similar causes to those which brought about the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">Suppression of the Society</a> were leading to the disruption of the whole civil order. The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> (1789) was overthrowing every throne that had combined against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and in the anguish of that trial, many were the cries for the re-establishment of the order. But amid the turmoil of the Napoleonic Wars, during the long captivity of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> (1798-1800) and of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> (1809-1814), such a consummation was impossible. The <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, however (whose academy at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, driven over to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> by the French invasion of 1794, had been approved by a brief in 1796), succeeded in obtaining oral permission from <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> for their aggregation to the Russian <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, 27 May, 1803. The commission was to be kept secret, and was not even communicated by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>. Next winter, its prefect, <a href="../cathen/02685a.htm">Cardinal Borgia</a>, wrote a hostile letter, not indeed canceling the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> take, or blaming what had been done, but forbidding the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> "to recognize the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>" or "to admit their privileges until their obtained permission from the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a>.

<p>Considering the extreme difficulties of the times, we cannot wonder at orders being given from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> which were not always quite consistent. Broadly speaking, however, we see that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> worked their way towards a restoration of the order by degrees. First, by approving community life, which had been specifically forbidden by the Brief of Suppression (this was done in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1778). Second, by permitting <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> (for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1803). Third, by restoring the full privileges of a religious order (these were not recognized in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> until 1829). The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> was extended by Brief from Russia to the Kingdom of Naples, 30 July, 1804; but on the invasion of the French in 1806, all houses were dissolved, except those in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. The Superior in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> during these changes was the Venerable Giuseppe M. Pignatelli. In their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the re-establishment of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> some of the ex-Jesuits united themselves into congregations which might, while avoiding the now-unpopular name of <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, preserve some of its essential features. Thus arose the Fathers of Faith (Peres de la Foi), founded with papal sanction by Nicholas Paccanari in 1797. A somewhat similar congregation, called <a href="../cathen/13306b.htm">"The Fathers of the Sacred Heart"</a>, had been commenced in 1794 in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, under P&egrave;re Charles de Broglie, who was succeeded by P&egrave;re Joseph Varin as superior. By the wish of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, the two congregations amalgamated, and were generally known as the Paccanarists. They soon spread to many lands; Paccanari, however, did not prove to be a good superior, and seemed to be working against a union with the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> still in Russia; this caused P&egrave;re Varin and others to leave him. Some of them entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> in Russia at once; and at the Restoration, the others joined <em>en masse</em>.
