<h1>The Jordan</h1>  

<p>(In Hebrew <em>Y&#226;d&#234;n,</em> from the root <em>Y&#226;r&#226;d,</em> to descend).

<p>The difference of elevation between the highest point of this river (1847 feet above the sea-level) and the lowest (1286 feet below the sea-level) is 3133 feet. It issues from the side of <a href="../cathen/07288a.htm">Mount Hermon</a> by three principal sources: the Nahr el Hasb&#226;ni, coming from Hasbeya; the Nahr el Ledd&#226;n, which rises at Tell el Q&#226;di (the ancient La&#239;s-Dan); and the Nahr Banias, the glory of what was C&aelig;sarea Philippi. Formed at a point about five and a half miles below Banias, by the junction of these three streams, the Jordan enters Lake H&#251;leh about nine and a third miles lower down. This lake, which is probably "the waters of Merom", is rather more than three and a half miles in length. Between the Bahrat el H&#251;leh and the <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">Lake of Tiberias</a>, nearly ten miles, the Jordan is clear, and in some places reaches a width of over twenty yards and a depth of nearly seventeen feet. It is crossed by a bridge which connects Damascus with <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, the Jisr Ben&#226;t Yaq&#251;b. Near et Tell, which is Bethsaida Julias, the river enters the Sea of Genesareth, which is 682 feet below the level of the Mediterranean and is more than thirteen miles in length. Leaving the lake towards Samakh, the Jordan commences its innumerable wanderings. The direct distance from the <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">Lake of Tiberias</a> to the Dead Sea is sixty-five miles, but the Jordan, owing to its sinuosities, has a course of 200 miles. At a little distance from where it leaves the lake there are remains of two bridges, Jisr es Semakh and Jisr es Sidd, and in this reach of the river it is still fordable at many points. At about six and a quarter miles from the lake, after receiving the Yarmuk, it passes under an old <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> basalt bridge, the Jisr el M&#251;djamieh, and the bridge of the railroad from Ca&#239;ffa to Damascus.

<p>Beyond the Wadi 'Arab is the ford of Ab&#226;h, where some locate the Bethbera of the story of Gedeon (<a href="../bible/jdg007.htm#vrs24">Judges 7:24</a>). At five and a half miles from the mouth of the Jal&#251;d, which passes Beis&#226;n (Scythopolis), the Jordan passes between Tell es S&#226;rem (Salim) and Tabaq&#226;t Tahil (Pella). It receives, three and three-quarters miles from Salim, the water of such important springs as the B&#234;da and 'Ain esh Shemsieh, where the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> tradition placed <a href="../cathen/01173b.htm">Ennon</a>: "John also was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> in <a href="../cathen/01173b.htm">Ennon</a> near Salim" (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs23">John 3:23</a>). Umm el Amd&#226;n, which is very near, was supposed, in the fourth century, to be the Salem of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>. Over against these springs the W&#226;di Yab&#238;s rushes down precipitately, the name of which recalls Jabes Galaad, delivered by Saul (<a href="../bible/1sa011.htm">1 Samuel 11</a>). From the lake to this point the whole valley is cultivated; thence to Sartabeh, the mountains of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> reach to the river. Opposite Sartabeh is the confluence of the Nahr es Zerqa (Jabbok), and just below are to be seen the ruins of the Roman bridge of Damieh, and the ford of the same name which must have played a part in the well-known episode of Sibboleth (<a href="../bible/jdg012.htm#vrs5">Judges 12:5, 6</a>). The utensils and the columns of the Temple of Solomon were cast near here (<a href="../bible/1ki007.htm#vrs46">1 Kings 7:46</a>). From Damieh onwards the valley ceases to be cultivated; the waters of the Jordan, disturbed by rapids, become yellow and muddy. A two-hours' journey north-east of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> are to be found the wooden bridge and the ford of Gh&ocirc;ranieh, where the great highways of Galaad and <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> meet. The Greek <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Qars el Yeh&#251;d, two and a half miles farther down the river, marks the traditional scene of the passage of the Hebrews (<a href="../bible/jos003.htm#vrs9">Joshua 3:9-13</a>) and of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm">Matthew 3</a>). The scene of the ministrations of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>, however, has been very plausibly placed at the ford of the Gh&ocirc;ranieh, which has always been more frequented. In its lower portion the river is swelled by many affluents, which formerly watered a part of the Kikkar, whither <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> came when he parted from Abraham; these affluents are the W&#226;di Kefren, and the W&#226;di Nimrin.

<p>The Jordan, called by the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> esh Sheriat el Kebir (the great drinking-place), flows between steep banks of rather brittle clay. The lower part of its basin is called the Z&ocirc;r, the bottom of the valley is the Gh&ocirc;r. It is fringed with trees and shrubs&mdash;poplar, tamarisk, rhododendron, agnus castus, apple of Sodom&mdash;and its waters contain a great many fish&mdash;various species of <em>capocta,</em> the <em>barbus canis,</em> the <em>cyprinodon,</em> and a kind of catfish (<em>silurus</em>). Vipers, scorpions, porcupines, jackals, wild boars, ibexes, panthers (<em>nimr</em>), and a great variety of birds are found in the neighbouring thickets. A tropical temperature predominates. The water of the Jordan contains a saline residuum, chlorine, sodium, sulphuric acid, and magnesia. The floods of the river occur from February to May. Its width is very variable: at Gh&ocirc;ranieh scarcely more than twenty-seven yards; at the ford of el Hen&#251; as much as forty-five to fifty-five yards; at its mouth about eighty yards. The volume of water brought to the Dead Sea by the Jordan is calculated to be, on the average, 883 cubic feet per second.
