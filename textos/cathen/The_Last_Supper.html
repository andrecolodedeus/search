<h1>The Last Supper</h1>  

<p>The meal held by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> on the eve of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> at which He instituted the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>.
<h2>Time</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> and critics generally agree that the Last Supper was on a Thursday, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">suffered and died</a> on Friday, and that He <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">arose from the dead</a> on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a>. As to the day of the month there seems a difference between the record of the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">synoptic Gospels</a> and that of <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">St. John</a>. In consequence some critics have rejected the <a href="../cathen/02137b.htm">authenticity</a> of either account or of both. Since <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, accepting the <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">inspiration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptures</a>, cannot admit contradictions in the sacred writers, various attempts have been made to reconcile the statements. Matthew 26:17 says, "And on the first day of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Azymes</a>"; Mark 14:12, "Now on the first day of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">unleavened bread</a>, when they <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">pasch</a>"; Luke 22:7, "And the day of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">unleavened bread</a> came, on which it was necessary that the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">pasch</a> should be killed". From these passages it seems to follow that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> conformed to the ordinary custom, that the Last Supper took place on the 14th of Nisan, and that the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Crucifixion</a> was on the 15th, the great festival of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. This opinion, held by Tolet, <a href="../cathen/04377a.htm">Cornelius a Lapide</a>, <a href="../cathen/11559a.htm">Patrizi</a>, Corluy, Hengstenberg, Ohlshausen, and Tholuck, is confirmed by the custom of the early <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> which, looking to the day of the month, celebrated the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">commemoration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord's</a> Last Supper on the 14th of Nisan, without paying any attention to the day of the week. This was done in conformity with the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a>. But in his <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">Gospel</a>, <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John</a> seems to indicate that Friday was the 14th of Nisan, for (18:28) on the morning of this day the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> "went not into the hall, that they might not be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">defiled</a>, but that they might eat the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">pasch</a>". Various things were done on this Friday which could not be done on a feast, viz., <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is arrested, tried, crucified; His body is taken down" (because it was the parasceve) that the bodies might not remain upon the <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a> on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a> (for that was a great <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>)"; the <a href="../cathen/13762a.htm">shroud</a> and ointments are bought, and so on.

<p>The defenders of this opinion claim that there is only an apparent contradiction and that the differing statements may be reconciled. For the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> calculated their festivals and <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a> from sunset to sunset: thus the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> began after sunset on Friday and ended at sunset on Saturday. This style is employed by the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">synoptic Gospels</a>, while <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John</a>, writing about twenty-six years after the destruction of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, when Jewish law and customs no longer prevailed, may well have used the Roman method of computing time from midnight to midnight. The word <em>pasch</em> does not exclusively apply to the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">paschal lamb</a> on the eve of the feast, but is used in the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptures</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/14435b.htm">Talmud</a> in a wider sense for the entire festivity, including the <em>chagigah</em>; any <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">legal defilement</a> could have been removed by the evening ablutions; trials, and even <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">executions</a> and many servile works, though forbidden on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, were not forbidden on feasts (<a href="../bible/num028.htm#vrs16">Numbers 28:16</a>; <a href="../bible/deu016.htm#vrs23">Deuteronomy 16:23</a>). The word <em>parasceve</em> may denote the preparation for any <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> and may be the common designation for any Friday, and its connexion with <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">pasch</a> need not mean preparation for the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> but Friday of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> season and hence this <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> was a great <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. Moreover it seems quite certain that if <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">St. John</a> intended to give a different date from that given by the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptics</a> and sanctioned by the custom of his own <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at Ephesus, he would have said so expressly. Others accept the apparent statement of <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">St. John</a> that the Last Supper was on the 13th of Nisan and try to reconcile the account of the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptics</a>. To this class belong <a href="../cathen/11588a.htm">Paul of Burgos</a>, <a href="../cathen/09567a.htm">Maldonatus</a>, <a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">P&eacute;tau</a>, <a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a>, <a href="../cathen/14724b.htm">Tillemont</a>, and others. <a href="../cathen/11771a.htm">Peter of Alexandria</a> (P.G., XCII, 78) says: "In previous years <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had kept the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> and eaten the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">paschal lamb</a>, but on the day before He <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">suffered</a> as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">Paschal Lamb</a> He taught His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">type</a>." Others say: Since the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a>, falling that year on a Friday, was reckoned as a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, to avoid the inconvenience of two successive <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>, had postponed the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> for a day, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> adhered to the day fixed by law; others think that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> anticipated the celebration, knowing that the proper time He would be in the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">grave</a>.
<h2>Place</h2>

<p>The owner of the house in which was the upper room of the Last Supper is not mentioned in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>; but he must have been one of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> bids <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> say, "The Master says". Some say it was <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, or <a href="../cathen/08520a.htm">Joseph of Arimathea</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/09749a.htm">mother of John Mark</a>. The hall was large and furnished as a dining-room. In it <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> showed Himself after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>; here took place the <a href="../cathen/05374b.htm">election</a> of <a href="../cathen/10066a.htm">Matthias</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolate</a> and the sending of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; here the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> assembled for the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">breaking of bread</a>; hither <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> came when they had given testimony after the cure of the man born lame, and <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> after his liberation from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>; here perhaps was the council of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> held. It was for awhile the only church in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, the mother of all churches, known as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> or of Sion. It was visited in 404 by <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">St. Paula of Rome</a>. In the eleventh century it was destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, later rebuilt and given to the care of the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Augustinians</a>. Restored after a second destruction, it was placed in charge of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, who were driven out in 1561. At present it is a <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> mosque.
<h2>Sequence of events</h2>

<p>Some critics give the following harmonized order: <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">washing of the feet</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, prediction of the betrayal and departure of <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>, institution of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>. Others, believing that <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> made a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">communion</a>, place the institution of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">sacrament</a> before the departure of <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>.
<h2>In art</h2>

<p>The Last Supper has been a favourite subject. In the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> we find representations of meals giving at least an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the surroundings of an ancient dining hall. Of the sixth century we have a <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-relief</a> in the church at Monza in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, a picture in a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codex</a> of the Laurentian Library at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> in S. Apollmare Nuovo at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. One of the most popular <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">pictures</a> is that of <a href="../cathen/15440a.htm">Leonardo da Vinci</a> in Santa Maria delle Grazie, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. Among the modern school of German artists, the Last Supper of Gebhardt is regarded as a masterpiece.
