<h1>The Leopoldine Society</h1>  

<p>Established at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> for the purpose of aiding the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missions in North America. When the Society for the Propagation of Faith was founded at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, in 1822, it did not spread beyond the French borders for a considerable time. Other nations were not unwilling to cooperate, but were deliberating whether to start a similar <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of their own or to join the one already in existence. At this time, in 1827, Bishop Fenwick of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, sent his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, Father Rese, to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to recruit German <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and to obtain assistance for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Father Rese reached <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in the latter part of 1828. He was received everywhere most cordially and inspired those with whom he came in contact with a great interest in the American missions. His graphic descriptions of the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>, the great possibilities for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the scarcity of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the prevailing poverty of the missions awoke a general public interest in the welfare of the American missions. To strengthen this feeling and encourage the formation of a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> similar to the French <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> he published a description of the <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Diocese of Cincinnati</a> ("Abriss der Geschichte des Bisthums Cincinnati in Nord-America", Vienna, 1829), an excerpt from <a href="../cathen/02200b.htm">Father Theodore Badin's</a> work. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, Leopold Maximilian Graf von Firmian, was so well disposed towards the noble undertaking that he brought it to the notice of the imperial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, Father Rese was granted an audience with the emperor, whose brother, Archduke Rudolph, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Olmutz, assumed the protectorate of the missionary work.

<p>The sanction of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was next obtained. <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Quamquam plura sint", <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 30 Jan., 1829, approved of the nascent <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Meanwhile the founders were busying themselves with the internal workings of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. A public meeting was held on 13 March, 1829, at the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> palace. Canon Joseph Pletz, of the Metropolitan Church of St. Stephen, spoke on the propagation of the Gospel and its civilizing influences upon the nations of the world. A month later, 15 April, 1829, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> were adopted. These were drawn up much after the pattern of the French <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. The only divergent points which need be mentioned were that the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was to be known as the Leopoldine Society &#151; Leopoldinen Stiftung &#151; to perpetuate the memory of the Empress of <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, Leopoldina, a favourite daughter of Francis I and wife of Pedro I; and that the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> should exist only in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a>. On 13 May, 1829, the first executive session was held. A pamphlet was designed and in it incorporated the oration of Canon Pletz together with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> and the corresponding regulations. The brochure was translated into all the languages spoken in the monarchy. The head office was established in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and Herr Anton Carl Lichtenberg became its first actuary and Dr. Caspar Wagner its treasurer.

<p>The seed was sown. Five kreutzers a week &#151; about two cents &#151; was a small contribution; however, little by little the fund commenced to swell so that from July to October, 1830, the collection amounted to $19,930. On 30 April, 1830, a first draft of $10,256.04 was sent to Bishop Fenwick and four months later a second one of $5200, "to afford ample help and not to deal out the money in small bits and give relief practically to nobody" (Berichte der Leopoldinen Stiftung, I). The general interest awakened by the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> for the American missions not only brought out funds but donations of church utensils, Mass paraphernalia, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, statuary, etc. These objects were often donated by members of the imperial house. Directly due to the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> were many vocations to the missions from among the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. First amongst these was the <a href="../cathen/02282b.htm">Rev. Frederic Baraga</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09689a.htm">Marquette</a>. His example was followed by [St. John] Neumann (afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Philadelphia), Hatscher, Sanderl, Viszoczky, Belleis, Pisbach, Hammer, Kundeck, Cvitkovich, Schuh, Levic, Pirec, Skolla, Godec, Krutil, Veranek, Burg, Buchmayr, Bayer, Hasslinger, Count Coudenhove, <a href="../cathen/10624d.htm">Mrak</a> (afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09689a.htm">Marquette</a>), Skopec, Etschmann, and many others &#151; all of whom entered the missions before 1850.

<p>The beneficiaries of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> are principally the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Among the older ones Cincinnati has been most bountifully considered, but St. Louis, Bardstown, <a href="../cathen/03630a.htm">Charleston</a>, Philadelphia, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, <a href="../cathen/10410a.htm">Mobile</a>, <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, New York, <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, <a href="../cathen/10704c.htm">Nashville</a>, <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, <a href="../cathen/10709b.htm">Natchez</a>, Vincennes, <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>, <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/07144a.htm">Hartford</a>, <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, <a href="../cathen/09689a.htm">Marquette</a>, <a href="../cathen/06372a.htm">Galveston</a>, <a href="../cathen/09295a.htm">Little Rock</a>, received generous support. Then, besides the travelling expenses of the different missionaries and personal aid to them, <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities were enabled with the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society's</a> assistance to send workers to the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society's</a> fund built numerous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and churches and enabled many a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to devoted his life to the missions, kindling and keeping the light of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the hearts of men who otherwise must have lived and died without it. The Leopoldine Society expended upon the American <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missions, from 1830 to 1910, the sum of 3,402,211 kronen (about 680,500 dollars). The <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> still exists and although its collections are small it continues its mission. The contributions chiefly come from the Austrian emperor, the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, Sankt P&ouml;lten, Brun, <a href="../cathen/13672a.htm">Seckau</a>, <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz. Eighty-one official reports, "Berichte der Leopoldinen Stiftung", have appeared. These are replete with the struggles and glories of the American missions and missionaries and invaluable for data in the American <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>.
