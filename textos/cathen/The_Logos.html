<h1>The Logos</h1>  

<p>The word <em>Logos</em> is the term by which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> in the Greek language designates the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or Second Person of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a>. Before St. John had <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> this term by adopting it, the Greeks and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had used it to express religious conceptions which, under various titles, have exercised a certain influence on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, and of which it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to say something.
<h2 id="section1">The <em>logos</em> in Hellenism</h2>

<p>It is in Heraclitus that the theory of the Logos appears for the first time, and it is doubtless for this reason that, first among the Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, Heraclitus was regarded by <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> (Apol. I, 46) as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> before Christ. For him the Logos, which he seems to identify with fire, is that universal principle which animates and rules the world. This conception could only find place in a materialistic monism. The <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the fifth and fourth centuries before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were dualists, and conceived of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as transcendent, so that neither in <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> (whatever may have been said on the subject) nor in <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> do we find the theory of the Logos.

<p>It reappears in the writings of the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, and it is especially by them that this theory is developed. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to them, "did not make the world as an artisan does his work, but it is by wholly penetrating all matter that He is the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">demiurge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>" (Galen, "De qual. incorp." in "Fr. Stoic.", ed. von Arnim, II, 6); He penetrates the world "as honey does the honeycomb" (<a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, "Adv. Hermogenem", 44), this <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so intimately mingled with the world is fire or ignited air; inasmuch as He is the principle controlling the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, He is called <em>Logos</em>; and inasmuch as He is the germ from which all else develops, He is called the <em>seminal Logos (logos spermatikos)</em>. This Logos is at the same time a force and a law, an irresistible force which bears along the entire world and all creatures to a common end, an inevitable and holy law from which nothing can withdraw itself, and which every reasonable man should follow willingly (Cleanthus, "Hymn to Zeus" in "Fr. <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a>." I, 527-cf. 537). Conformably to their <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> habits, the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> made of the different gods personifications of the Logos, e.g. of Zeus and above all of Hermes.

<p>At Alexandria, Hermes was identified with Thoth, the god of Hermopolis, known later as the great Hermes, "Hermes Trismegistus", and represented as the revealer of all letters and all religion. Simultaneously, the Logos theory conformed to the current Neoplatonistic <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a> in Alexandria: the Logos is not conceived of as nature or immanent necessity, but as an intermediary agent by which the transcendent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> governs the world. This conception appears in Plutarch, especially in his "Isis and Osiris"; from an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> in the first century of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> era, it influenced profoundly the Jewish <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Philo.
<h2 id="section2">The word in Judaism</h2>

<p>Quite frequently the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> represents the creative act as the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#vrs3">Genesis 1:3</a>; <a href="../bible/psa032.htm#vrs9">Psalm 32:9</a>; <a href="../bible/sir042.htm#vrs15">Sirach 42:15</a>); sometimes it seems to attribute to the word action of itself, although not independent of <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Jahveh</a> (<a href="../bible/isa055.htm#vrs11">Isaiah 55:11</a>, <a href="../bible/zec005.htm#vrs1">Zechariah 5:1-4</a>; <a href="../bible/psa106.htm#vrs20">Psalm 106:20</a>; <a href="../bible/psa147.htm#vrs15">147:15</a>). In all this we can see only bold figures of speech: the word of creation, of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, or, in Zacharias, the word of malediction, is personified, but is not conceived of as a distinct Divine hypostasis. In the <a href="../cathen/15666a.htm">Book of Wisdom</a> this personification is more directly implied (<a href="../bible/wis018.htm">18:15 sq.</a>), and a parallel is established (<a href="../bible/wis009.htm">9:1-2</a>) between wisdom and the Word.

<p>In Palestinian Rabbinism the Word (<em>Memra</em>) is very often mentioned, at least in the Targums: it is the Memra of <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Jahveh</a> which lives, speaks, and acts, but, if one endeavour to determine precisely the meaning of the expression, it appears very often to be only a paraphrase substituted by the Targumist for the name of <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Jahveh</a>. The Memra resembles the Logos of Philo as little as the workings of the rabbinical mind in Palestine resembled the speculations of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>: the rabbis are chiefly concerned about ritual and observances; from religious scruples they dare not attribute to <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Jahveh</a> actions such as the Sacred Books attribute to Him; it is enough for them to veil the Divine Majesty under an abstract paraphrase, the Word, the Glory, the Abode, and others. Philo's problem was of the philosophic order; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> distant from each other, and it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to establish between them relations of action and of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; the Logos is here the intermediary.

<p>Leaving aside the author of the <a href="../cathen/15666a.htm">Book of Wisdom</a>, other Alexandrian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> before Philo had speculated as to the Logos; but their works are known only through the rare fragments which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> authors and Philo himself have preserved. Philo alone is fully known to us, his writings are as extensive as those of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> or Cicero, and throw light on every aspect of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>; from him we can best learn the theory of the Logos, as developed by Alexandrian <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>. The character of his teaching is as manifold as its sources: <ul><li>sometimes, influenced by Jewish tradition, Philo represents the Logos as the creative Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ("De Sacrific. Ab. et Cain"; cf. "De Somniis", I 182; "De Opif. Mundi", 13); <li>at other times he describes it as the revealer of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, symbolized in Scripture by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of Jahveh</a> ("De Somniis", I, 228-39, "De Cherub.", 3; "De Fuga", 5; "Quis rer. divin. haeres sit", 201-205). <li>Oftener again he accepts the language of Hellenic speculation; the Logos is then, after a <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonistic</a> concept, the sum total of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and the intelligible world ("De Opif. Mundi", 24, 25; "Leg. Alleg.", I, 19; III, 96), <li>or, agreeably to the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> theory, the power that upholds the world, the bond that assures its cohesion, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that determines its development ("De Fuga", 110; "De Plantat. <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>," 8-10; "Quis rer. divin. haeres sit", 188, 217; "Quod Deus sit immut.", 176; "De Opif. Mundi", 143). </ul>



<p>Throughout so many diverse concepts may be recognized a fundamental <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>: the Logos is an intermediary between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the world; through it <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> created the world and governs it; through it also men <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to Him ("De Cherub.", 125; "Quis rerum divin. haeres sit", 205-06.) In three passages the Logos is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ("Leg. Alleg.", III, 207; "De Somniis", I, 229; "In Gen.", II, 62, cited by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, "Praep. Ev.", VII, 13); but, as Philo himself explains in one of these texts (De Somniis), it is an improper appellation and wrongly employed, and he uses it only because he is led into it by the Sacred Text which he comments upon. Moreover, Philo does not regard the Logos as a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; it is an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, a power, and, though occasionally identified with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, this is by symbolic personification.
<h2 id="section3">The <em>logos</em> in the New Testament</h2>

<p>The term <em>Logos</em> is found only in the Johannine writings: in the Apocalypse (19:13), in the Gospel of St. John (1:1-14), and in his First Epistle (1:1; cf. 1:7 - <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>). But already in the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of the Logos had made its influence felt. This is seen in the Epistles to the Corinthians, where Christ is called "the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#vrs24">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>) and "the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/2co004.htm#vrs4">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>); it is more evident in the Epistle to the Colossians (1:15 sqq.); above all in the Epistle to the Hebrews, where the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of the Logos lacks only the term itself, that finally appears in St. John. In this epistle we also notice the pronounced influence of the <a href="../cathen/15666a.htm">Book of Wisdom</a>, especially in the description which is given of the relations between the Son and the Father: "the brightness of his glory, and the figure of his substance" (cf. <a href="../bible/wis007.htm#vrs26">Wisdom 7:26</a>). This resemblance suggests the way by which the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Logos entered into <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>; another clue is furnished by the Apocalypse, where the term <em>Logos</em> appears for the first time (19:13), and not apropos of any <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> teaching, but in an apocalyptic vision, the content of which has no suggestion of Philo but rather recalls Wisdom 18:15.

<p>In the Gospel of St. John the Logos appears in the very first verse without explanation, as a term familiar to the readers, St. John uses it at the end of the prologue (i, 14), and does not mention it again in the Gospel. From this Harnack concludes that the mention of the Word was only a starting-point for the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a>, and that he passed directly from this Hellenic conception of the Logos to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> of the only Son ("Ueber das Verh&auml;ltniss des Prologs des vierten Evangeliums zum ganzen Werk" in "Zeitschrift fur Theol. und Kirche", II, 1892, 189-231). This hypothesis is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> by the insistence with which the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> comes back on this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the Word, it is, moreover, natural enough that this technical term, employed in the prologue where the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> is interpreting the Divine mystery, should not reappear in the sequel of the narrative, the character of which might thus suffer change.

<p>What is the precise value of this concept in the writings of St. John? The Logos has not for him the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> meaning that it so often had for Philo: it is not the impersonal power that sustains the world, nor the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that regulates it; neither do we find in St. John the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonistic</a> concept of the Logos as the ideal model of the world; the Word is for him the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and thereby he holds with Jewish tradition, the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15666a.htm">Book of Wisdom</a>, of the Psalms, of the Prophetical Books, and of Genesis; he perfects the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> and transforms it by showing that this creative Word which from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> was in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, took flesh and dwelt among men.

<p>This difference is not the only one which distinguishes the Johannine <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of the Logos from the concept of Philo, to which not a few have sought to liken it. The Logos of Philo is impersonal, it is an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, a power, a law; at most it may be likened to those half abstract, half-concrete entities, to which the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> mythology had lent a certain personal form. For Philo the incarnation of the Logos must have been absolutely without meaning, quite as much as its identification with the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>. For St. John, on the contrary, the Logos appears in the full light of a concrete and living <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>; it is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. Equally great is the difference when we consider the role of the Logos. The Logos of Philo is an intermediary: "The Father who engendered all has given to the Logos the signal privilege of being an intermediary (<em>methorios</em>) between the creature and the creator . . . it is neither without beginning (<em>agenetos</em>) as is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor begotten (<em>genetos</em>) as you are [<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>], but intermediate (<em>mesos</em>) between these two extremes "(Quis rer. divin. haeres sit, 205-06). The Word of St. John is not an intermediary, but a Mediator; He is not intermediate between the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, Divine and human, but He unites them in His Person; it could not be said of Him, as of the Logos of Philo, that He is neither <em>agenetos</em> nor <em>genetos</em>, for He is at the same time one and the other, not inasmuch as He is the Word, but as the Incarnate Word (St. Ignatius, "Ad Ephes.", vii, 2).

<p>In the subsequent history of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> many conflicts would naturally arise between these rival concepts, and Hellenic speculations constitute a dangerous temptation for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writers. They were hardly tempted, of course, to make the Divine Logos an impersonal power (the Incarnation too definitely forbade this), but they were at times moved, more or less consciously, to consider the Word as an intermediary being between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the world. Hence arose the subordinationist tendencies found in certain Ante-Nicene writers; hence, also, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian heresy</a> (see COUNCIL OF NICAEA).
<h2 id="section4">The <em>logos</em> in ancient Christian literature</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01637a.htm">Apostolic Fathers</a> do not touch on the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of the Logos; a short notice occurs in St. Ignatius only (Ad Magn. viii, 2). The Apologists, on the contrary, develop it, partly owing to their philosophic training, but more particularly to their desire to state their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in a way familiar to their readers (<a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a>, for example, insists strongly on the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of the Logos in his "Apology" meant for <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, much less so in his "Dialogue with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> Tryphon"). This anxiety to adapt apologetic discussion to the circumstances of their hearers had its dangers, since it was possible that in this way the apologists might land well inside the lines of their adversaries.

<p>As to the capital question of the generation of the Word, the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of the Apologists is irreproachable: the Word was not created, as the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> held later, but was born of the very Substance of the Father according to the later definition of Nicaea (<a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a>, <a href="../fathers/01289.htm"><em>Dialogue with Trypho</em> 128</a>; <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, "Or.", v; <a href="../cathen/02042b.htm">Athenagoras</a>, <a href="../fathers/0205.htm"><em>A Plea for the Christians</em> 10-18</a>; Theophilus, "Ad Autolyc.", II, x; <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, "Adv. Prax.", vii). Their <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> is less satisfactory as regards the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of this generation and its necessity; in fact, they represent the Word as uttered by the Father when the Father wished to create and in view of this creation (<a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a>, "II Apol.", 6; cf. <a href="../fathers/01285.htm"><em>Dialogue with Trypho</em> 61-62</a>; <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, "Or.", v, a corrupt and <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> text; <a href="../cathen/02042b.htm">Athenagoras</a>, <a href="../fathers/0205.htm"><em>A Plea for the Christians</em> 10</a>; Theophilus, "Ad Autolyc.", II, xxii; <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, "Adv. Prax.", v-vii). When we seek to understand what they meant by this "utterance", it is difficult to give the same answer for all <a href="../cathen/02042b.htm">Athenagoras</a> seems to mean the role of the Son in the work of creation, the <em>syncatabasis</em> of the Nicene Fathers (Newman, "Causes of the Rise and Successes of Arianism" in "Tracts Theological and Ecclesiastical", London, 1902, 238), others, especially Theophilus and <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>, <a href="../fathers/0511.htm"><em>On the Holy Trinity</em> 31</a>), seem quite certainly to understand this "utterance" as properly so called. Mental survivals of <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a> seem to be responsible for this attitude: the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the Portico distinguished between the innate word (<em>endiathetos</em>) and the uttered word (<em>prophorikos</em>) bearing in mind this distinction the aforesaid apologists conceived a development in the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> after the same fashion. After this period, St. Iren&aelig;us condemned very severely these attempts at <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> explanation (<a href="../fathers/0103213.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> II.13.3-10</a>, cf. <a href="../fathers/0103228.htm">II.28.4-6</a>), and later Fathers rejected this unfortunate distinction between the Word <em>endiathetos</em> and <em>prophorikos</em> [<a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> (?), "Expos.

Council of <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a>, can. viii, in Athan., "De Synod.", 27-P.G., XXVI.

<p>As to the Divine Nature of the Word, all apologists are agreed but to some of them, at least to <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> and Tertuilian, there seemed to be in this Divinity a certain subordination (<a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a>, "I Apol.", 13-cf. "II Apol.", 13; <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, "Adv. Prax.", 9, 14, 26).

<p>The Alexandrian <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, themselves profound students of the Logos <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, avoided the above mentioned <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> concerning the dual conception of the Word (see, however, a fragment of the "Hypotyposes", of <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, cited by Photius, in P.G., CIII, 384, and Zahn, "Forschungen zur Geschichte des neutest. Kanons", Erlangen, 1884, xiii 144) and the generation in time; for Clement and for <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> the Word is eternal like the Father (Clement, <a href="../fathers/02107.htm"><em>Stromata</em> VII.1-2</a>, and "Adumbrat. in Joan.", i, 1, in P.G., IX, 734; <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="../fathers/04121.htm"><em>De Principiis</em> I.22.2 sqq.</a>; "In Jer. Hom.", IX, 4, in P.G., XIII, 357, "In Jo. ', ii, 32, in P.G., XIV, 77; cf. <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, "De decret. Nic. syn.", 27, in P.G., XXV, 465). As to the nature of the Word their teaching is less sure: in Clement, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, we find only a few traces of subordinationism (<a href="../fathers/02104.htm"><em>Stromata</em> IV.25</a>, <a href="../fathers/02107.htm">VII.3</a> and <a href="../fathers/02107.htm">VII.2</a>); elsewhere he very explicitly affirms the equality of the Father and the Son and the unity (" Protrept.", 10, in P.G., VIII 228, <a href="../fathers/02091.htm"><em>The Pedagogue</em> I.6</a>, <a href="../fathers/02091.htm">I.8-9</a> and <a href="../fathers/02093.htm">III.12</a>). <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, on the contrary, frequently and formally defended subordinationist <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> (<a href="../fathers/04121.htm"><em>De Principiis</em> I.3.5</a> and <a href="../fathers/04124.htm">IV.35</a>; "In Jo." ii, 2, in P.G., XIV, 108, 109; ii, 18, in P.G., XIV, 153, 156; vi, 23, in P.G., XIV, 268; xiii, 25, in P.G., XIV, 44144; xxxii, 18, in P.G., XIV, 817-20; "In Matt.", xv, 10, in P.G., XIII, 1280, 1281; "De Orat.", 15, in P.G., XI,464, <a href="../fathers/04165.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> V.11</a>); his teaching concerning the Word evidently suffered from Hellenic speculation: in the order of religious <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, the Word is for him an intermediary between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the creature.

<p>Amid these speculations of apologists and Alexandrian <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, elaborated not without danger or without <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> maintained her strict dogmatic teaching concerning the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This is particularly recognizable in the works of those Fathers more devoted to tradition than to philosophy, and especially in St. Iren&aelig;us, who condemns every form of the Hellenic and <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> theory of intermediary beings (Adv. Haer., II, xxx, 9; II, ii, 4; III, viii, 3; IV, vii, 4, IV, xx, 1), and who affirms in the strongest terms the full comprehension of the Father by the Son and their identity of nature (Adv. Haer., II, xvii, 8; IV, iv, 2, IV, vi, 3, 6). We find it again with still greater authority in the letter of Pope St. Dionysius to his namesake, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> (see Athan., "De decret. Nic. syn.", 26, in P.G., XXV, 461-65): "They lie as to the generation of the Lord who dare to say that His Divine and ineffable generation is a creation. We must not divide the admirable and Divine unity into three divinities, we must not lower the dignity and sovereign grandeur of the Lord by the word creation, but we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father omnipotent</a>, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> His Son, and in the Holy Ghost, we must unite the Word to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, for He has said: 'I and the Father are one', and again: 'I am in the Father, and the Father in me'. Thus we protect the Divine Trinity, and the holy avowal of the monarchy [unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>]." The <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> (325) had but to lend official <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> to this dogmatic teaching.
<h2 id="section5">Analogy between the divine word and human speech</h2>

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a>, all danger of Subordinationism being removed, it was possible to seek in the analogy of human speech some light on the mystery of the Divine generation; the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> especially refer to this analogy, in order to explain how this generation is purely spiritual and entails neither diminution nor change: <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a> (Athan., "De Sent. Dion.", 23, in P.G., XXV, 513); <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> ("De decret. Nic. syn.", 11, in P.G., XXV, 444); Basil ("In illud: In principio erat Verbum", 3, in P.G., XXXI, 476-77); <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzus</a> ("Or.", xxx,20, in P.G., XXXVI, 128-29) <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">Cyril of Alexandria</a> (" Thes." iv, in P.G., LXXV, 56; cf. 76, 80; xvi, ibid., 300; xvi, ibid., 313; "De Trinit.", dial. ii, in P.G., LXXV, 768 69), John Damasc. ("De Fide Orthod.", I, vi, in P.G., XCIV, 804).

<p><a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> studied more closely this analogy between the Divine Word and human speech (see especially <a href="../fathers/130109.htm"><em>On the Holy Trinity</em> IX.7.12 sq.</a> and <a href="../fathers/130115.htm">XV.10.17 sq.</a>), and drew from it teachings long accepted in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. He compares the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not to the word spoken by the lips, but to the interior speech of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whereby we may in some measure grasp the Divine mystery; engendered by the mind it remains therein, is equal thereto, is the source of its operations. This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was later developed and enriched by <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, especially in "Contra Gent.", IV, xi-xiv, opusc. "De natura verbi intellectus"; "Quaest. disput. de verit." iv, "De potent.", ii-viii, 1, "Summa Theol.", I-I, xxvii, 2; xxxiv. St. Thomas sets forth in a very clear way the identity of meaning, already noted by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (<a href="../fathers/130107.htm"><em>On the Holy Trinity</em> VII.2.3</a>), between the terms <em>Son</em> and <em>Word</em>: "eo Filius quo Verbum, et eo Verbum quo Filius" ("Summa Theol.", I-I, xxvii, 2, "Contra Gent.", IV, xi). The teaching of St. Thomas has been highly approved by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> especially in the condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/12116c.htm">Synod of Pistoia</a> by <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Enchiridion", 1460). (<em>See</em> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">JESUS CHRIST</a>; <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">TRINITY</a>.)
