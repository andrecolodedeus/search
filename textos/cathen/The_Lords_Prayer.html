<h1>The Lord's Prayer</h1>  

<p>Although the Latin term <em>oratio dominica</em> is of early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, the phrase "Lord's Prayer" does not seem to have been generally familiar in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the "Our Father" was always said in Latin, even by the uneducated. Hence it was then most commonly known as the <em>Pater noster</em>. The name "Lord's prayer" attaches to it not because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> used the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> Himself (for to ask forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would have implied the acknowledgment of guilt) but because He taught it to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.

<p>Many points of interest are suggested by the history and employment of the Our Father. With regard to the English text now in use among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, we may note that this is derived not from the <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Rheims Testament</a> but from a version imposed upon <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in the reign of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, and employed in the 1549 and 1552 editions of the <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">"Book of Common Prayer"</a>. From this our present <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> text differs only in two very slight particulars: "Which art" has been modernized into "who art", and "in earth" into "on earth".

<p>The version itself, which accords pretty closely with the translation in Tyndale's <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, no doubt owed its general acceptance to an ordinance of 1541 according to which "his Grace perceiving now the great diversity of the translations (of the Pater noster etc.) hath willed them all to be taken up, and instead of them hath <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> an uniform translation of the said Pater noster, Ave, <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a>, etc. to be set forth, willing all his loving subjects to learn and use the same and straitly commanding all parsons, <a href="../cathen/15401a.htm">vicars</a> and <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curates</a> to read and teach the same to their parishioners". As a result the version in question became universally familiar to the nation, and though the Rheims Testament, in 1581, and <a href="../cathen/02141a.htm">King James's translators</a>, in 1611, provided somewhat different renderings of <a href="../bible/mat006.htm#vrs9">Matthew 6:9-13</a>, the older form was retained for their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> both by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> alike.

<p>As for the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> itself the version in <a href="../bible/luk011.htm#vrs2">St. Luke 11:2-4</a>, given by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in answer to the request of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, differs in some minor details from the form which <a href="../bible/mat006.htm#vrs9">St. Matthew (6:9-15)</a> introduces in the middle of the Sermon on the Mount, but there is clearly no reason why these two occasions should be regarded as identical. It would be almost inevitable that if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had taught this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> He should have repeated it more than once. It seems probable, from the form in which the Our Father appears in the "Didache", that the version in <a href="../cathen/10056b.htm">St. Matthew</a> was that which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> adopted from the beginning for <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> purposes. Again, no great importance can be attached to the resemblances which have been traced between the petitions of the Lord's prayer and those found in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of Jewish origin which were current about the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. There is certainly no reason for treating the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> formula as a plagiarism, for in the first place the resemblances are but partial and, secondly we have no satisfactory evidence that the Jewish <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were really anterior in <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>.

<p>Upon the interpretation of the Lord's Prayer, much has been written, despite the fact that it is so plainly simple, natural, and spontaneous, and as such preeminently adapted for popular use. In the quasi-official "Catechismus ad parochos", drawn up in 1564 in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, an elaborate commentary upon the Lord's Prayer is provided which forms the basis of the <a href="../cathen/01450a.htm">analysis</a> of the Our Father found in all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> catechisms. Many points worthy of notice are there emphasized, as, for example, the fact that the words "On earth as it is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>" should be understood to qualify not only the petition "Thy will be done", but also the two preceding, "hallowed be Thy <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">name</a>" and "Thy Kingdom come". The meaning of this last petition is also very fully dealt with. The most conspicuous difficulty in the original text of the Our Father concerns the interpretation of the words <em>artos epiousios</em> which in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> in St. Luke we translate "our daily bread", <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, by a strange inconsistency, changed the pre-existing word <em>quotidianum</em> into <em>supersubstantialem</em> in <a href="../cathen/10056b.htm">St. Matthew</a> but left <em>quotidianum</em> in St. Luke. The opinion of modern scholars upon the point is sufficiently indicated by the fact that the Revised Version still prints "daily" in the text, but suggests in the margin "our bread for the coming day", while the American Committee wished to add "our needful bread". Lastly may be noted the generally received opinion that the rendering of the last clause should be "deliver us from the evil one", a change which justifies the use of "but" in stead of "and" and practically converts the two last clauses into one and the same petition. The <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm">doxology</a> "for Thine is the Kingdom", etc., which appears in the Greek <em>textus receptus</em> and has been adopted in the later editions of the "Book of Common Prayer", is undoubtedly an interpolation.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the Our Father holds a very conspicuous place. Some commentators have <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> supposed, from a passage in the writings of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> (Ep., ix, 12), that he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that the bread and wine of the Eucharist were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> times by the recitation of the Our Father alone. But while this is probably not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> meaning of the passage, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> asserted (Adv. Pelag., iii, 15) that "our Lord Himself taught His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that daily in the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of His Body</a> they should make bold to say 'Our Father' etc." <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> gave the Pater its present place in the Roman Mass immediately after the Canon and before the fraction, and it was of old the <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> that all the congregation should make answer in the words "Sed libera nos a malo". In the Greek <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> a reader recites the Our Father aloud while the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and the people repeat it silently. Again in the ritual of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the recitation of the Our Father has from the earliest times been a conspicuous feature, and in the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> it recurs repeatedly besides being recited both at the beginning and the end.

<p>In many <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> rules, it was enjoined that the <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no Latin, instead of the Divine office should say the Lord's Prayer a certain number of times (often amounting to more than a hundred) <em>per diem</em>. To count these repetitions they made use of pebbles or <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a> strung upon a cord, and this apparatus was commonly known as a "pater-noster", a name which it retained even when such a string of <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a> was used to count, not Our Fathers, but Hail Marys in reciting <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Our Lady's Psalter</a>, or in other words in saying the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">rosary</a>.
