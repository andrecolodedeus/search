<h1>The Martyrs of Gorkum</h1>  

<p>The year 1572, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> had already wrested from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> a great part of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The iconoclastic storm had swept through the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, and was followed by a struggle between <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> and <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> in which the latter was victorious. In 1571 the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> held their first synod, at Embden. On 1 April of the next year the <em>Watergeuzen</em> (Sea-beggars) conquered Briel and later Vlissingen and other places. In June, Dortrecht and Gorkum fell into their hands and at Gorkum they captured nine Franciscans. These were: <a href="../cathen/11065b.htm">Nicholas Pieck</a>, guardian of Gorkum, Hieronymns of Weert, vicar, Theodorus van der Eem, of Amersfoort, Nicasius Janssen, of Heeze, Willehad of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, Godefried of Mervel, Antonius of Weert, Antonius of Hoornaer, and Franciseus de Roye, of <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>. To these were added two <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> from the same <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, Petrus of Assche and Cornelius of Wyk near Duurstede. Almost at the same time the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> laid their hands on the learned <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Gorkum, Leonardus Vechel of <a href="../cathen/02625b.htm">Bois-le-Duc</a>, who had made distinguished studies in <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, and also has assistant Nicolaas Janssen, surnamed Poppel, of Welde in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. With the above, were also <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> Godefried van Duynsen, of Gorkum who was active as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in his native city, and Joannes Lenartz of Oisterwljk, an Augustinian and director of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Augustinian <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> in Gorkum. To these fifteen, who from the very first underwent all the sufferings and torments of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, were later added four more companions: Joannes van Hoornaer, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> of the Cologne province and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> not far from Gorkum, who, when apprised of the incarceration of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Gorkum, hastened to the city in order to administer the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to them and was seized and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> with the rest, Jacobus Lacops of Oudenaar, a <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a>, who after leading a frivolous life, being disobedient to his order, and neglectful of his religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, reformed, became a <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> in Monster, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in 1572; Adrianus Janssen of Hilvarenbeek, at one time a <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in Monster, who was sent to Brielle with Jacobus Lacops; and lastly Andreas Wouters of Heynoord, whose conduct was not edifying up to the time of his arrest, but who made ample amends by his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.

<p>After enduring much suffering and abuse in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> at Gorkum (26 June-6 July) the first fifteen <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were transferred to Brielle. On their way to Dortrecht they were exhibited for money to the curious and arrived at Brielle 13 July. On the following day, Lumey, the commander of the <em>Watergeuzen</em>, caused the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> to be interrogated and ordered a sort of disputation. In the meantime the four other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> also arrived. It was exacted of each that he abandon his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> and in <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> supremacy. All remained firm in their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Meanwhile there came a letter from William of Orange which enjoined all those in authority to leave <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and religious unmolested. Nevertheless Lumey caused the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> to be hanged in the night of 9 July, in a turfshed amid cruel mutilations. Their <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> took place on 14 Nov., 1675, and their <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> on 29 June, 1865. For many years the place of their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in Brielle has been the scene of numerous <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> and processions.
