<div id="springfield2">
<h1>The Military Orders</h1>  

<p>Including under this term every kind of brotherhood of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, secular as well as religious, historians of the military orders have enumerated as many as a hundred, even after eliminating the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> and stillborn. This great number is explained by the eagerness with which the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> welcomed an institution so thoroughly corresponding to the two occupations of that period, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and religion. Royalty afterwards utilized this new <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> to strengthen its own position or to reward faithful nobles, creating secular orders of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knighthood</a> until there was no country without its royal or princely order.
<h2>Apocryphal military orders</h2>

<p>Even private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> entered into the business; adventurers attempted to exploit the vanity of the <em>noblesse</em> by sham insignia of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knighthood</a> with which they decked themselves, and which they distributed among their dupes lavishly &#151; though not gratuitously. Hence came a whole category of orders justly considered <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>.

<p>In the seventeenth century Marino Caraccioli (1624), a <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> nobleman, succeeded in passing himself off as Grand Master of the <a href="../cathen/13350a.htm">Order of Knights of St. George</a>, which he pretended to trace to <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great.</a>

<p>In 1632, Balthasar Giron, who called himself an <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a>, brought to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> an order no less ancient, that of St. Anthony of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, an imposture almost immediately unmasked by another Oriental, the learned <a href="../cathen/01057a.htm">Abraham Echelensis</a> (1646).

<p>At the court of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> &#151; brought to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> from the Gold Coast &#151; posed as a prince, even securing the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptised</a> by <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> (1686), and instituted the Order of the Star of Our Lady before returning to his alleged dominions.
<h2>Stillborn military orders</h2>

<p>A regular order of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knighthood</a> means a brotherhood or confraternity which combines with the insignia of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knighthood</a> the privileges of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. This supposes recognition on the part of both <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>; to belong to the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, they needed the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> confirmation; they could not wear the sword of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knighthood</a> without the authorization of the prince. Orders of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knighthood</a> lacking this official recognition should be expunged from history, even though they figure in the pages of all the old historians of the military orders. As a matter of fact, more than one rule of this kind, scarcely passing beyond the initial stages, has existed, and such are the orders which may be designated <em>stillborn.</em>

<p>No trace is to be found in the "Bullarium romanum" of the order called the <a href="../cathen/10272a.htm">Wing of St. Michael</a>, attributed to King Alfonso I of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> (1176), nor of the Order of the Ship, which <a href="../cathen/09368a.htm">St. Louis</a> was supposed to have founded on the eve of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> to <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a> where he died (1270), nor of that of the Argonauts of St. Nicholas, attributed to Charles III, King of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, 1382.

<p>Philippe de Mezi&egrave;res, chancellor of the King of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, drew up the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of an Order of the Passion of Christ (1360) the text of which has recently been published, but which were never enforced.

<p>After the conquest of Lemnos from the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pope Pius II</a> founded an order of Our Lady of Bethlehem, intending to transfer to it the possessions of older orders which no longer fulfilled their purpose (1459), but the loss of the island prevented its institution. The same fate befell the German Order of the Christian Militia, projected (1615) under <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>; the Order of the French order of The Magdalen for the suppression of <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duelling</a> (1614); and the Order of the Conception of Our Lady, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of which, drawn up by the Duke of <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a> and approved by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> (1623) have remained a dead letter.
<h2>Genuine military orders</h2>

<p>The age of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a> had passed. The orders of any historical existence may be reduced to three categories: (a) The Greater Regular Orders; (b) The Lesser Regular Orders; (c) The Secular Orders.
<h3>The greater regular orders</h3>

<p><a href="../images/10304dbx.jpg"><img alt="Image" align=left src="../images/10304dbt.jpg"></a>

<p>The great military orders had their origin in the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a>, from which they retain the common badge of every order of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knighthood</a> &#151; the cross worn on the breast.

<p><em>Military Orders</em>

<p>The oldest of these, the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Knights Templar.</a>, has served as a model for all the others. After barely a century of existence, they were suppressed by <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>; but two remnants remained after the fourteenth century, the Order of Christ in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10534a.htm">Order of Montesa</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In the twelfth century <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> had borrowed their rule from the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> and founded the Portuguese <a href="../cathen/02161d.htm">Order of Aviz</a>. Almost at the same time there arose in Castile the Order of Calatrava and in Leon the Order of Alcantara.

<p><em>Military/Hospitaller Orders</em>

<p>Contemporary with these purely military orders, others were founded at once military and hospitaller, the most famous of which were the <a href="../cathen/07477a.htm">Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem</a> (Knights of Malta) and the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a> (modelled on the former), both still in existence. In the same category should be included the Order of Santiago which spread throughout Castile, <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>.

<p><em>Hospitaller Orders</em>

<p>Lastly, there are the purely hospitaller orders whose commanders, however, claimed the rank of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> though they had never been in battle, such as the Orders of <a href="../cathen/09096b.htm">St. Lazarus of Jerusalem</a> and of the Holy Spirit of <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a>. With these may be connected the <a href="../cathen/10197b.htm">Order of Our Lady of Ransom</a> (<em>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Merced</em>, also called <a href="../cathen/10197b.htm">Mercedarians</a>), founded (1218) in <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> by <a href="../cathen/11770b.htm">St. Peter Nolasco</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of captives. Including religious <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> as well as religious <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, it was originally considered a military order, but dissensions arose and each rank chose its own grand master. <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> (1317) reserved the grand-mastership to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, with the result of a general exodus of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> into the newly founded military <a href="../cathen/10534a.htm">Order of Montesa</a>.


<h3>The lesser regular orders</h3>

<p>There is mention in the twelfth century, in Castile, of an Order of Montjoie, confirmed by <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> (1180), but difficult to distinguish from the Order of Calatrava, with which it was soon amalgamated.

<p>In 1191, after the siege of Acre, <a href="../cathen/13041b.htm">Richard I of England</a> founded there in fulfilment of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, the Order of <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas of Canterbury</a>, an order of hospitallers for the service of English <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. It seems to have been made dependent on the <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> of St. John, whom it followed to <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> after the evacuation of Palestine. Its existence is attested by the Bullarium of <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> and <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>; beyond this it has left but little trace except a church of remarkable architecture, St. Nicholas, at <a href="../cathen/11071c.htm">Nicosia</a> in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>.

<p><a href="../images/10304dax.jpg"><img alt="Image" align=left src="../images/10304dat.jpg"></a>

<p>Better known is the history of the Schwertzbr&uuml;der (<em>Ensiferi</em>, or Swordbearers) of Livonia, founded by Albert, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Riga (1197), to propagate the Faith in the Baltic Provinces and to protect the new <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> there against the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> nations still numerous in that part of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Against these <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> had been preached; but, the temporary <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> having made haste to withdraw, it became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, as in Palestine, to supply their place with a permanent order. This order adopted the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, the white mantle and the red cross of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a>, with a red sword as their distinctive badge, whence their name of <em>Ensiferi.</em> The order was approved in 1202 by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>. Thrown open to all sorts of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> without distinction of birth, overrun by aimless adventurers whose excesses were calculated rather to exasperate the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> than to convert them, it endured but a short time, having only two grand masters, the first of whom, Vinnon, was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> by one of his fellows in 1209, while the second, Volquin, fell on the field of battle in 1236, with four hundred and eighty <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> of the order. The survivors petitioned to be allowed to enter the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a>, of which the Knights of Livonia thenceforward formed one branch under a provincial master of their own (1238). Their possessions, acquired by conquest, formed a principality under <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> (1525), and the last of their masters, Gottart Kettler, <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a> and converted it into the hereditary Duchy of Courland under the suzerainty of the kings of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> (1562).

<p>The Gaudenti of Our Lady at Bologna, confirmed by <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> in 1262, and suppressed by <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> in 1589, were not so much a military order as an association of gentlemen who undertook to maintain the public peace in those turbulent times.

<p>An order of St. George of Alfama, in <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, approved in 1363 by <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban V</a>, was merged in the <a href="../cathen/10534a.htm">Order of Montesa</a> in 1399.

<p>The Knights of St. George, in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, founded by the Emperor Frederick III, and approved by <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a> in 1468, failing to perpetuate their existence, owing to the lack of territorial possessions, gave place to a purely secular confraternity.

<p>The Order of St. Stephen Pope was founded in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> by the Grand Duke Cosmo I and approved in 1561 by <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, being placed under the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Benedictine Rule.</a> It had its principal house at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to equip a certain number of galleys to fight the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in the Mediterranean after the manner of, and in concert with, the "caravans" of the <a href="../cathen/07477a.htm">Knights of Malta</a>.
<h3>The secular orders</h3>

<p>Dating from the fourteenth century, fraternities of lay <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> were formed modelled on the great regular orders; as in the latter, we find in these secular orders a patron, a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to serve the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the sovereign, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, a grand master (usually the reigning prince), and the practice of certain devotions. Most of them also asked for the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, which, on the other hand, granted them spiritual favours &#151; <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, the privilege of private <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>, <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from certain <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, etc.

<p>The chief of these orders are as follows:

<p><em>England</em>

<p>In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/05321a.htm">Edward III</a>, in memory of the legendary Knights of the Round Table, established in 1349 brotherhood of twenty-five <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, exclusive of princes of the blood and foreign princes, with St. George as its patron and with its <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in Windsor Castle for the holding of chapters. This, the Order of the Garter, takes its name from the characteristic badge, won on the left knee. The choice of this badge has given rise to various anecdotes of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> authenticity. Nothing is now known of the original object of the Order of the Bath, the creation of which dates from the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of Henry IV (1399). A third order, Scottish by origin, is that of the Order of the Thistle, dating from the reign of James V of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> (1534). These orders still exist, though they have been <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">protestantized.</a>

<p><em>France</em>

<p>In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the royal orders of the Star, dating from John the Good (1352), <a href="../cathen/10272a.htm">of St. Michael</a>, founded by Louis XI (1469), of the Holy Ghost, founded by Henry III (1570), of Our Lady of Carmel, amalgamated by Henry IV with that of St. Lazarus were absolutely suppressed by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>.

<p><em>Austria and Spain</em>

<p>Austria and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> now dispute the inheritance from the House of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to confer the Order of the Golden Fleece, founded by Duke Philip the Good, approved by <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> in 1433, and extended by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> in 1516.

<p><em>Piedmont</em>

<p>In <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, the Order of the Annunziata, under its later form, dates only from Charles III, Duke of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, in 1518, but its first dedication to the Blessed Virgin goes back to Amadeus VIII, first Duke of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> under the name of <a href="../cathen/06031b.htm">Felix V</a> (1434). There had, previously to this dedication, existed in <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> an Order of the Collar, which held its chapters in the Charterhouse (founded in 1892) of Pierre-Ch&acirc;tel in Bugey. Here also the Knights of the Annunziata kept their <a href="../cathen/01542a.htm">feast of the Annunciation</a>, so that they have considered themselves as successors of the Order of the Collar. After the cession of Bugey to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, they transferred their chapters to the newly founded <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the Mountain of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> (1627).

<p><em>Mantua</em>

<p>In the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, Duke Vincent Gonzaga, on the marriage of his son Francis II, instituted, with the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>, the Knights of the Precious Blood, a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of which is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in that capital.

<p><em>Pontifical Secular Orders</em>

<p>Lastly there are a number of pontifical secular orders, the oldest of which is the Order of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, contemporary with the institution of the same order in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> in 1319. In approving the latter institution, <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> reserved the right of creating a certain number of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> by patent, and it is now used to reward services rendered by any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whatsoever without distinction of birth.

<p>The same is to be said of the Order of St. Peter, instituted by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> in 1520, of the Order of St. Paul, founded by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> in 1534, and of Our Lady of Loretto, charged by <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> in 1558, to watch over and preserve that sanctuary. These distinctions were mostly granted to functionaries of the pontifical chancery.

<p>There has been some question as to the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, formerly dependent on the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and reorganized by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pope Pius X</a>. The Knights of St. Catherine of Sinai are not an order, either secular or regular.
<h2>General organization of the orders</h2>

<p>The respective particular histories of the great military orders have been traced in the various articles devoted to them; it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> here only to explain their general organization, religious, military, and <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a>.
<h3>Religious state</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> of the great orders were regarded in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as analogous to <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> whose three <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> they professed and whose <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a> they shared. They were answerable to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> alone; they had their <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and their <a href="../cathen/03504a.htm">cemeteries</a>, all exempted from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. Their landed <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was free from <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>. They were not subject to the <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdicts</a> which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in those days employed so freely. They did not all follow the same monastic rule. The <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> and orders derived from them followed the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian Reform.</a> The <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> followed the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine.</a> Nevertheless, in consequence of the relaxation which manifested itself among them after the period of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> introduced mitigations in favour of the <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">non-clerical brethren</a>. For these it was difficult to maintain the <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">rule of celibacy</a> in all its rigour; they were permitted, in certain orders, to marry once, and that only with a maiden. Even where second marriages were tolerated, they had to <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> conjugal fidelity, so that if they violated this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> doubly against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and against their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Besides the three <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, the rule bound the brethren to the exercises of the monastic life such as the recitation of the Hours, for which, in the case of illiterates, a fixed number of Paters was substituted. It also prescribed their dress and their food, and their feast, abstinence, and fast days. Lastly, the rule imposed detailed <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> in regard to the election of dignitaries and the admission of members to the two ranks of combatants &#151; <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> and men-at-arms &#151; and the two of non-combatants &#151; <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, to whom all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> functions were reserved, and <em>casaliers</em>, or tenants, who were charged with the management of temporal affairs.
<h3>Military organizations</h3>

<p>The military organization of the orders was uniform, explained by that law of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which compels the belligerent to maintain his military apparatus on a level with those of his adversary, on pain of defeat. The strength of an army was in its cavalry, and to this type the armament, mounting, and tactics of the military orders conformed. The <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights-brethren</a> were the heavy cavalry; the men-at-arms-brethren, the light cavalry. The former were entitled to three horses a piece; the latter had to be content with one. Among the former, only <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> of tried prowess were admitted, or, in default of this qualification, sons of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, because in such <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> the warlike spirit and military training were hereditary. The consequence was that the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, properly so-called, were never very numerous; they formed a <em>corps d'&eacute;lite</em> which carried the great mass of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>. Gathered in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> which were also barracks, combining with the passive obedience of the soldier, the spontaneous submission of the religious, living shoulder to shoulder in brotherly union, commander and subordinate, these orders surpassed, in that cohesiveness which is the ideal of every military organization, the most famous bodies of picked soldiery known to history, from the Macedonian phalanx to the Ottoman Janissaries.
<h3>Economic oganization</h3>

<p>The importance acquired by the military orders during the course of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> may be measured by the extent of their territorial possessions, scattered throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. In the thirteenth century nine thousand manors formed the portion of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a>; thirteen thousand that of the <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a>. These temporalities were an integral part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> domain, and as such had a sacred character which placed them beyond liability to profane uses or to secular imposts. They differed from the temporalities of other monastic institutions only in the centralized system of their administration. While within each of the other religious institutes every <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was autonomous, all the houses of a military order were bound to contribute their revenues, after deducting expenses, to a central treasury. As a result of this enormous circulation of capital controlled by the orders, their wealth could be applied to financial operations which made them veritable credit and deposit banks. Their perfect <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a> earned for them the implicit confidence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and of temporal rulers. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> employed them to collect contributions for the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a>; princes did not hesitate to entrust to them their personal <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. In this respect, again, the military orders were model institutions.
