<h1>The Name of Mary</h1>  

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a> is the mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> form of her name is <em>miryam</em> denoting in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> only the sister of Moses. In <a href="../bible/1ch004.htm#vrs17">1 Chronicles 4:17</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretic</a> text applies the same name to a son of Jalon, but, as the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint version</a> transcribes this name as <em>Maron</em>, we must infer that the orthography of the Hebrew text has been altered by the transcribers. The same version renders <em>miryam</em> by <em>Marian</em>, a form analogous to the Syriac and Aramaic word <em>Maryam.</em> In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> the name of the Virgin Mary is always <em>Mariam</em>, excepting in the <a href="../cathen/04086a.htm">Vatican Codex</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04083a.htm">Codex Bezae</a> followed by a few critics who read <em>Maria</em> in <a href="../bible/luk002.htm#vrs19">Luke 2:19</a>. Possibly the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> kept the archaic form of the name for the Blessed Virgin, so as to distinguish her from the other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who bore the same name. The <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> renders the name by Maria, both in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> and the New; <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (Ant. Jud., II, ix, 4) changes the name to <em>Mariamme</em>.

<p>It is antecedently probable that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should have chosen for Mary a name suitable to her high dignity. What has been said about the form of the name <em>Mary</em> shows that for its meaning we must investigate the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> form <em>miryam</em>. Bardenhewer has published a most satisfactory monograph on the subject, in which he explains and discusses about seventy different meanings of the name <em>miryam</em> (Der Name Maria. Geschichte der Deutung desselben. Freiburg, 1895); we shall be able to give only an outline of his work. Fr. von Hummelauer (in Exod. et Levit., Paris, 1897, p. 161) mentions the possibility that <em>miryam</em> may be of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> origin. Moses, Aaron, and their sister were born in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; the name <em>Aaron</em> cannot be explained from the Hebrew; the daughter of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> imposed the name <em>Moses</em> on the child she had saved from the waters of the Nile; hence it is possible that their sister's name Mary was also of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> origin. This seems to become even probable if we consider the fact that the name Mary was not borne by any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> excepting the sister of Moses. But the question why was not the name Mary more common in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, if it was of <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> origin, is answered by another question, why was the name Mary chosen by the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Blessed Lady</a> and by a number of others mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, if the word was <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>? Though the meaning of Mary as derived from the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <em>Mery, Meryt</em> (cherished, beloved), is most suitable for an only daughter, such a derivation is only possible, or at best barely probable.

<p>Most interpreters derive the name Mary from the Hebrew, considering it either as a compound word or as a simple. <em>Miryam</em> has been regarded as composed as a noun and a pronominal suffix, or of a noun and an adjective, or again of two nouns. Gesenius was the first to consider <em>miryam</em> as a compound of the noun <em>meri</em> and the pronominal suffix <em>am</em>; this word actually occurs in II Esd., ix, 17, meaning "their rebellion". But such an expression is not a suitable name for a young girl. Gesenius himself abandoned this explanation, but it was adopted by some of his followers, e.g. by J. Grimm (Das Leben Jesu; sec. edit., I, 414-431, Regensburg, 1890) and Schanz (Comment. uber d. Ev. d. hl. Matth&auml;us, p. 78, Freiburg, 1879). One of the meanings assigned to the name Mary in <a href="../cathen/09722b.htm">Martianay's</a> edition of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> works (S. Hier. opp., t. II, Parisiis, 1699, 2&#176;, cols. 109-170, 181-246, 245-270) is <em>pikra thalassa</em>, <em>bitter sea.</em> Owing to the corrupt condition in which <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> found the "Onomastica" of Philo and of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, which he in a way re-edited, it is hard to say whether the interpretation "bitter sea" is really due to either of these two authorities; at any rate, it is based on the assumption that the name <em>miryam</em> is composed of the Hebrew words <em>mar</em> (bitter) and <em>yam</em> (sea). Since in Hebrew the adjective follows its substantive, the compound of the two words ought to read <em>yam mar</em>; and even if the inverse order of words be admitted as possible, we have at best <em>maryam</em>, not <em>miryam</em>. Those who consider <em>miryam</em> as a compound word usually explain it as consisting of two nouns: <em>mor</em> and <em>yam</em> (myrrh of the sea); <em>mari</em> (cf. <a href="../bible/dan004.htm#vrs16">Daniel 4:16</a>) and <em>yam</em> (mistress of the sea); <em>mar</em> (cf. <a href="../bible/isa040.htm#vrs15">Isaiah 40:15</a>) and <em>yam</em> (drop of the sea). But these and all similar derivations of the name Mary are philogically inadmissible, and of little use to the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>. This is notably <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the explanation <em>photizousa autous</em>, enlightening them, whether it be based on the identification of <em>miryam</em> with <em>me'iram</em> (part. Hiphil of <em>'or</em> with pronominal suffix of 3 plur.), or with <em>mar'am</em> (part. Hiphil of <em>ra'ah</em> with pron. suffix of 3 plur.), or again with <em>mar'eya</em> (part. Hiphil of <em>raah</em> with Aramaic fem. termination <em>ya</em>; cf. Knabenbauer, Evang. sec. Matt., pars prior, Parisiis, 1892, p. 43).

<p>Here a word has to be added concerning the explanation <em>stella maris</em>, star of the sea. It is more popular than any other interpretation of the name Mary, and is dated back to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (De nomin. hebraic., de Exod., de Matth., P.L., XXIII, col, 789, 842). But the great <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctor of the Church</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Hebrew too well to translate the first syllable of the name <em>miryam</em> by star; in <a href="../bible/isa040.htm#vrs15">Isaiah 40:15</a>, he renders the word <em>mar</em> by <em>stilla</em> (drop), not <em>stella</em> (star). A Bamberg <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the end of the ninth century reads <em>stilla maris</em> instead of <em>stella maris.</em> Since Varro, Quintillian, and Aulus Gelliius testify that the Latin peasantry often substituted an e for an i, reading <em>vea</em> for <em>via</em>, <em>vella</em> for <em>villa</em>, <em>speca</em> for <em>spica</em>, etc., the substitution of <em>maris stella</em> for <em>maris stilla</em> is easily explained. Neither an appeal to the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Minur-juma (cf. Zeitschr. f. kathol. Theol., IV, 1880, p. 389) nor the suggestion that <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> may have regarded <em>miryam</em> as a contracted form of <em>me'or yam</em> (cf. Schegg, Jacobus der Bruder des Herrn, Munchen, 1882, p. 56 Anm.) will account for his supposed interpretation <em>stella maris</em> (star of the sea) instead of <em>stilla maris</em> (a drop of the sea).

<p>It was Hiller (Onomasticum sacrum, T&uuml;bingen, 1706, pp. 170, 173, 876) who first gave a philological explanation of <em>miryam</em> as a simple word. The termination <em>am</em> is according to this writer a mere formative affix intensifying or amplifying the meaning of the noun. But practically <em>miryam</em> had been considered as a simple noun long before Hiller. Philo (De somn., II, 20; ed. Mangey, II, 677) is said to have explained the word as meaning <em>elpis</em> (hope), deriving the word either from <em>ra'ah</em> (to see, to expect?) or from <em>morash</em> (hope); but as Philo can hardly have seriously believed in such a hazardous derivation, he probably presented Mary the sister of Moses as a mere symbol of hope without maintaining that her very name meant hope. In Rabbinic literature <em>miryam</em> is explained as meaning <em>merum</em> (bitterness; cf. J. Levy, Neuhebraisches und chaldaisches W&ouml;rterbuch uber die Talmudim und Midraschim, Leipzig, 1876-89, s.v. <em>merum</em>); but such a meaning of the word is historically improbable, and the derivation of <em>miryam</em> from <em>marar</em> grammatically inadmissible. Other meanings assigned to <em>miryam</em> viewed as a simple word are: <em>bitter one, great sorrow</em> (from <em>marar</em> or <em>marah</em>; cf. Simonis, Onomasticum Veteris Testamenti, Halae Magdeburgicae, 1741, p. 360; Onom. Novi Test., ibid., 1762, p. 106); <em>rebellion</em> (from <em>meri</em>; cf. Gesenius, Thesaur. philol. critic. ling. hebr. et chald. Beter. Testamenti, edit. altera, Lipsiae, 1835-38, II, p. 819b); <em>healed one</em> (cf. Sch&auml;fer, Die Gottesmutter in der hl. Schrift, M&uuml;nster, 1887, pp. 135-144); <em>fat one, well nourished one</em> (from <em>mara</em>; cf. Schegg, Evangelium nach Matth&auml;us, Bd. I, M&uuml;nchen, 1856, p. 419; id., Jacobus der Bruder des Herrn, M&uuml;nchen, 1882, p. 56; Furst, Hebr. und chald. Hanw&ouml;rterb. &uuml;ber d. alte Test., Leipzig, 1857-1861, s.v. <em>miryam</em>); <em>mistress</em> (from <em>mari</em>; cf. v. Haneberg, Geschichte d. biblisch. Offenbarung, 4th edit., <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Regensburg</a>, 1876, p. 604); <em>strong one, ruling one</em> (from <em>marah</em>; cf. Bisping, Erkl&auml;rung d. Evang. nach Matth., M&uuml;nster, 1867, p. 42); <em>gracious or charming one</em> (from <em>ra'am</em> which word does not have this meaning in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>; cf. v. Haneberg, 1, c.); <em>myrrh</em> (from <em>mor</em>, though it does not appear how this word can be identified with <em>miryam</em>; cf. Knabenbauer, Evang. sec. Matth., pars prior, Parisiis, 1892, p. 44); <em>exalted one</em> (from <em>rum</em>; cf. Caninius, De locis S. Scripturae hebraicis comment., Antverpiae, 1600, pp. 63-64).

<p>In 1906 Zorrell advanced another explanation of the name Mary, based on its derivation from the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <em>mer</em> or <em>mar</em>, to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> Divine name <em>Yam</em> or <em><a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a></em> (Zeitschrift f&uuml;r katholische Theologie, 1906, pp. 356 sqq.). Thus explained the name denotes "one loving <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a>" or "one beloved by <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a>". We have already pointed out the difficulty implied in an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> origin of the name Mary. Probably it is safer to adhere to Bardenhewer's conclusions (l. c., pp. 154 sq.): <em>Mariam</em> and <em>Maria</em> are the later forms of the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>miryam</em>; <em>miryam</em> is not a compound word consisting of two nouns, or a noun and an adjective, or a noun and a pronominal suffix, but it is a simple though derivative noun; the noun is not formed by means of a prefix (<em>m</em>), but by the addition of a suffix (<em>am</em>). Presupposing these principles, the name <em>miryam</em> may be derived either from <em>marah</em>, to be rebellious, or from <em>mara</em>, to be well nourished. Etymology does not decide which of these derivations is to be preferred; but it is hardly probable that the name of a young girl should be connected with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of rebellion, while Orientals consider the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of being well nourished as synonymous with beauty and bodily perfection, so that they would be apt to give their daughters a name derived from <em>mara</em> Mary means therefore <em>The beautiful</em> or <em>The perfect one.</em>
