<h2 id="i">As known through natural reason ("the God of the philosophers")</h2>

<p>Having established by <a href="../cathen/07779a.htm">inductive</a> inference the self-existence of a personal First Cause distinct from matter and from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> (see <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">EXISTENCE OF GOD</a>), we now proceed by <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deductive</a> analysis to examine the nature and attributes of this Being to the extent required by our limited <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> scope. We will treat accordingly of <ul><li>the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, <li>unity or unicity, and <li>simplicity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, adding <li>some remarks on Divine <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>.</ul>

<h3 id="IA">Infinity of God</h3>

<p>When we say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, we mean that He is unlimited in every kind of perfection or that every conceivable perfection belongs to Him in the highest conceivable way. In a different sense we sometimes speak, for instance, of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> time or space, meaning thereby time of such indefinite duration or space of such indefinite extension that we cannot assign any fixed limit to one or the other. Care should be taken not to confound these two essentially different meanings of the term. Time and space, being made up of parts in duration or extension, are essentially finite by comparison with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>. Now we assert that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> perfect in the sense explained, and that His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> is deducible from His self-existence. For a self-existent being, if limited at all, could be limited only by itself; to be limited by another would imply causal dependence on that other, which the very notion of self-existence excludes. But the self-existing cannot be conceived as limiting itself, in the sense of curtailing its perfection of being, without ceasing to be self-existing. Whatever it is, it is necessarily; its own essence is the sole reason or explanation of its existence, so that its manner of existence must be as unchangeable as its essence, and to suggest the possibility of an increase or diminution of perfection would be to suggest the absurdity of a changeable essence. It only remains, then, to say that whatever perfection is compatible with its essence is actually realized in a self-existing being; but as there is no conceivable perfection as such &#151; that is, no expression of positive being as such &#151; that is not compatible with the essence of the self-existent, it follows that the self-existent must be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in all perfection. For self-existence itself is absolute positive being and positive being cannot contradict, and cannot therefore limit, positive being.

<p>This general, and admittedly very abstract, conclusion, as well as the reasoning which supports it, will be rendered more intelligible by a brief specific illustration of what it involves.

<p>(i) When, in speaking of the Infinite, we attribute all conceivable perfections to Him, we must not forget that the predicates we employ to describe perfections derive their meaning and connotation in the first instance from their application to finite beings; and on reflection it is seen that we must distinguish between different kinds of perfections, and that we cannot without palpable contradiction attribute all the perfections of creatures in the same way to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Some perfections are such that even in the abstract, they necessarily imply or connote finiteness of being or imperfection; while some others do not of themselves necessarily connote imperfection. To the first class belong all material perfections &#151; extension, sensibility and the like &#151; and certain spiritual perfections such as rationality (as distinct from simple intelligence); to the second class belong such perfections as being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, intelligence, wisdom, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, etc. Now while it cannot be said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> extended, or that He feels or reasons in an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> way, it can be said that He is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> good, intelligent, wise, just, holy, etc. &#151; in other words, while perfections of the second class are attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> formally (i.e., without any change in the proper meaning of the predicates which express them), those of the first class can only be attributed to Him eminently and equivalently, (i.e. whatever positive being they express belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as their cause in a much higher and more excellent way than to the creatures in which they formally exist). By means of this important distinction, which <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnostics</a> reject or neglect, we are able to think and to speak of the Infinite without being guilty of contradiction, and the fact that men generally &#151; even <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnostics</a> themselves when off their guard &#151; recognize and use the distinction, is the best <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that it is pertinent and well founded. Ultimately it is only another way of saying that, given an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> cause and finite effects, whatever pure perfection is discovered in the effects must first exist in the cause (<em>via affirmationis</em>) and at the same time that whatever imperfection is discovered in the effects must be excluded from the cause (<em>via negationis vel exclusionis</em>). These two principles do not contradict, but only balance and correct one another.

<p>(ii) Yet sometimes men are led by a natural tendency to think and speak of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as if He were a magnified creature &#151; more especially a magnified man &#151; and this is known as <a href="../cathen/01558c.htm">anthropomorphism</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to see or hear, as if He had physical organs, or to be angry or sorry, as if subject to human passions: and this perfectly legitimate and more or less unavoidable use of metaphor is often quite unfairly alleged to prove that the strictly Infinite is unthinkable and unknowable, and that it is really a finite <a href="../cathen/01558c.htm">anthropomorphic</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that men worship. But whatever <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> there may be in this charge as applied to <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">Polytheistic religions</a>, or even to the Theistic <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> of rude and uncultured minds, it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a> and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> when directed against <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> Theism. The same reasons that justify and recommend the use of metaphorical language in other connections justify and recommended it here, but no Theist of average intelligence ever thinks of understanding literally the metaphors he applies, or hears applied by others, to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, any more than he means to speak literally when he calls a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> man a lion, or a cunning one a fox.



<p>(iii) Finally it should be observed that, while predicating pure perfections literally both of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of creatures, it is always understood that these predicates are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> higher sense of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than of creatures, and that there is no thought of coordinating or classifying <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with creatures. This is technically expressed by saying that all our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/01449a.htm"><em>analogical</em></a>, and that all predicates applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to creatures are used <a href="../cathen/01449a.htm">analogically</a>, not univocally. I may look at a portrait or at its living original, and say of either, with literal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that is a beautiful face. And this is an example of analogical predication. Beauty is literally and truly realized both in the portrait and its living original, and retains its proper meaning as applied to either; there is sufficient likeness or analogy to justify literal predication but there is not that perfect likeness or identity between <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> and living beauty which univocal predication would imply. And similarly in the case of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and creatures. What we contemplate directly is the portrait of Him <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a>, so to speak, by Himself on the canvas of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> and exhibiting in a finite degree various perfections, which, without losing their proper meaning for us, are seen to be capable of being realized in an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> degree; and our reason compels us to infer that they must be and are so realized in Him who is their ultimate cause.

<p>Hence we admit, in conclusion, that our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Infinite is <em>inadequate</em>, and necessarily so since our minds are only finite. But this is very different from the <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnostic</a> contention that the Infinite is altogether unknowable, and that the statements of Theists regarding the nature and attributes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are so many plain contradictions. It is only by ignoring the well-recognized rules of predication that have just been explained, and consequently by misunderstanding and misrepresenting the Theistic position, that <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnostics</a> succeed in giving an air of superficial plausibility to their own philosophy of blank negation. Anyone who understands those rules, and has learned to think clearly, and trusts his own reason and common sense, will find it easy to meet and refute <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnostic</a> arguments, most of which, in principle, have been anticipated in what precedes. Only one general observation need be made here &#151; that the principles to which the <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> must appeal in his attempt to invalidate religious <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> would, if consistently applied, invalidate all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and lead to universal scepticism &#151; and it is safe to say that, unless absolute scepticism becomes the philosophy of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnosticism</a> will never supplant religion.

<h3 id="IB">Unity or unicity of God</h3>

<p>Obviously there can be <em>only one</em> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> being, only one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If several were to exist, none of them would really be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, for, to have plurality of natures at all, each should have some perfection not possessed by the others. This will be readily granted by every one who admits the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there is no need to delay in developing what is perfectly clear. It should be noted, however, that some Theistic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> prefer to deduce unicity from self-existence and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> from both combined, and in a matter so very abstract it is not surprising that slight differences of opinion should arise. But we have followed what seems to us to be the simpler and clearer line of argument. The metaphysical argument by which unicity, as distinct from <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, is <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a> from self-existence seems to be very obscure, while on the other hand <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, as distinct from unicity, seems to be clearly implied in self-existence as such. If the question, for example, be asked: Why may there not be several self-existing beings? The only satisfactory answer, as it seems to us, is this: Because a self-existent being as such is necessarily <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, and there cannot be several <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinities</a>. The unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the First Cause might also be inductively inferred from the unity of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it; but as the suggestion might be made, and could not be disproved, that there may be another or even several <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universes</a> of which we have no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, this argument would not be absolutely conclusive.

<h3 id="IC">Simplicity of God</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a simple being or substance excluding every kind of composition, physical or metaphysical. Physical or real composition is either substantial or accidental &#151; substantial, if the being in question consists of two or more substantial principles, forming parts of a composite whole, as man for example, consists of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; accidental, if the being in question, although simple in its substance (as is the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>), is capable of possessing accidental perfections (like the actual thoughts and volition of man's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>) not necessarily identical with its substance. Now it is clear that an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> being cannot be substantially composite, for this would mean that <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> is made up of the union or addition of finite parts &#151; a plain contradiction in terms. Nor can accidental composition be attributed to the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> since even this would imply a capacity for increased perfection, which the very notion of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> excludes. There is not, therefore, and cannot be any physical or real composition in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Neither can there be that kind of composition which is known as metaphysical, and which results from "the union of diverse concepts referring to the same real thing in such a way that none of them by itself signifies either explicitly or even implicitly the whole reality signified by their combination." Thus every actual contingent being is a metaphysical compound of <em>essence</em> and <em>existence</em>, and man in particular, according to the definition, is a compound of animal and rational. Essence as such in relation to a contingent being merely implies its conceivableness or possibility, and abstracts from actual existence; existence as such must be added before we can speak of the being as actual. But this distinction, with the composition it implies, cannot be applied to the self-existent or <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> being in whom essence and existence are completely identified. We say of a contingent being that it <em>has</em> a certain nature or essence, but of the self-existent we say that it <em>is</em> its own nature or essence. There is no composition therefore of essence and existence &#151; or of potentiality and actuality &#151; in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor can the composition of genus and specific difference, implied for example in the definition of man as a rational animal, be attributed to Him. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be classified or defined, as contingent beings are classified and defined; for there is no aspect of being in which He is <em>perfectly</em> similar to the finite, and consequently no genus in which He can be included. From this it follows that we cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <em>adequately</em> in the way in which He knows Himself, but not, as the <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnostic</a> contends, that our inadequate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> as far as it goes. In speaking of a being who transcends the limitations of formal <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> definition our propositions are an expression of real <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, provided that what we state is in itself intelligible and not self-contradictory; and there is nothing unintelligible or contradictory in what Theists predicate of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that no single predicate is adequate or exhaustive as a description of His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> perfection, and that we need to employ a multitude of predicates, as if at first sight <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> could be reached by multiplication. But at the same time we recognize that this is not so &#151; being repugnant to the Divine simplicity; and that while <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, wisdom, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and other attributes, as we conceive and define them express perfections that are formally distinct, yet as applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> they are all ultimately identical in meaning and describe the same ultimate reality &#151; the one <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> perfect and simple being.

<h3 id="ID">Divine personality</h3>

<p>When we say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a personal being we mean that He is intelligent and free and distinct from the created <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. Personality as such expresses perfection, and if human <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> as such connotes imperfection, it must be remembered that, as in the case of similar predicates, this connotation is excluded when we attribute <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is principally by way of opposition to <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a> that Divine <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> is emphasized by the Theistic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. Human <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, is one of the primary data of consciousness, and it is one of those created perfections which must be realized formally (although only analogically) in the First Cause. But <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a> would require us to deny the reality of any such perfection, whether in creatures or in the Creator, and this is one of the fundamental objections to any form of <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheistic</a> teaching. Regarding the mystery of the Trinity or three Divine Persons in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which can be known only by revelation, it is enough to say here that properly understood the mystery contains no contradiction, but on the contrary adds much that is helpful to our inadequate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<h2 id="ii">As known through faith ("the God of revelation")</h2>

<p>Reason, as we have seen, teaches that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is one simple and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> perfect spiritual substance or nature. <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> teach the same. The creeds, for example, usually begin with a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">one true God</a>, Who is the Creator and Lord of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, and is also, in the words of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, "omnipotent, eternal, immense, incomprehensible, <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will and in every perfection" (Sess. III, cap. i, De Deo). The best way in which we can describe the Divine nature is to say that it is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> perfect, or that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> perfect Being; but we must always remember that even <em>being</em> itself, the most abstract and universal term we possess, is predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of creatures not univocally or identically, but only analogically. But other predicates, which, as applied to creatures, express certain specific determinations of being, are also used of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> &#151; analogically, if in themselves they express pure or unmixed perfection, but only metaphorically if they necessarily connote imperfection. Now of such predicates as applied to creatures we distinguish between those that are used in the concrete to denote <em>being as such</em> more or less determined (v.g., substance, spirit, etc.), and those that are used in the abstract or adjectively to denote <em>determinations</em>, or <em>qualities</em>, or <em>attributes</em> of being (v.g., good, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; intelligent, intelligence, etc.); and we find it useful to transfer this distinction to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to speak of the Divine <em>nature</em> or essence and Divine <em>attributes</em> being careful at the same time, by insisting on Divine simplicity, to avoid <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> or contradiction in its application. For, as applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the distinction between nature and attributes, and between the attributes themselves, is merely <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> and not real. The finite mind is not capable of comprehending the Infinite so as adequately to describe its essence by any single concept or term; but while using a multitude of terms, all of which are analogically <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, we do not mean to imply that there is any kind of composition in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus, as applied to creatures, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, for example, are distinct from each other and from the nature or substance of the beings in whom they are found, and if finite limitations compel us to speak of such perfections in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as if they were similarly distinct, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, nevertheless, and are ready, when needful, to explain, that this is not really so, but that all <a href="../cathen/02062e.htm">Divine attributes</a> are really identical with one another and with the Divine essence.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02062e.htm">Divine attributes</a> or perfections which may thus <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> be distinguished are very numerous, and it would be a needless task to attempt to enumerate them fully. But among them some are recognized as being of fundamental importance, and to these in particular is the term <em>attributes</em> applied and special notice devoted by <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> &#151; though there is no rigid agreement as to the number or classification of such attributes. As good a classification as any other is that based on the analogy of <em>entitative</em> and <em>operative</em> perfections in creatures &#151; the former qualifying nature or essence as such and abstracting from activity, the latter referring especially to the activity of the nature in question. Another distinction is often made between <em>physical</em>, and <em>moral</em> or <em>ethical</em>, attributes &#151; the former of themselves abstracting from, while the latter directly express, <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">moral perfection</a>. But without labouring with the question of classification, it will suffice to notice separately those attributes of leading importance that have not been already explained. Nothing need be added to what has been said above concerning <em>self-existence, <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, unity</em>, and <em>simplicity</em> (which belong to the entitative class); but <em><a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, immensity</em>, and <em>immutability</em> (also of the entitative class), together with the active attributes, whether physical or moral, connected with the Divine <em><a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a></em> and <em>will</em>, call for some explanation here.

<h3 id="IIA">Eternity</h3>

<p>By saying that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is eternal we mean that in essence, life, and action He is altogether beyond temporal limits and relations. He has neither beginning, nor end, nor duration by way of sequence or succession of moments. There is no past or future for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> &#151; but only an eternal present. If we say that He <em>was</em> or that He <em>acted</em>, or that He <em>will be</em> or <em>will act</em>, we mean in strictness that He <em>is</em> or that He <em>acts</em>; and this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is well expressed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> when He says (<a href="../bible/joh008.htm#vrs58">John 8:58</a> &#151; A.V.): "Before Abraham <em>was</em>, I <em>am</em>." <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternity</a>, therefore, as predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, does not mean indefinite duration in time &#151; a meaning in which the term is sometimes used in other connections &#151; but it means the total exclusion of the finiteness which time implies. We are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to use negative language in describing it, but in itself <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is a positive perfection, and as such may be best defined in the words of <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> as being "interminabilis vitae tota simul et perfecta possessio," i.e. possession in full entirety and perfection of life without beginning, end, or succession.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a corollary from His self-existence and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>. Time being a measure of finite existence, the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> must transcend it. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, coexists <em>with</em> time, as He coexists with creatures, but He does not exist <em>in</em> time, so as to be subject to temporal relations: His self-existence is timeless. Yet the positive perfection expressed by duration as such, i.e. persistence and permanence of being, belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and is truly predicated of Him, as when He is spoken of, for example, as "Him that is, and that was and that is to come" (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs4">Revelation 1:4</a>); but the strictly temporal connotation of such predicates must always be corrected by recalling the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> notion of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.

<h3 id="IIB">Immensity and ubiquity, or omnipresence</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/14167a.htm">Space</a>, like time, is one of the measures of the finite, and as by the attribute of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, we describe <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> transcendence of all temporal limitations, so by the attribute of immensity we express His transcendent relation to space. There is this difference, however, to be noted between <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> and immensity, that the positive aspect of the latter is more easily realized by us, and is sometimes spoken of, under the name of omnipresence, or ubiquity, as if it were a distinct attribute. Divine immensity means on the one hand that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is necessarily present everywhere in space as the immanent cause and sustainer of creatures, and on the other hand that He transcends the limitations of actual and possible space, and cannot be circumscribed or measured or divided by any <a href="../cathen/14167a.htm">spatial</a> relations. To say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is immense is only another way of saying that He is both immanent and transcendent in the sense already explained. As some one has metaphorically and paradoxically expressed it, "God's centre is everywhere, His circumference nowhere."

<p>That <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not subject to <a href="../cathen/14167a.htm">spatial</a> limitations follows from His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> simplicity; and that He is truly present in every place or thing &#151; that He is omnipresent or ubiquitous &#151; follows from the fact that He is the cause and ground of all reality. According to our finite manner of thinking we conceive this presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in things <a href="../cathen/14167a.htm">spatial</a> as being primarily a presence of power and operation &#151; immediate Divine efficiency being required to sustain created beings in existence and to enable them to act; but, as every kind of Divine action <em>ad extra</em> is really identical with the Divine nature or essence, it follows that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is really present everywhere in creation not merely <em>per virtuten et operationem</em>, but <em>per essentiam</em>. In other words <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, or the Divine nature, is in immediate contact with, or immanent in, every creature &#151; conserving it in being and enabling it to act. But while insisting on this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> we must, if we would avoid contradiction, reject every form of the <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> hypothesis. While emphasizing Divine immanence we must not overlook Divine transcendence.

<p>There is no lack of Scriptural or <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> testimonies asserting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> immensity and ubiquity. It is enough to refer for example to: <ul><li><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#vrs3">Hebrews 1:3</a> and <a href="../bible/heb004.htm#vrs12">4:12-13</a><li><a href="../bible/act017.htm#vrs24">Acts 17:24-28</a><li><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#vrs23">Ephesians 1:23</a>; <li><a href="../bible/col001.htm#vrs16">Colossians 1:16-17</a>, <li><a href="../bible/psa138.htm#vrs7">Psalm 138:7-12</a><li><a href="../bible/job012.htm#vrs10">Job 12:10</a>, etc.</ul>

<h3 id="IIC">Immutability</h3>

<p>In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "there is no change, nor shadow of alteration" (<a href="../bible/jam001.htm#vrs17">James 1:17</a>); "They [i.e. "the works of thy hands"] shall perish, but thou shalt continue: and they shall all grow old as a garment. And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art the selfsame and thy years shall not fail" (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#vrs10">Hebrews 1:10-12</a>, <a href="../bible/psa101.htm#vrs26">Psalm 101:26-28</a>. Cf. <a href="../bible/mal003.htm#vrs6">Malachi 3:6</a>; <a href="../bible/heb013.htm#vrs8">Hebrews 13:8</a>). These are some of the Scriptural texts which clearly teach Divine immutability or unchangeableness, and this attribute is likewise emphasized in church teaching, as by the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, who attributed mutability to the Logos (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, 54-old No. 18), and by the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> in its famous definition.

<p>That the Divine nature is essentially immutable, or incapable of any internal change, is an obvious corollary from Divine <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>. Changeableness implies the capacity for increase or diminution of perfection, that is, it implies finiteness and imperfection. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> perfect and is necessarily what He is. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that some attributes by which certain aspects of Divine perfection are described are hypothetical or relative, in the sense that they presuppose the contingent fact of creation: omnipresence, for example, presupposes the actual existence of <a href="../cathen/14167a.htm">spatial</a> beings. But it is obvious that the mutability implied in this belongs to creatures, and not to the Creator; and it is a strange confusion of thought that has led some modern Theists &#151; even professing <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> &#151; to maintain that such attributes can be laid aside by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that the Logos in becoming incarnate actually did lay them aside, or at least ceased from their active exercise. But as creation itself did not affect the immutability of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so neither did the incarnation of a Divine Person; whatever change was involved in either case took place solely in the created nature.

<h3 id="IID">The divine attributes</h3>

<p>The so-called active <a href="../cathen/02062e.htm">Divine attributes</a> are best treated in connection with the Divine Intellect and Will &#151; principles of Divine operation <em>ad extra</em> &#151; to which they are all ultimately reducible.

<h3 id="IID1">Divine knowledge</h3>

<p><em>Description of the Divine Knowledge</em>

<p>That <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is omniscient or possesses the most perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all things, follows from His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> perfection. In the first place He knows and comprehends Himself fully and adequately, and in the next place He knows all created objects and comprehends their finite and contingent mode of being. Hence He knows them individually or singularly in their finite multiplicity, knows everything possible as well as actual; knows what is bad as well as what is good. Everything, in a word, which to our finite minds signifies perfection and completeness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> may be predicated of Divine omniscience, and it is further to be observed that it is on Himself alone that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> depends for His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. To make Him in any way dependent on creatures for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of created objects would destroy His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> perfection and supremacy. Hence it is in His eternal, unchangeable, comprehensive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Himself or of His own <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> being that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> knows creatures and their acts, whether there is question of what is actual or merely possible. Indeed, Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> itself is really identical with Divine essence, as are all the attributes and acts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but according to our finite modes of thought we feel the need of conceiving them distinctly and of representing the Divine essence as the medium or mirror in which the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> sees all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Moreover, although the act of Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> simple in itself, we feel the need of further distinctions &#151; not as regards the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in itself, but as regards the multiplicity of finite objects which it embraces. Hence the universally recognized distinction between the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of vision (<em>scientia visionis</em>) and that of simple intelligence (<em>simplicis intelligentiae</em>), and the famous controversy regarding the <em>scientia media</em>. We shall briefly explain this distinction and the chief difficulties involved in this controversy.

<p><em>Distinctions in the Divine Knowledge</em>

<p>In classifying the objects of Divine omniscience the most obvious and fundamental distinction is between things that actually exist at any time, and those that are merely possible. And it is in reference to these two classes of objects that the distinction is made between <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> "of vision" and "of simple intelligence"; the former referring to things actual, and the latter to the merely possible. This distinction might appear at first sight to be absolutely comprehensive and adequate to the purpose for which we introduce distinctions at all, but some difficulty is felt once the question is raised of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the acts of creatures endowed with <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. That <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> knows infallibly and from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> what, for example, a certain man, in the exercise of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, will do or actually does in any given circumstances, and what he might or would actually have done in different circumstances is beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> &#151; being a corollary from the eternal actuality of Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. So to speak, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has not to wait on the contingent and temporal event of the man's free choice to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what the latter's action will be; He knows it from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. But the difficulty is: how, from our finite point of view, to interpret and explain the mysterious manner of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of such events without at the same time sacrificing the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> of the creature.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> has defended the view that the distinction between <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of "vision" and of "simple intelligence" is the only one we need or ought to employ in our effort to conceive and describe Divine omniscience, even in relation to the free acts of intelligent creatures. These acts, if they ever take place, are known or foreknown by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as if they were <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> actual &#151; and this is admitted by all; otherwise they remain in the category of the merely possible &#151; and this is what the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> denies, pointing for example to statements such as that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> regarding the people of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and Sidon, who would have done penance had they received the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs21">Matthew 11:21</a>). This <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> therefore maintains that to the actual as such and the purely possible we must add another category of objects: hypothetical facts that may never become actual, but would become actual were certain conditions realized. The hypothetical <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of such facts, it is rightly contended, is more than mere possibility, yet less than actuality; and since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> knows such facts in their hypothetical character there is good reason for introducing a distinction to cover them &#151; and this is the <em>scientia media</em>. And it is clear that even acts that take place and as such fall finally under the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of vision may be conceived as falling first under the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of simple intelligence and then under the <em>scientia media</em>, the progressive formula would be: <ul><li>first, <em>it is possible</em> Peter would do so and so; <li>second, Peter <em>would</em> do so and so, given certain conditions; <li>third, Peter <em>will do</em> or <em>does</em> so and so.</ul>

<p>Now, were it not for the differences that lie behind there would probably be no objection raised to <em>scientia media</em>, but the distinction itself is only the prelude to the real problem. Admitting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> knows from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> the future free acts of creatures the question is how or in what way He knows them or rather how we are to conceive and explain by analogy the manner of the divine foreknowledge, which in itself is beyond our powers of comprehension? It is admitted that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> knows them first as objects of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of simple intelligence; but does he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them also as objects of the <em>scientia media</em>, i.e. hypothetically and independently of any <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of His will, determining their actuality, or does He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them only in and through such decrees? The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> contention is that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of future free acts depends on the decrees of His <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> which predetermine their actuality by means of the <em>praemotio physica</em>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> knows, for example, that Peter will do so and so, because He has decreed from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> so to move Peter's <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> that the latter will infallibly, although freely, cooperate with, or consent to, the Divine premotion. In the case of good acts there is a physical and intrinsic connection between the motion given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the consent of Peter's will, while as regards morally bad acts, the immorality as such &#151; which is a privation and not a positive entity &#151; comes entirely from the created will.

<p>The principal difficulties against this view are that in the first place it seems to do away with human <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, and in the next place to make <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> responsible for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Both consequences of course are denied by those who uphold it, but, making all due allowance for the mystery which shrouds the subject, it is difficult to see how the denial of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> is not <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> involved in the theory of the <em>praemotio physica</em>, how the will can be said to consent freely to a motion which is conceived as predetermining consent; such explanations as are offered merely amount to the assertion that, after all, the human will is free. The other difficulty consists in the twofold fact that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is represented as giving the <em>praemotio physica</em> in the natural order for the act of will by which the sinner embraces <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and that He withholds the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <em>praemotio</em> or efficacious grace which is essentially required for the performance of a salutary act. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, on the other hand &#151; with whom probably a majority of independent <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> agree &#151; using the <em>scientia media</em> maintains that we ought to conceive <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of future free acts not as being dependent and consequent upon decrees of His will, but in its character as hypothetical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or being antecedent to them. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> knows in the <em>scientia media</em> what Peter would do if in given circumstances he were to receive a certain aid, and this before any absolute <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> to give that aid is supposed. Thus there is no predetermination by the Divine of what the human will freely chooses; it is not because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foreknows (having foredecreed) a certain <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> that that act takes place, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foreknows it in the first instance because as a matter of fact it is going to take place; He knows it as a hypothetical objective fact before it becomes an object of the <em>scientia visionis</em> &#151; or rather this is how, in order to safeguard human liberty, we must conceive Him as knowing it. It was thus, for example, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what would have been the results of His ministry among the people of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and <a href="../cathen/13777a.htm">Sidon</a>. But one must be careful to avoid implying that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is in any way dependent on creatures, as if He had, so to speak, to await the actual event in time before knowing infallibly what a free creature may choose to do. From <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> He knows, but does not predetermine the creature's choice. And if it be asked how we can conceive this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to exist antecedently to and independently of some act of the Divine will, on which all things contingent depend, we can only say that the objective <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> expressed by the hypothetical facts in question is somehow reflected in the Divine Essence, which is the mirror of all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and that in knowing Himself <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> knows these things also. Whichever way we turn we are bound ultimately to encounter a mystery, and, when there is a question of choosing between a theory which refers the mystery to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself and one which only saves the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of human freedom by making <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> itself a mystery, most <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> naturally prefer the former alternative.

<h3 id="IID2">The divine will</h3>

<p><em>Description of the Divine Will</em>

<p>(a) The highest perfections of creatures are reducible to functions of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will, and, as these perfections are realized analogically in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we naturally pass from considering Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or intelligence to the study of Divine volition. The object of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as such is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; the object of will as such, the good. In the case of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> it is evident that His own <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is the primary and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> object of His will, created <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> being but a secondary and contingent object. This is what the inspired writer means when he says: "The Lord hath made all things for himself" (<a href="../bible/pro016.htm#vrs4">Proverbs 16:4</a>). The Divine will of course, like the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, is really identical with the Divine Essence but according to our finite modes of thought we are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to speak of them as if they were distinct and, just as the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot be dependent on created objects for its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of them, neither can the Divine will be so dependent for its volition. Had no creature ever been created, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would have been the same self-sufficient being that He is, the Divine will as an appetitive faculty being satisfied with the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the Divine Essence itself. This is what the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> means by speaking of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as "most <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in and by Himself" &#151; not that He does not truly wish and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of creatures, which is a participation of His own, but that He has no need of creatures and is in no way dependent on them for His bliss.

<p>(b) Hence it follows that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> possesses the perfection of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> in an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> eminent degree. That is to say, without any change in Himself or in His eternal act of volition, He freely chooses whether or not creatures shall exist and what manner of existence shall be theirs, and this choice or determination is an exercise of that dominion which <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> (liberty of indifference) essentially expresses. In itself <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> is an absolute and positive perfection, and as such is most fully realized in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Yet we are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to describe Divine liberty as we have done relatively to its effects in creation, and, by way of negation, we must exclude the imperfections associated with <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> in creatures. These imperfections may be reduced to two: <ul><li>potentiality and mutability as opposed to immutable pure act, and <li>the power of choosing what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</ul> Only the second need be noticed here.

<p>(c) When a free creature chooses what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, he does not choose it formally as such, but only <em>sub specie boni</em>, i.e., what his will really embraces is some aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> which he truly or falsely believes to be discoverable in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> act. Moral <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ultimately consists in choosing some such fancied good which is known more or less clearly to be opposed to the Supreme Good, and it is obvious that only a finite being can be capable of such a choice. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> necessarily loves Himself, who is the Supreme Good, and cannot wish anything that would be opposed to Himself. Yet He permits the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of creatures, and it has always been considered one of the gravest problems of theism to explain why this is so. We cannot enter on the Problem here, but must content ourselves with a few brief observations. <ul><li>First, however difficult or even mysterious, may be the problem of moral <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for the theist, it is many times more difficult for every kind of <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">anti-theist</a>. <li>Secondly, so far as we can judge the possibility of moral defection seems to be a natural limitation of created <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, and can only be excluded supernaturally, and, even viewing the question from a purely rational standpoint, we are conscious on the whole that, whatever the final solution may be, it is better that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should have created free beings capable of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> than that He should not have created free beings at all. Few men would resign the faculty of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> just to escape the danger of abusing it. <li>Thirdly, some final solution, not at present apparent to our limited intelligence, may be expected on merely rational grounds from the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> revelation, which gives us glimpses of the Divine plan, goes a long way towards supplying a complete answer to the questions that most intimately concern us. The clearly perceived <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to be emphasized here is that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hateful</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and essentially opposed to His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and that the wilful discord which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> introduces into the harmony of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> will somehow be set right in the end.</ul>

<p>There is no need to delay in discussing mere physical as distinct from moral <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and it is enough to remark that such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not merely permitted, but willed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not indeed in its character as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but as being, in such a <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> as the present, a means towards good and in itself relatively good.

<p><em>Distinctions in the Divine Will</em>

<p>As distinctions are made in the Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, so also in the Divine will, and one of these latter is of sufficient importance to deserve a passing notice here. This is the distinction between the <em>antecedent</em> and <em>consequent</em> will, and its principal application is to the question of man's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#vrs4">1 Timothy 2:4</a>),"wills that all men be saved", and this is explained to be an antecedent will; that is to say, abstracting from circumstances and conditions which may interfere with the fulfilment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will (e.g., <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on man's part, natural order in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, etc.), He has a sincere wish that all men should attain <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and this will is so far efficacious that He provides and intends the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> means of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for all &#151; sufficient <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual graces</a> for those who are capable of cooperating with them and the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Sacrament of Baptism</a> for infants. On the other hand, the consequent will takes account of those circumstances and conditions and has reference to what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills and executes in consequence of them. It is thus, for example, that He condemns the wicked to punishment after death and excludes unbaptized infants from the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>.

<h3 id="IID3">Intellect and will (providence, predestination, and reprobation)</h3>

<p>Several attributes and several aspects of Divine activity partake both of an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and a volitional character and must be treated from the combined point of view. Such are <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, blessedness, and so forth, but it is unnecessary to delay on such attributes which are self-explanatory. Some notice, on the other hand, must be devoted to <em>providence</em> and to the particular aspects of providence which we call <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm"><em>predestination</em></a> and <em>reprobation</em>; and with a brief treatment of these which are elsewhere fully treated this article will be concluded.

<p><em>Providence</em>

<p>Providence may be defined as the scheme in the Divine mind by which all things treated are ordered and guided efficiently to a common end or purpose (<em>ratio perductionis rerum in finem in mente divina existens</em>). It includes an act of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and an act of will, in other words <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and power. And that there is such a thing as <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> by which the entire <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is ruled clearly follows from the fact that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the author of all things and that order and purpose must characterize the action of an intelligent creator. Nor is any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> more insistently proclaimed in revelation. What the author of Wisdom (xiv, 3) says of a particular thing is applicable to the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> as a whole: "But your <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, O Father, governs it", and no more beautiful illustration of the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has ever been given than that given by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself when He instances <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> care for the birds of the air and the lilies of the field (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#vrs25">Matthew 6:25 sq.</a>). But to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">rational</a> creatures <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> providential care is extended in a very special way, yet not so as to do away with the utility and efficacy of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, whether for temporal or spiritual favours (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#vrs8">Matthew 7:8</a>), nor to disturb or override the efficiency of secondary causes. It is in and through secondary causes that providence ordinarily works, and no <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, as a rule, is to be expected in answer to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>

<p><em>Predestination and reprobation</em>

<p><a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">Predestination</a> and reprobation are those special parts of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> which deal specially with man's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> or damnation in the present <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a>. <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">Predestination</a> is the foreknowledge on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of those who will <em>de facto</em> be saved and the preparation and bestowal of the means by which <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is obtained, while reprobation is the foreknowledge of those who will <em>de facto</em> be damned and the permission of this eventuality by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In both cases an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> (infallible foreknowledge), and an act of the will are supposed; but whereas in <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> the antecedent and consequent will is the same, in reprobation <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills consequently what He does not antecedently will at all but only permits, namely, the eternal punishment of the sinner.

<p>Many controversies have arisen on the subject of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> and reprobation, into which we cannot enter here. But we shall briefly summarize the leading points on which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> have agreed and the points on which they differ.

<p>First, that <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> exists, i.e. that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> knows from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> with infallible <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> who will be saved and that He wills from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> to give them the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> by which <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> will be secured, is obvious from reason and is taught by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#vrs27">John 10:27</a>), and by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs29">Romans 8:29, 30</a>).

<p>Second, while <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has this infallible foreknowledge, we on our part cannot have an absolutely certain assurance that we are among the number of the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> &#151; unless indeed by means of a special <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a> such as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from experience is rarely, if ever, given. This follows from the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> condemnation of the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> that we could and ought to believe with the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in our own justification and election (Sess. VI, cap. ix, can. xiii-xv).

<p>Third, the principal controverted point regarding <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> is concerned with its gratuity, and in order to understand the controversy it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to distinguish between <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> <em>in intention</em>, i.e. as it is a mere act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and of purpose in the Divine mind, and <em>in execution</em>, i.e. as it means the actual bestowal of grace and of glory; and also between <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> in the adequate sense, as referring both to grace and to glory, and in the <em>inadequate</em> sense, as referring particularly to one's destination to glory, and abstracting from the grace by which glory is obtained. Now, <ul><li>speaking of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> in execution, all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> maintain in opposition to <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> that it is not entirely gratuitous, but in the case of adults depends partly on the free mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and partly on human cooperation; the actual bestowal of glory is at least partly a reward of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> merit. <li>Speaking of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> in intention and in the adequate sense, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> agree that it is gratuitous; so understood it includes the first grace which cannot be merited by man. <li>But if we speak of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> in intention and in the inadequate sense, i.e. to glory in abstraction from grace, there is no longer unanimity of opinion. Most <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> and several other <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> maintain that <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> in this sense is gratuitous, i.e. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> first destines a man to glory antecedently to any foreseen merits, and consequently upon this decrees to give the efficacious grace by which it is obtained. <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">Predestination</a> to grace is the result of an entirely gratuitous <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> to glory, and with this is combined for those not included in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of election what is known as a negative reprobation. Other <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> maintain on the contrary that there is no such thing as negative reprobation, and that <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> to glory is not gratuitous but dependent on foreseen merits. The order of dependence, according to these <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, is the same in <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> in intention as it is in <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> in execution, and as already stated, the bestowal of glory only follows upon actual merit in the case of adults. These have been the two prevailing opinions followed for the most part in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, but a third opinion, which is a somewhat subtle <em>via media</em>, has been put forward by certain other <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and defended with great skill by such an authority as Billot. The gist of this view is that while negative reprobation must be rejected, gratuitous election to glory <em>ante praevisa merita</em> must be retained, and an effort is made to prove that these two may be <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> separated, a possibility overlooked by the advocates of the first two opinions. Without entering into details here, it is enough to observe that the success of this subtle expedient is very questionable.</ul>

<p>Fourth, as regards reprobation, <ul><li>all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> are agreed that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foresees from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> and permits the final defection of some, but that the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of His will destining them to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a> is not antecedent to but consequent upon foreknowledge of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and their death in the state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The first part of this proposition is a simple corollary from Divine omniscience and supremacy, and the second part is directed against <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> teaching, according to which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> expressly created some for the purpose of punishing them, or at least that subsequently to the fall of Adam, He leaves them in the state of damnation for the sake of exhibiting His wrath. <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> on this point reechoes <a href="../bible/2pe003.htm#vrs9">2 Peter 3:9</a>, according to which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not wish that any should perish but that all should return to penance, and it is the teaching implied in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> own description of the sentence that is to be pronounced on the damned, condemnation being grounded not on the antecedent will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but on the actual demerits of men themselves (e.g. <a href="../bible/mat025.htm#vrs41">Matthew 25:41</a>). <li>So-called negative reprobation, which is commonly defended by those who maintain election to glory antecedently to foreseen merits, means that simultaneously with the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> either positively excludes the damned from the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of election to glory or at least fails to include them in it, without, however, destining them to positive punishment except consequently on their foreseen demerits. It is this last qualification that distinguishes the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of negative reprobation from <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> teaching, leaving room, for instance, for a condition of perfect natural <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> for those dying with only <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> on their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. But, notwithstanding this difference, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> ought to be rejected, for it is opposed very plainly to the teaching of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> regarding the universality of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will to save all (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#vrs4">1 Timothy 2:4</a>), and from a rational point of view it is difficult to reconcile with a worthy concept of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.</ul>
