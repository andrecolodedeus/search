<h1>The Oratory of Saint Philip Neri</h1>  

<p>Under this head are included the Italian, Spanish, English, and other communities, which follow the rule of <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a>.

<p>The revolt of the sixteenth century, though apparently threatening in its spread and strength the very life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, evoked a marvellous display of its Divine fecundity. That century saw the origin of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, founded by <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius Loyola</a>; the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a>, by St. Cajetan; the <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a>, by St. A. M. Zaccaria; the <a href="../cathen/02802b.htm">Brothers Hospitallers</a>, by <a href="../cathen/08472c.htm">St. John of God</a>; the Oratory of St. Philip. The foundation of the last was laid at S. Girolamo, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where his disciples gathered for spiritual instruction. Gradually these conferences took definite shape, and St. Philip, now a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, constructed an oratory over the aisle of S. Girolamo, where they might be held; from this probably the congregation was named. In 1564 he took charge of the church of the Florentines, where his disciples who were <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> and preached four sermons daily, interspersed by <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and popular devotions. Eleven years' work at St. John's <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to the growing community the necessity of having a church of their own and of living under a definite rule. They obtained from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the church of S. Maria in Vallicella, rebuilt and now known as the Chiesa Nuova, where the congregation was erected by <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>, 15 July, 1575. The new community was to be a congregation of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> living under obedience but bound by no <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. So particular was St. Philip on this point that he ruled, that even if the majority wished to bind themselves by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, the minority who did not were to possess the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the community. "Habeant possideant", were St. Philip's words. Another characteristic of the institute was the fact that each house was independent, and when it was represented to him, that while one house might have but a handful of members and another a surplus, both would benefit by a transference of subjects from the more numerous community, he replied, "Let each house live by its own vitality, or perish of its own decrepitude." His motive probably was to exclude the possibility of any community lingering in a state of decay.

<p>The rule, an embodiment of St. Philip's mode of governing, was not drawn up till seventeen years after his death, and was finally approved by <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> in 1612. The <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> is elected for three years by a majority of all the decennial Fathers, i.e., those who have been ten years in the congregation. To assist him in the government of the congregation four deputies are elected. All matters of grave importance are decided by the general congregation, only the decennial Fathers voting. Admission to the congregation is also by election and the candidate must be "natus ad institutum", between the ages of eighteen and forty, and possessed of sufficient income to maintain himself. The <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> lasts three years, and was probably thus extended to test thoroughly the vocation to an institute not bound by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. At the conclusion of the three years the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> if approved becomes a triennial Father and a member of the congregation, but he has no elective vote till his ten years are complete, when by election he becomes a decennial. Expulsion is effected by a majority of two-thirds of the voters. No member is allowed to take any <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignity</a>. Regulations for the clothing, mode of life in the community, and for the refectory are also laid down. The object of the institute is threefold: <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, preaching, and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. "prayer" includes special care in carrying out the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> Offices, the Fathers being present in choir at the principal feasts, as well as assisting at the daily popular devotions. The "Sacraments" imply their frequent reception, which had fallen into disuse at the foundation of the Oratory. For this purpose one of the Fathers is to sit daily in the confessional, and all are to be present in their confessionals on the eve of feasts. The mode of direction as taught by St. Philip is to be gentle rather than severe, and abuses are to be attacked indirectly. "Once let a little <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> find entrance to their hearts," said St. Philip, "and the rest will follow."

<p>"Preaching" included, as has been said four sermons in succession daily, an almost impossible strain upon the hearers as it would now appear, but the discourses at the Oratory had an attraction of their own. <a href="../cathen/13490a.htm">Savonarola</a> had already compared the inability of the preachers of his day to awaken dead <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> with their subtle arguments and their rhetorical periods, to the impotent efforts of the flute-players to revivify by their mournful music the corpse of Jairus's daughter, and <a href="../cathen/02425e.htm">Bembo</a> in St. Philip's day reiterated this reproach. "What can I hear in <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a>!", he says, "but Doctor Subtilis striving with <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Doctor Angelicus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> coming in as a third to decide the quarrel." The sermons at the Oratory were free from these defects. They were simple and familiar discourses; the first an exposition on some point of the spiritual reading which preceded them, and therefore impromptu; the next would be on some text of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>; the third on <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>, and the fourth on the lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Each sermon lasted half an hour, when a bell was rung and the preacher at once ceased speaking. The music though popular, was of a high order. <a href="../cathen/11421b.htm">Palestrina</a>, a penitent of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, composed many of the Laudi which were sung. Their excellence excited the admiration of foreigners. John Evelyn in his diary, 8 November, 1644, speaks of himself as ravished with the entertainment of the sermon by a boy and the musical services at the Roman Oratory. <a href="../cathen/01530a.htm">Animuccia</a>, choir master at St. Peter's, attended constantly to lead the singing. In close connexion with the Oratory is the Brotherhood of the Little Oratory, a confraternity of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, first formed from the disciples of St. Philip who assembled in his room for <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and Mass on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, visited in turn a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> daily, and took the discipline at the exercises of the Passion on Friday. They made together the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of the seven churches, especially at carnival time, and their devout and recollected demeanour converted many.

<p>The "exercises", as the Oratory services were called, aroused bitter opposition. The preachers were denounced as teaching extravagant and unsound <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, the processions were forbidden, and St. Philip himself was suspended from preaching. He submitted at once and forbade any action being taken in his favour. At length <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>, having made due investigation, sent for him and bade him go on with his good work. <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> says of these exercises that they seemed to recall the simplicity of the Apostolic times; Bacci testifies to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of many under St. Philip's care. Among the most celebrated members were <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, author of the "Ecclesiastical Annals", and the "Martyrology", to prepare him for which work St. Philip <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> him to preach the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> for thirty years in the Oratory; Bozio Tommaso, author of many learned works; B. Giovenale Ancina, Superior of the Oratory at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13405c.htm">Saluzzo</a>, a close friend of <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a>; B. Antonio Grassi of the Oratory of <a href="../cathen/06043c.htm">Fermo</a>; B. Sebastian Valfr&eacute;, the "Apostle of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>", and founder of the Oratory, there. The Oratory Library of S. Maria in Vallicella is celebrated for the number and quality of its contents, among them the well-known Codex Vallicensis. Up to 1800 the Oratory continued to spread through <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> countries; in South America, <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>, the founder of which was the celebrated missioner <a href="../cathen/15317b.htm">Giuseppe de Vaz</a>. Under <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a> the Oratory was in various places despoiled and suppressed, but the congregation recovered and, after a second suppression in 1869, again revived; many of its houses still exist.
<h2>English oratorians</h2>

<p>The Oratory was founded in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> by <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman</a> in 1847. Converted in 1845, he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1846 and with the advice of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius</a> selected the Oratory of St. Philip Neri as best adapted for his future work. After a short <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at Santa Croce he returned in 1847 with a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> from Pius IX for founding the Oratory. He established himself at Maryvale, Old Oscott, where in 1848 he was joined by Father Faber and his Wilfridian community. After a temporary sojourn at St. Wilfrid's, Staffordshire. and Alcester St., <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>, the community found a permanent home at Edgbaston, a suburb of that town in 1854. The institute of the English congregation is substantially that of the Roman. The Fathers live under St. Philip's Rule and carry out his work. In compliance with a widely expressed wish of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman</a> founded at Edgbaston a still flourishing higher class <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys. A Brotherhood of the Little Oratory is also attached to the community and the exercises are a focus of spiritual life. Among the best known writers of the English Oratory are, besides its illustrious head, Father Caswell, a poet, Father Ignatius Ryder, a controversialist and essayist, and Father Pope. A <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> memorial church in the classical style was opened in 1910. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> contains among many valuable works <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman's</a> series of the Fathers.

<h3 id="london">The London Oratory</h3>

<p>In 1849 <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman</a> sent a detachment of his community to found a house in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. Premises were secured at 24 and 25 King William St., Strand, a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was speedily arranged and on 31 May, <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a> assisted pontifically and preached at the high Mass, Father <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> delivered at <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> the sermon on the "Prospects of the Catholic Missioner", now published in his "Discourses to Mixed Congregations". The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Directory of 1849 shows that the Oratory at King William St. was the first public church served by a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community to be opened in the diocese. The exercises of the Oratory, accompanied as they were with <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> composed by Father Faber and the Roman devotions and processions, then strange to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, seemed to many a hazardous innovation. Time <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the popularity of the exercises, and Father Faber's preaching attracted large crowds. His spiritual works published year by year increased the interest in his Oratory, while the lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> edited by him, forty-two in number, in spite of their literary defects, did a great work in setting forth the highest examples of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">Christian holiness</a>. The community removed to their present site in South Kensington in 1854, and in 1884 their new church was opened in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Among the writers of the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Oratory may be named, after Father Faber, <a href="../cathen/04604b.htm">Father Dalgairns</a>, Father Stanton, "Menology of England and Wales" (London, 1887); Father Hutchison, "Loreto and Nazareth" (London, 1863); Father Knox, "The Douai Diary" (London, 1878), and "Life of Cardinal Allen" (London, 1882); Father Philpin de Rivi&egrave;re, "The Holy Places", and other works; Father John Bowden "Life of Fr. Faber" (London, 1869); Father Morris "Life of St. Patrick"; and Father Antrobus, translator of Pastor's "Popes" (vols. I - VI, St. Louis, 1902) and the "Pregi dell' Oratorio".
