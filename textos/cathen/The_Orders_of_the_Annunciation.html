<h1>The Orders of the Annunciation</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Annunciades</h2>

<p>A penitential order founded by <a href="../cathen/08327b.htm">St. Jeanne de Valois</a> (b. 1464; d. 4 February, 1505), daughter of Louis XI of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and wife of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, later Louis XII. After the annulment of her marriage with Louis XII she retired to <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, where, overcoming the opposition of her confessor Father Gilbert Nicola&iuml;, and the counsellors of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, she succeeded in her design of founding an order in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary</a>. She herself composed the Rule, entitled "The Ten Virtues of the Blessed Virgin", the imitation of which she proposed as the aim of the order. It was confirmed by <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> (1501), and 8 October, 1502, the first five members received the veil, the foundress herself taking solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> 4 June, 1503. Father Gabriel Nicolai, whose name was changed by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> to Gabriele Maria, was constituted Superior, and after revising the constitutions, presented them for confirmation to <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> (1517), who placed the Order under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Order of St. Francis. In addition to the triple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty, chastity, and obedience, the members were bound to the recitation of the Office, the observance of cloistral rule, and the wearing of the habit. This is grey with scarlet <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> and white mantle. Foundations were made in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but did not survive the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. During its most flourishing period the Order possessed forty-five <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, of which several still exist in the latter country. The foundress was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1775.

<h2 id="ii">Celestial Annunciades</h2>

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> founded by Bl. Maria Vittoria Fornari (b. 1562; d. 15 December, 1617) at <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>. The death of her husband, Angelo Strata, left her the care of six children, and it was only after they had entered the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> that she was free to carry out her life work, for which she had been preparing by retirement and the practice of austere <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Her lack of temporal means for some time caused her director, Father Bernardino Zannoni of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> to withhold their consent, which, however, was finally obtained (1602), and a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> was erected at the expense of one of her companions, Vincenza Lomellini. Father Zannoni drew up the constitutions for the religious. <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> approved them in 1604, placing the Order under the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>. In the same year ten members were received, each adding the name Maria Annunziata to her <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> or religious name, and they made their solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> 7 September, 1605. The second foundation was made in 1612, and the third a little later in <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>; after which the Order spread through <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. The constitutions were confirmed by <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> (1613), <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> (1631). The <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> is unusually rigid, and the members devote much of their time to preparing vestments and altar linen for poor churches.

<h2 id="iii">Annunciates of Lombardy</h2>

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order of <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> known as <a href="../cathen/01403a.htm">Ambrosians</a>, Sisters of St. Ambrose, or Sisters of <a href="../cathen/09637c.htm">St. Marcellina</a>, organized at Pavia in 1408 by young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> from <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and Pavia, under the direction of Father Beccaria, O.S.B., for the care of the sick, and at a later date placed under the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>. The constitutions, providing for a prioress-general assisted by three visitors, were approved by <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> but amended by <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>. Eventually each <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> became subject to the <a href="../cathen/11284b.htm">ordinary</a> of its own diocese. Among the many <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> belonging to the order is St. Catherine Fieschi of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>.

<h2 id="iv">Archconfraternity of the Annunciation</h2>

<p>Established in 1460 in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in order to provide dowries for poor girls. During the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> it was connected with the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Church of the Minerva in which was built later the beautiful <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Annunciation. At an earlier period the Pope himself presided at the annual ceremonies held 25 March, and presented with his own hand the documents entitling the recipients to the dower. This association has received large bequests, and benefits on an average four hundred <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> yearly. The money gift is now twenty-five scudi ($25.00) for those about to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marry</a>, and fifty for those entering a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order.
<h2 id="section5">Annunziata</h2>

<p>A name by which the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a> are sometimes known, their chief <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, being <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation</a>.
