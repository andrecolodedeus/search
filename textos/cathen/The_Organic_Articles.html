<h1>The Organic Articles</h1>  

<p>A name given to a law regulating public worship, comprising 77 articles relative to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and 44 relative to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, presented by order of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> to the Tribunate and the legislative body at the same time that he made these two bodies vote on the Concordat itself. Together with the Concordat, the Organic Articles were published as a law, under the same title and the same preamble, 8 April, 1802, and the various governments in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> which have since followed one another, down to 1905, have always professed to regard the Organic Articles as inseparable from the Concordat. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pope Pius VII</a> however, as early as 24 May, 1802, declared formally, in a consistorial allocution, that these articles had been <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> without his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and that he could not accept them without modification.

<p>The Organic Articles which refer to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> fall under four titles. <ul><li>Title I deals with "the government of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in its general relations to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and constitution of the State." In virtue of these articles, the authorization of the Government is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the publication and execution of a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> document in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; for the exercise of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions by any representative of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, for the holding of a National Council or a Diocesan Synod. Moreover, the Council of State, thanks to the formality of the <em>appel comme d'abus</em>, may declare that there is <em>abus</em> in any given acts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, and thus thrust itself into the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <li>Title II deals with the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of public worship whose powers it defines: the rules and regulations of <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> must be submitted to the State, the "Declaration of 1682" must be taught in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, the number of those to be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> must be fixed yearly by the Government; the <em>cur&eacute;s</em> of important <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> cannot be appointed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> without the consent of the State. <li>Under Title III, devoted to public worship, the legislature forbids public processions in towns where there are adherents of different creeds. It fixes the dress of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who must be dressed "in the French fashion and in black", it prescribes that there shall be only one <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> for all the churches of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. <li>Article IV has reference to the boundaries of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and to the salary of <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of religion.</ul>

<p>It was not long, however, before many of these articles became a dead letter. M. Emile Ollivier, in his speech from the tribune. 11 July, 1868, said: "It would be difficult to cite even one or two that are still kept, even these are not enforced every day but are only dragged from their nothingness and obscurity on great occasions, when there is need of seeming to do something while doing nothing." Even the Third Republic never claimed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to prevent the bringing of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> documents into <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, to fix the dress of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, to insist on the teaching of the Declaration of 1682; and the judgments <em>Tanquam ab abusu</em> pronounced by the Council of State against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, have always been mildly platonic.

<p>The Organic Articles as such were the outcome, philosophically speaking, of a certain Gallican and Josephist spirit, whereby the State sought to rule the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Historically speaking, the French Legislature in drawing up these articles, which limited the scope of the Concordat, had set an unfortunate example, followed twenty years later by the various German governments, which having in their turn treated with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, hastened to counteract their own agreements by means of certain territorial enactments.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 1905, which separated <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, abrogated the Organic Articles at the same <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> that it abrogated the <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">Concordat</a>.
