<div id="springfield2">
<h1>The Oxford Movement (1833-1845)</h1>  

<p>The Oxford Movement may be looked upon in two distinct lights. "The conception which lay at its base," according to the Royal Commission on Ecclesiastical Discipline, 1906, "was that of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Holy Catholic Church</a> as a visible body upon earth, bound together by a spiritual but absolute unity, though divided into national and other sections. This conception drew with it the sense of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> continuity, of the intimate and unbroken connection between the primitive Church and the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a>, and of the importance of the Fathers as guides and teachers. It also tended to emphasize points of communion between those different branches of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which recognize the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> or fact of <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">Apostolic Succession</a>" (Report, p. 54). That is the point of view maintained in the "Tracts for the Times" from 1833 to 1841, which gave its familiar name to the "Tractarian" Movement. They originated and ended with <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">John Henry Newman</a>.

<p>But a second, very unlike, account of the matter was put forward by <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> himself in his "Lectures on Anglican Difficulties" of 1850. There he considers that the drift or tendency of this remarkable change was not towards a party in the Establishment, or even towards the first place in it, but away from national divisions altogether. It was meant ultimately to absorb "the various English <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> and parties" into the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, whence their ancestors had come out at the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. And as <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> had been leader in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> phase of the movement, so he opened the way towards <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, submitted to it in 1845, and made popular the reasoning on which thousands followed his example. There seems no other instance adducible from history of a religious thinker who has moulded on permanent lines the institution which he quitted, while assigning causes for its abandonment. But this result was in some measure a consequence of the "anomalous and singular position", as Dean Church allows, held by the English Establishment, since it was legally set up under Elizabeth (Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity, 8 May, 1559).

<p>Lord Chatham brought out these anomalies in a famous epigram. "We have", he remarked, "a Popish Liturgy, <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> articles, and an <a href="../cathen/01740c.htm">Arminian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>." Such differences were visible from the first. "It is historically certain," says J.A. Froude, "that Elizabeth and her <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> intentionally framed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> formulas so as to enable every one to use them who would disclaim allegiance to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>." When the <a href="../cathen/01727c.htm">Armada</a> was scattered and broken, many adherents of the old <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> appear to have conformed; and their impetus accounts for the rise of a High Anglican party, whose chief representative was Launcelot Andrewes, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> (1555-1626). The Anglo-Catholic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was continued by Laud, and triumphed after the Restoration. In 1662 it expelled from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, Baxter and the <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterians</a>. But from the <a href="../cathen/13007b.htm">Revolution in 1688</a> it steadily declined. The non-juring <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were wholly in its tradition, which, through obscure by-ways, was handed on from his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> to John Keble and so to Hurrell Froude and <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>.

<p>However, the Laudian or Carolinian divines must not be supposed to have ever succeeded in driving out their <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> rivals, so powerful when the Thirty-Nine Articles were drawn up, and known from <a href="../cathen/13748c.htm">Shakespeare's</a> time as <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritans</a> (see Malvolio in "Twelfth Night"). Andrewes himself, though taking <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> for his masters, did not admit the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Eucharist. At every period Baptismal Regeneration, <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">Apostolic Succession</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a> were open questions, not decided one way or another by "the stammering lips of ambiguous Formularies." If there was a High Church in power, and if what the <a href="../cathen/01740c.htm">Arminians</a> held, as it was wittily said, were all the best livings in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, yet <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin's</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, whether a little softened by Archbishop Whitgift or according to the text of the "Institutes", never did involve deprivation. It was sheltered by the Articles, as <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Catholic tradition</a> was by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> Book; and the balance was kept between contending <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of opinion by means of the Royal Supremacy.

<p>Suggested by Thomas Cromwell, asserted in Parliamentary legislation under <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> (1534), this prime article of <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicanism</a> made the king supreme head of the English Church on earth, and his tribunal the last court of appeal in all cases, spiritual no less than secular. It has been said of Henry, and is equally <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of Edward VI, that he claimed the whole <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>. Elizabeth, while relinquishing the title of Head and the administration of holy rites, certainly retained and exercised full <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over "all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and all causes" within the realm. She extinguished the ancient <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> "without any proceeding in any spiritual court", as Macaulay observes, and she appointed the new one. She "turned the pulpit", admonished <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, and even supplied by her own legal authority defects in the process of episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> Book itself is an Act of Parliament. "The supreme tribunal of appeal, in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> causes, from 1559 to 1832," we are told, "was that created by 25 Hen. VIII, c. 19, which gave an appeal from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Courts to the King in Chancery for lack of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>" (Dodd, Hist. Canon Law, 232). These powers were exercised by the court of delegates; in 1832 they were transferred to the judicial committee of the privy council, whose members may all be <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>; and, if <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, they do not sit by virtue of their episcopal office but as the king's advisers. Contrast will drive the matter home. The constituent form of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> universal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> (see Florence, Council of; <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>). But the constituent form of the English Church, as established by Parliament, is the universal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Crown. In either case there is no appeal from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> or the royal decision. When Elizabeth broke with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who would not acknowledge her spiritual headship, and when William III deprived Sancroft and his suffragans who refused the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance, a test was applied, dogmatic in 1559, perhaps not less so in 1690, which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proves</a> that no cause of exemption can be pleaded against the king when he acts as supreme governor of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.



<p>Such is the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> often called Erastian, from Erastus, a <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> (1524-83), who denied to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> all power of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the course of events had run on before Erastus could publish its philosophy. Politicians like Burghley and Walsingham acted on no theory, but drew their inspiration from <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>. The abstract statement of a view which identifies the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with the nation and subjects both equally to the king, may be found in Hooker, "The Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity" (1594-97). It was vigorously asserted by Selden and the lawyers at all times. During the critical years of the nineteenth century, Arnold, Stanley and Kingsley were its best known defenders among <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a>. Stanley declared that the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a> "is by the very conditions of its being neither High nor Low, but Broad" ("Ed. Rev.", July, 1850). In coarser but equally practical terms men said, "The Church was grafted upon the State, and the State would remain master." No ruling, in fact, of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or convocation need be regarded by <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a>, lay or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a>, unless it implies, at all events tacitly, the consent of the Crown, i.e. of Parliament.

<p>So long as the State excluded Dissenters and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from its offices, the system, in spite of the Great Rebellion, nay after the more truly disastrous <a href="../cathen/13007b.htm">Revolution of 1688</a>, worked as well as could be expected. But in 1828 the Test Act was repealed; next year Catholic Emancipation was passed into law. In 1830 the French drove out their Bourbon dynasty; <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> threw off the yoke of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. In 1832 came the Reform Bill, which Tories construed into an attack on the church. What would the Royal Supremacy mean if Parliament was no longer to be exclusively <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a>? Lord Grey told the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to set their house in order; ten <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> were suppressed. Arnold wrote in 1832, "The Church, as it now stands, no human power can save." Whately thought it difficult to "preserve the Establishment from utter overthrow." Alexander Knox, a far-seeing <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> writer, said, "The old High Church race is worn out." The "Clapham" <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of Evangelicals, who came down from <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, and the "Clapton sect", otherwise called High and Dry, who had no <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> at all, divided "serious" people among them. Bishops were great <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who amassed wealth for their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, and who had attained to place and influence by servile offices or by editing Greek plays. In the presence of threatened revolution they sat helpless and bewildered. From them neither counsel nor aid was to be expected by earnest <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchmen</a>. Arnold would have brought in Dissenters by a "comprehension" which sacrificed <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> to individual judgment. Whateley protested against "that double usurpation, the interference of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in temporals, of the State in spirituals." A notable preacher and organizer, Dr. Hook, "first gave body and force to Church <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, not to be mistaken or ignored." But it was from Oxford, "the home of lost causes", always Cavalier at heart, still "debating its eternal <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> question as in the days of Henry IV", that <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> came.

<p>Oriel, once illustrated by Raleigh and Butler, was now the most distinguished college in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. For some thirty years it had welcomed original thinkers, and among its fellows were or had been, Copleston, Whateley, Hawkins, Davison, Keble, Arnold, <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Pusey</a>, and Hurrell Froude. "This knot of Oriel men", says Pattison, "was distinctly the product of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>." Those among them who indulged in "free inquiry" were termed "Noetics"; they "called everything in question; they appealed to first principles, and disallowed authority in <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> matters." The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, which Pattison describes as "a close clerical corporation", where all alike had sworn to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> Book and Articles, had thus in its bosom a seed of "Liberalism", and was menaced by changes analogous to the greater revolution in the State itself. Reaction came, as was to be expected, in the very college that had witnessed the provocation. Oxford, of all places, would surely be the last to accept French and democratic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>.

<p>John Keble (1792-1865) was the leading fellow of Oriel. As a mere boy, he had carried off the highest honours of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. In 1823 he became his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> at Fairford, and in 1827 he published "The Christian Year", a cycle of poems or meditations in verse, refined, soothing, and akin to George Herbert's "The Temple", by their spiritual depth and devout attachment to the English Church. They have gone through innumerable editions. Keble, though a scholarly mind, had no grasp of <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>. An ingrained conservative, he took over the doctrines, and lived on the recollection of the Laudian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Without <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>, he was inflexible, never open to development, but gentle, shrewd, and saintly. His convictions needed an Aaron to make them widely effective; and he found a voice in his pupil, the "bright and beautiful" Froude, whose short life (1802-36) counts for much in the Oxford Movement. Froude was the connecting link between Keble and <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>. His friendship, at the moment when <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> Evangelical prejudices were fading and his inclination towards <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> had received a sharp check by "illness and bereavement", proved to be the one thing needful to a temper which always leaned on its associates, and which absorbed <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> with the vivacity of genius. So the fusion came about. Elsewhere (see <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">JOHN HENRY NEWMAN</a>) is related the story of those earlier years in which, from various sources, the future Tractarian leader gained his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of certain <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, one by one. But their living unity and paramount authority were borne in upon him by discussions with Froude, whose teacher was Keble. Froude, says <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, "professed openly his admiration for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>. He delighted in the notion of an <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> system, of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> power, and of full <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> liberty. He felt scorn of the maxim, 'the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> only is the religion of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants'</a>; and he gloried in accepting tradition as a main instrument of religious teaching. He has a high severe <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the intrinsic excellence of virginity . . . He delighted in thinking of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> . . . He embraced the principle of penance and <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>. He had a deep devotion to the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a> in which he had a firm <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. He was powerfully drawn to the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Medieval</a> Church, but not to the Primitive." ("Apol.", p. 24)

<p>These, remarkably enough, are characteristics of the later phases of the Movement, known as Ritualism, rather than of its beginning. Yet <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> friendship with Froude goes back to 1826; they became very intimate after the rejection of Peel by the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in 1829; and the Roman tendencies, of which mention is made above, cannot but have told powerfully on the leader, when his hopes for <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicanism</a> were shattered by the misfortunes of "Tract 90". Keble, on the other hand, had "a great dislike of Rome", as well as of "Dissent and Methodism." The first years of the revival were disfigured by a strong anti-Roman polemic, which Froude, on his death-bed, condemned as so much "cursing and swearing." But <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> had been as a youth "most firmly convinced that the Pope was the <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> predicted by Daniel, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and St. John." His <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> was stained by the effects of this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> as late as the year 1843. In consequence, his language towards the ancient Church only just fell short of the vituperation lavished on it by the <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritans</a> themselves. The movement, therefore, started, not on Roman ground, but in a panic provoked by the alliance of O Connell with the Whigs, of Dissenters with Benthamites, intent on destroying all religious establishments. How could they be resisted? <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> answers in his opening tract, addressed to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> by one of themselves, a fellow-presbyter, "I fear", he tells them, "we have neglected the real ground on which our authority is built, our Apostolical descent." And he made his appeal to the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> service in other words, to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> Book and the sacramental system, of which the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were the Divinely appointed <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>.

<p>The first three tracts are <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 9 September, 1833. <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> and Froude, after their voyage to the Mediterranean in Dec. 1832, had returned in the midst of an agitation in which they were speedily caught up. Keble's sermon in itself not very striking on "National Apostasy", had marked 14 July, 1833, as the birthday of a "second <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>." At Hadleigh, H.J. Rose and three other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a> had met in conference, 25 29 July, and were endeavoring to start a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of Church defence, with machinery and safeguards, as befitted responsible <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. But <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> would not be swamped by committees. "Luther", he wrote, "was an individual." He proposed to be an Apostolical <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. He was not now tutor of Oriel. Hawkins had turned him out of office a curious acknowledgement of the vote by which he had made Hawkins <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> instead of Keble. But he was Vicar of St. Mary's a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> dependent on Oriel, and the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> church. His <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> was one of the most famous in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the secret of journalism, and had at his command a stern eloquence, barbed by convictions, which his reading of the Fathers and the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> folios daily strengthened. He felt supreme confidence in his position. But he was not well read in the history of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> origins or of the Royal Supremacy. His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was an ideal; never, certainly, since the legislation of Henry and Elizabeth had the English Establishment enjoyed the freedom he sought. It had issued <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> imposed by political expediency; it had tolerated among its communicants <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>, Erastians, and in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of high dignitaries like Bishop Hoadley even <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinians</a>. It had never been self-governing in the past any more than it was now. If the "idea or first principle" of the movement was "ecclesiastical liberty", it must be pronounced a failure; for the Royal Supremacy as understood by lawyers and lamented over by High Church divines is still intact.

<p>On that side, therefore, not a shadow of victory appears. Anyone may believe the doctrines peculiar to Tractarian <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, and any one may reject them, without incurring penalties in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Establishment. They are opinions, not <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, not the exclusive teaching that alone constitutes a creed. Fresh from <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> "Ethics", where virtue is said to lie in a mean, the Oriel scholar termed his position the Via Media; it was the golden mean that avoided <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> corruptions and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. But did it exist anywhere except in books? Was it not "as a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, wanting in simplicity, hard to master, indeterminate in its provisions, and without a substantive existence in any age or country?" <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> did not deny that "it still remains to be tried whether what is called Anglo-Catholicism, the religion of Andrewes, Laud, Hammond, Butler, and Wilson, is capable of being professed, acted on, and maintained . . . or whether it be a mere modification or transition-state of Romanism or of popular <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>." The Via Media was an experiment. Perhaps the Established Church "never represented a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> at all . . . never had an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> basis"; perhaps it has "been but a name, or a department of State" (Proph. Office, Introd.). To this second conclusion the author finally came; but not until during eight years he had made trial of his "middle way" and had won to it a crowd of disciples. The Tractarian Movement succeeded after his time in planting among the varieties of <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party. It failed altogether in making of the Establishment a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>Palmer, of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> College, and his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> associates presented an address in 1834, signed with 10,000 names, to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, defending the imperilled interests. Joshua Watson, a leading <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, brought up one more emphatic, to which 230,000 heads of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> gave their adhesion. But of these collective efforts no lasting results came, although they frightened the Government and damped its revolutionary <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. Mr. Rose, a man of high character and distinction, had started the "British Magazine" as a Church organ; the conference at Hadleigh was due to him; and he seemed to be marked out as chief over "nobodies" like Froude and <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>. His friends objected to the "Tracts" which were the doing of these free lances. <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, however, would not give way. His language about the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> offended Mr. Rose, who held it to be a "deliverance"; and while Froude was eager to dissolve the union of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, which he considered to be the parent or the tool of "Liberalism" in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, he called Rose a "conservative." Between minds thus drawing in opposite directions any real fellowship was not likely to endure. Rose may be termed an auxiliary in the first stage of Church defence; he never was a Tractarian; and he died in 1839. His ally, William Palmer, long survived him. Palmer, an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, learned and pompous, had printed his "Origines Liturgicae" in 1832, a volume now obsolete, but the best book for that period on the Offices of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a>. His later "Treatise on the Church", of 1838, was purely <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> and therefore anti-Roman; it so far won the respect of <a href="../cathen/11702b.htm">Father Perrone, S.J.</a>, that he replied to it.

<p>Palmer was no Tractarian either, as his "Narrative of Events", published in 1843, sufficiently proves. The difference may be sharply stated. Genuine <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> identified the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> once for all with the local body of which they were members, and interpreted the phenomena whether of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> or reformed <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> on this principle; they were Englishmen first and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> after. Not so with <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, who tells us, "I felt affection for my own Church, but not tenderness . . . if <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> once got a footing within her, it was sure of the victory in the event. I saw that <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> principles were powerless to rescue her. As to leaving her, the thought never crossed my <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>; still I ever kept before me that there was something greater than the Established Church, and that was the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic, set up from the beginning, of which she was but the local presence and the organ." These divergent views went at last asunder in 1845.

<p>"The new Tracts," says Dean Church, "were received with surprise, dismay, ridicule, and indignation. But they also at once called forth a response of eager sympathy from numbers." An active propaganda was started all over the country. Bishops were perplexed at so bold a restatement of the <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">Apostolic Succession</a>, in which they hardly believed. <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> affirmed the principle of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>; a visible Church with <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and rites as the channels of invisible grace; a Divinely <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> episcopal system as inculcated by the Epistles of St. Ignatius. But the Erastian or Liberal did not set store by <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>; and the Evangelical found no grace <em>ex opere operato</em> in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Episcopacy to both of them was but a convenient form of Church government, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> association. Now the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who were appointed by Erastians ("an infidel government" is Keble's expression), dreaded the power of Evangelicals. At no time could they dare to support the "Tracts." Moreover, to quote <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, "All the world was astounded at what Froude and I were saying; men said that it was sheer Popery." There were searchings of heart in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, the like of which had not been felt since the <a href="../cathen/11099a.htm">non-jurors</a> went out. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had been emancipated; and "those that sat in the reformers seats were traducing the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>." To add to the confusion, the Liberalizing attack on the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> had now begun. In 1834 Dr. Hampden wrote and sent to <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> his pamphlet, in which he recommended the abolition of tests for Dissenters, or technically, of subscription to the Articles by undergraduates. On what grounds? Because, he said, religion was one thing, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> opinion another. The Trinitarian and <a href="../cathen/15154b.htm">Unitarian</a> doctrines were merely opinions, and the spirit of the English Church was not the spirit of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. Hampden did little more than repeat the well-known arguments of Locke and Chillingworth; but he was breaking open the gates of Oxford to unbelief, as <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> foresaw, and the latter answered wrathfully that Hampden's views made shipwreck of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a>. "Since that time", says the "Apologia", "Phaethon has got into the chariot of the sun; we, alas, can only look on, and watch him down the steep of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." In Mark Pattison's phrase, the University has been secularized. The Noetics of Oriel were followed by the Broad Churchmen of Balliol, and these by the <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">agnostics</a> of a more recent period. From Whateley and Arnold, through the stormy days of "Tract 90" and Ward's "degradation" we come down to the Royal Commission of 1854, which created modern Oxford. Subscription to the Articles was done away; fellowships ceased to be what some one has styled "clerical preserves"; there was an "outbreak of infidelity", says Pattison with a sneer, and names like Arthur Clough, Matthew Arnold, J.A. Froude, Jowett, and Max M&uuml;ller triumphantly declare that the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> had conquered.

<p>Newman lost the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, but he held it entranced for years by his visible greatness, by his preaching, and by his friendships. The sermons, of which eight volumes are extant, afforded a severe yet most persuasive commentary upon tracts and treatises, in themselves always of large outlook and of nervous though formal style. These, annotated after 1870 from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> point of view, were reprinted in "Via Media", "Historical Sketches", "Discussions and Arguments", and two volumes of "Essays" (see popular editions of his Works, 1895). Keble republished Hooker as if an Anglo-Catholic <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Aquinas</a> (finished 1836); and from the chair of poetry were delivered his graceful Latin "Pr&aelig;lections", deeply imbued with the same religious colouring. Hurrell Froude attempted a sketch of his own hero, St. Thomas &agrave; Becket, pattern of all anti-Erastians. Bowden compiled the life of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Pope Gregory VII</a>, evidently for the like motive. Nor were poetical manifestos wanting. To the "Lyra Apostolica" we may attribute a strong influence over many who could not grasp the subtle reasoning which filled <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> "Prophetic Office." Concerning the verses from his pen, A.J. Froude observes that, in spite of their somewhat rude form, "they had pierced into the heart and mind and there remained." "Lead, Kindly Light", he adds, "is perhaps the most popular <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> in the language." Here, indeed, "were thoughts like no other man's thoughts, and emotions like no other man's emotions." To the "Lyra", Keble and others also contributed poems. And High Anglican stories began to appear in print.

<p>But inspiration needed a constant power behind it, if the tracts were not to be a flash in the pan. It was given in 1834 and 1835 by the accession to the movement of E.B. <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Pusey</a>, Canon of Christ Church and Hebrew professor. <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Pusey</a> had enormous erudition, gained in part at German <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>; he was of high social standing (always impressive to Englishmen), and revered as a saint for his devout life, his munificence, his gravity. Though a "dull and tedious preacher", most confused and unrhetorical, the weight of his learning was felt. He took the place that Mr. Rose could not have occupied long. At once the world out of doors looked up to him as official head of the movement. It came to be known as "Puseyism" at home and abroad. University wits had jested about "Newmaniacs" and likened the Vicar of St. Mary's to the conforming <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, Neander; but "Puseyite" was a serious term even in rebuke. The Tractarian leader showed a deference to this "great man" which was always touching; yet they agreed less than <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Pusey</a> understood. Towards <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself the latter felt no drawing; <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> fierceness betrayed the impatience of a thwarted affection. "O that thy creed were sound, thou Church of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>!" he exclaimed in the bitterness of his heart. <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Pusey</a>, always mild, has none of that "hysterical passion." Neither did he regard the judgment of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as decisive, nor was he troubled by them if they ran counter the Fathers teaching, so intimately known to this unwearied student.

<p>He was "a man of large designs", confident in his position, "haunted by no <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> perplexities." He welcomed responsibility, a little too much sometimes; and now he gave the tracts a more important character. His own in 1835 on Holy Baptism was an elaborate treatise, which led to others on a similar model. In 1836 he advertised his great project for a translation or "library" of the Fathers, which was executed mainly in conjunction with the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and eccentric Charles Marriot. The republication of <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> divines, from Andrewes onwards, likewise owed its inception to <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Pusey</a>. The <em>instauratio magna</em> of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and devotion, intended to be purely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, thus made a beginning. It has taken on it since the largest dimensions, and become not only learned but popular; <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> experts have treated the liturgy, <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, books for guidance in the spiritual life, <a href="../cathen/07596a.htm">hymnology</a>, architecture and ritual with a copious <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and remarkable success. Of these enterprises <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Dr. Pusey</a> was the source and for many years the standard.

<p>In 1836 Hurrell Froude, returning from Barbadoes in the last stage of weakness, died at his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> house in Devonshire. His "Remains", of which we shall speak presently, were published in 1837. <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> dearest friend was taken from him just as a fresh scene opened, with alarums and excursions to be repeated during half a century &#151; legal "persecutions", acts of reprisals, fallings away on the right hand and the left. Froude died on 28 February, 1836. In May Dr. Hampden &#151; who had been appointed, thanks to Whateley, Regius Professor of Divinity on 7 Feb. &#151; was censured by the heads of houses, the governing board of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, for the unsound <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> taught in his "Bampton Lectures". All the Oxford residents at this time, except a handful, were <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensed</a> by what they considered the perils to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which Dr. Hampden's <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">free-thought</a> was provoking. But it was <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> who, by his "Elucidations", pointed the charge, and gave to less learned combatants an excuse for condemning what the had not read. Nemesis lay in wait on his threshold. The Evangelicals who trooped into Convocation to vote against Hampden "avowed their desire that the next time they were brought up to <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, it might be to put down the Popery of the Movement."

<p>At this date even <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Pusey</a> celebrated the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> as "the founders of our Church"; and that largely fabulous account of the past which <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> calls "the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> tradition" was believed on all sides. Imagine, then, how shocked and alarmed were old-fashioned parsons of every type when Froude's letters and diaries upset "with amazing audacity" these "popular and conventional estimates"; when the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was described as "a limb badly set", its <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a> Jewel flung aside as "an irreverent Dissenter", its reasoning against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mysteries denounced as the fruit of a proud spirit which would make short work of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> itself. Froude, in his graphic correspondence, appeared to be the <em>enfant terrible</em> who had no reserves and no respect for "idols" whether of the market-place or the theatre. Friends were pained, foes exultant; "sermons and newspapers", says Dean Church, "drew attention to Froude's extravagances with horror and disgust." The editors, Keble no less than <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, had miscalculated the effect, which was widely irritating and which increased the suspicion their own writings had excited of some deep-laid plot in favour of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Letter to Faussett, June, 1835). To be at once imprudent and insidious might seem beyond man's power; but such was the reputation Tractarians bore from that day. Froude's outspoken judgments, however, marked the turning of the tide in <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>. "The divines of the Reformation", continues Dean Church, "never can be again, with their confused <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>, with their shifting opinions, their extravagant deference to the foreign oracles of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> and Zurich, their subservience to bad men in power, the heroes and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of Churchmen." Since Cobbet's indictment of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> no language had so stirred the rage of "general ignorance", long content to take its legends on trust. Froude's "Remains" were a challenge to it in one way, as the "Library of the Fathers" was in another, and yet again the ponderous "Catenas" of High Church authorities, to which by and by the "Parker Society" answered with its sixty-six volumes, mostly unreadable, of the Cranmer, Bullinger and Zurich pattern. The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> was doomed. What the "Anglican regiment" has accomplished, J.A. Froude proclaims, "is the destruction of the Evangelical party in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a>."

<p>When Samson pulled down the temple of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, he was buried in its ruins. <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> did not shrink from that sacrifice; he was ready to strike and be stricken. Though Hampden's condemnation would never have been carried by the Tractarians alone, they gave it a force and an edge in the very spirit of Laud. To put down <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> teachers by authority, to visit them with penalties of censure and deprivation, they held was the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and of the State as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> minister. They would have repealed Catholic Emancipation. They resisted the grant to the College of Maynooth. They had saved the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> Book from amendments, and frightened politicians, who would have distributed the spoils of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> among more or less "Liberal" schemes. By the year 1838 they had won their place in Oxford; the "Times" was coming over to their side; Bampton Lectures were beginning to talk of <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Catholic tradition</a> as the practical <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>; and Evangelicals, infuriated if not dismayed, were put on their defence. Whateley from <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, Hawkins, Faussett, Hampden, Golightly, in <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, were calling up a motley array, united on one point only, that Tractarians must be handled as the emissaries of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Dr. Arnold in the Edinburgh launched an invective against the "Oxford Malignants", accusing them of "moral dishonesty." <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> former friend, Whateley, shrieked over "this rapidly increasing pestilence", and transfixed its leaders with epithets; they were "veiled <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>"; their religion was "Thuggee"; they were working out "infidel designs." Lord Morpeth in the House of Commons trampled on "a sect of damnable and detestable heretics lately sprung up at Oxford", and mentioned <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> by name. From every quarter of the compass a storm was blowing up; but it moved round a thunder cloud called "Rome".

<p>"Just at this time, June, 1838", says <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, "was the zenith of the Tract Movement." A change of fortune began with his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> charge, animadverting lightly on its Roman tendencies, to which the answer came at once from <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, that if it was desired he would suppress the tracts. It was not asked of him; but he had written to Bowden the significant words, "I do not see how the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can materially alter his charge or how I can bear any blow whatever." Some of his friends objected to publishing the tract on the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a>; for it was not then realized how much the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> Book owes to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, i.e. to Latin and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> sources. <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> impatiently rejoined that they must have confidence in him. To Keble he disclosed his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of giving up the tracts, the "British Critic", and St. Mary's. For while preaching High Anglican <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, he said, "one cannot stop still. Shrewd minds anticipate conclusions, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">oblige</a> one to say yes or no." He collected in January, 1839, "all the strong things" which he and others had flung out against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and made of them "advertisements" to the <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Puseyite</a> publications. By way of protest on the <a href="../cathen/09399a.htm">Low Church</a> side, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> united in the Martyrs Memorial to Cranmer and Latimer, set up near the spot where they suffered, in front of Balliol College. But the tracts were selling faster than the printers could meet the demand. In July, <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, taking up again his always projected and never issued edition of <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a>, plunged into the record of the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>. In September he wrote to F. Rogers, "I have had the first real hit from Romanism"; an allusion to <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman's</a> telling article on the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in the "Dublin" for August. Walking with <a href="../cathen/15620b.htm">H. Wilberforce</a> in the New Forest he made to him the "astounding confidence" that <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> was upon him, thanks to "the position of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> controversy, and the principle 'Securis judicat orbit terrarum' in that of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>." A vista had opened to the end of which he did not see. His mind was never settled again in <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicanism</a>. "He has told the story with so keen a feeling of its tragic and pathetic character", as Dean Church truly says, "that it will never cease to be read where the English language is spoken." It was the story of a deliverance. But still Samson paid for it with all he held dear.

<p>Parallels from antiquity might affect a student like <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>. To the many, inside or beyond Oxford, they meant nothing. The live question always was, how to combat <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which appeared at the end of every vista as the goal of Tractarian reasoning. The "shrewd minds" which now harried and drove on their leader did not take to any "middle way"; these men cut into the movement at right angles and sang loudly <em>Tendimus in Latium</em>, they were <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> to St. Peter's shrine. <a href="../cathen/10577a.htm">J.B. Morris</a>, <a href="../cathen/04604b.htm">Dalgairns</a>, <a href="../cathen/11173a.htm">Oakeley</a>, Macmullen (converts in the sequel), came round <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> while his older associates had not advanced. But the captain of the band was <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">W.G. Ward</a>, lecturer at Balliol, a friend of Stanley's and for a time attracted by Arnold, then suddenly changed for the good by the sermons at St. Mary's, with his one sole <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a>, <em>Credo in Newmannum.</em> <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">Ward</a>, a strange, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyous</a>, provoking figure, pervading the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> with his <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> and his jokes, was the <em>enfant terrible</em> of this critical time as Froude had been previously. They differed in a hundred ways; but both certainly urged <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> forward at a pace he would not have chosen. Froude "did not seem to be afraid of inferences"; <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">Ward</a> revelled in them. It was Froude who first taught <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> "to look with admiration towards the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>." <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">Ward</a>, of all men the least inclined to compromise, did not care one jot for the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a>, except insofar as it could be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, by which he understood, as <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> did before him, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and discipline of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> communion. He had "the intellect of an archangel", as he said ingenuously; his acuteness and audacity were a continual challenge to <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, who partly resented but still more yielded to them; and so the problem took a formidable shape: how much on "infused <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>" would the Establishment bear. It was "like proving cannon." The crucial test was applied in "Tract 90", which came out on 27 February, 1841. Once more, as in the case of Froude's "Remains", <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> miscalculated. He had drifted so far that he lost sight of the ever-enduring <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> which, to this day, is the bulwark of the national feeling against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He thought his peace-offering would not cause offence. But <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">Ward</a> prophesied, and his <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that it would "be hotly received." A lively epistle from Church (afterwards Dean of St. Paul s) to F. Rogers at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> shows the storm raging early in March. What "Tract 90" affirmed was that the Thirty-Nine Articles might be signed in a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, though not in a Roman sense; that they did not condemn the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, which in 1562, the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of their publication, was not ended; and that a distinction must be drawn between the corruptions of popular religion and the formal decrees approved by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. It is now admitted, in the language of J.A. Froude, that "Newman was only claiming a position for himself and his friends which had purposely left open when the constitution of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> was framed." But he appeared to be an innovator and, in that excited season, a traitor. The <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> held him bound by his own cords; Erastians or Evangelicals, they well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> would not shield him from attack. Four leading tutors, egged on by the fanatical Golightly, and including A.C. Tait, afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, demanded the writer's name and charged him with dangerous tendencies. The hebdomadal board now retorted on <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> the "persecution" dealt out on Hampden. They would not wait even twelve hours for his defence. They resolved on 15 March, that "modes of interpretation such as are suggested in the said Tract, evading rather than explaining the sense of the Thirty-nine Article, and reconciling subscription to them with the adoption of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, which they were designed to counteract, defeat the object, and are inconsistent with the due observance of the above mentioned Statutes."

<p>This <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> was posted up on every buttery hatch, or public board, of the colleges, as a warning to undergraduates. <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> acknowledged his authorship in a touching letter, perhaps too <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>; and a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of pamphlets broke out. Keble, Palmer, and <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Pusey</a> stood up for the tract, though <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Pusey</a> could not bring himself to approve of its method unconditionally. But <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">Ward</a>, with great effect, hurled back the charge of "insincerity" on those who made it. How could Whateley and Hampden use the services for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, visitation of the sick, or <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, all dead against their acknowledged principles? But neither did <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">Ward</a> follow <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>. Later on, he described the articles as "patient of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> but ambitious of a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> meaning." Whatever their <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, their rhetoric was undoubtedly <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. For himself, in subscribing them, he renounced no Roman <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. This, like all Ward's proceedings, was pouring oil on fire. <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> had made the mistake of handling an explosive matter without precaution, in the dry legal fashion of an advocate, instead of using his his incomparable gift of language to persuade and convince. His refinements were pilloried as "Jesuitism", and his motive was declared to be treason. An immense commotion followed. The "Apologia" describes it, "In every part of the country, and every class of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, through every organ and opportunity of opinion, in newspapers, in periodicals, at meetings, in <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpits</a>, at dinner-tables, in coffee-rooms, in railway-carriages, I was denounced as a traitor who had laid his train, and was detected in the very act of firing it against the time-honoured Establishment." His place in the movement was gone.

<p>He would not withdraw the tract; he reiterated its arguments in a Letter to Dr. Jeff; but at his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> request he brought the series to an end, addressing him in a strikingly beautiful pamphlet, which severed his own connection with the party he had led. He retired to Littlemore; and there, he says, "between July and November I received three blows that broke me." First, in translating St. Athanasius, he came on the Via Media once more; but it was that of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a>. Second, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, contrary to an "understanding" given him, began to charge <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a>, as of set purpose, against "Tract 90", which they accused of Romanizing and dishonesty. Last came the unholy alliance between <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> by which an <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> Bishop was appointed at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> over a flock comprising, it would appear, not only <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> but Druses and other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. The "Confession of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>" was to be their standard. Now, "if <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> could be in Palestine, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> might be in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>." The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> might have the Apostolical Succession; so had the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>; but such acts led <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> to suspect that since the sixteenth century it had never been a Church at all.

<p>Now then he was a "pure Protestant", held back from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> simply by its apparent <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatries</a>. Or were these but developments, after all of the primitive type and really <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to it? He had converted <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">Ward</a> by saying that "the Church of the Fathers might be corrupted into Popery, never into <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>." Did not living institutions undergo changes by a law of their being that realized their nature more perfectly? and was the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> an instance? At Littlemore the great book was to be composed "On the Development of Christian Doctrine", which viewed this problem in the light of history and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> resigned St. Mary's in September, 1843. He waited two years in lay communion before submitting to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and fought every step of the journey. Meanwhile the movement went on. Its "acknowledged leader" according to Dean Stanley was now <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">W.G. Ward</a>. On pure <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> a strong influence was exerted by J.B. Mozley, <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> brother-in-law. Keble, who was at odds with his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, vacated the chair of poetry; and the Tractarian candidate, Isaac Williams, was defeated in January, 1842. Williams had innocently roused slumbering animosities by his "Tract 80", on "Reserve in communicating religious knowledge", a warning, as ever since, <a href="../cathen/09399a.htm">Low Church</a> partisans have maintained, that the Establishment was to be secretly indoctrinated with "Romish <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>." The heads of houses now proposed to repeal their censure of 1836 on Hampden, though he withdrew not a line of his Bampton Lectures. It was too much. Convocation threw out the measure by a majority of three to two. Hampden, by way of revenge, turned the formal examination of a <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Puseyite</a>, Macmullen of Corpus, for the B.D. into a demand for assent to propositions which, as he well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, Macmullen could not sign. The vice-chancellor backed up Hampden; but the Delegates reversed that iniquitous judgment and gave the candidate his degree. The spirit of faction was mounting high. Young men's testimonials for orders were refused by their colleges. A statute was brought up in February, 1844, to place the granting of all divinity degrees under a board in conjunction with the vice-chancellor, which would mean the exclusion from them of Tractarians. This, indeed, was rejected by 341 votes to 21. But <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> had said a year earlier, that the authorities were bent on exerting their "more than military power" to put down <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. R. W. Church calls them an irresponsible and incompetent oligarchy. Their chiefs were such as Hawkins, Symons, and Cardwell, bitterly opposed to the movement all through. As <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> had retired, they struck at <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Pusey</a>; and by a <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> inquisition of "the six <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>" they suspended him, without hearing a word of his defence, from preaching for two years, 2 June, 1843. His crime consisted in a moderate <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> sermon on the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>.

<p>Espionage, delation, quarrels between heads and tutors, rejection of <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Puseyites</a> standing for fellowships, and a heated suspicion as though a second Popish Plot were in the air, made this time at Oxford a drama which Dean Church likens to the Greek faction-fights described by Thucydides. The situation could not last. A crisis might have been avoided by good sense on the part of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> outside, and the ruling powers within the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. It was precipitated by <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">W.G. Ward</a>. Ejected from his lectureship at Balliol, he wrote violent articles between 1841 and 1843 in the "British Critic", no longer in <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> hands. His conversation was a combat; his words of scorn for <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> doctrines and dignitaries flew round the colleges. In 1843 Palmer of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> in his dreary "Narrative of Events" objected strongly to Ward's "Romanizing" tendencies. The "British Critic" just then came to an end. <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">Ward</a> began a pamphlet in reply; it swelled to 600 pages, and in the summer of 1844 burst on an irritated public as "The Ideal of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Church."

<p>Its method was simple. The writer identified all that was Roman with all that was <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>; and proceeded to apply this test to the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a>, which could ill bear it. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> satisfied the conditions of what a Church ought to be; the Establishment shamefully neglected its <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as a "guardian of morality" and a "teacher of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>." It ignored the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>; it allowed ethics to be thrown overboard by its <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of justification without works; it had no real Saints because it neither commended nor practised the counsels of perfection; it was a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> body which ought humbly to sue for pardon at the feet of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Bride of Christ. To evade the spirit of the Articles while subscribing them, where <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, in a "non-natural" sense, was the only alternative <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">Ward</a> could allow to breaking with <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicanism</a> altogether. Unlike <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, who aimed at reconciling differences, and to whom the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> formula was but "a paradox or a truism", <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">Ward</a> repudiated the "solifidian" view as an outrage on the Divine <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>; it was "a type of Antichrist", and in sound reason no better than <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">Atheism</a>. So his "relentless and dissolving <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>" made any Via Media between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> impossible. The very heart of the Elizabethan compromise he plucked out. His language was diffuse, his style heavy, his manner to the last degree provoking. But whereas "Tract 90" did not really state, and made no attempt to resolve, the question at issue, Ward's "Ideal" swept away ambiguous terms and hollow reconcilements; it contrasted, however clumsily, the types of saintliness which were in dispute; it claimed for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> standard not toleration, but supremacy; and it put the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a> on its knees before <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>How could Oxford or the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> endure such a lesson? So complete a change of attitude on the part of <a href="../cathen/05431b.htm">Englishmen</a>, haughtily erect on the ruins of the old religion, was not to be dreamt of. This, then, was what "Tract 90" had in view with its subtleties and subterfuges a second <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a> absolving the nation as it lay in the dust, penitent. The result, says Dean Stanley, was "the greatest explosion of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> apprehension and animosity" known to his time. Not even the tract had excited a more immediate or a more powerful sensation. Ward's challenge must be taken up. He claimed, as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a>, to hold (though not as yet to teach) the "whole cycle of Roman <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>." <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> had never done so; even in 1844 he was not fully acquiescent on all the points he had once controverted. He would never have written the "Ideal"; much of it to him read like a theory. But in Oxford the authorities, who were acting as if with synodical powers, submitted to Convocation in Dec. 1844, three measures: <ul><li>to condemn Ward's book; <li>to degrade the author by taking away his <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> degrees; and <li>to compel under pain of expulsion, every one who subscribed the Articles to declare that he held them in the sense in which "they were both first published and were now imposed by the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>."</ul>

<p>Had the penalty on <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">Ward</a>, vindictive and childish as it now appears, stood alone, few would have minded it. Even <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> wrote in January, 1845, to J.B. Mozley, "Before the Test was sure of rejection, <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">Ward</a> had no claims on anyone." But over that "Test" a wild shriek arose. <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> would be affected by it as surely as Tractarians. Tait, one of the "Four Tutors", Maurice, the broadest of Broad Churchmen, Professor Donkin, most <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> of writers belonging to the same <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, came forward to resist the imposition and to shield "Tract 90", on the principle of "Latitude". Stanley and another obtained counsel's opinion from a future lord chancellor the Test was illegal. On 23 January, they published his conclusion, and that very day the proposal was withdrawn. But on 25 January, the date in 1841 of "Tract 90" itself, a formal censure on the tract, to be brought up in the approaching Convocation, was recommended to voters by a circular emanating from Faussett and Ellerton. This <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> received between four and five hundred signatures in private, but was kept behind the scenes until 4 Feb. The hebdomadal board, in a frenzy of excitement, adopted it amid protests from the <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Puseyites</a> and from <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> of Stanley's type. Stanley's words during the tumult made a famous hit. In a broadside he exclaimed, "The wheel is come full circle. The victors of 1836 are the victims of 1845. The victims of 1845 are the victors of 1836. The assailants are the assailed. The assailed are the assailants. The condemned are the condemners. The condemners are the condemned. The wheel is come full circle. How soon may it come round again?" A comment on this "fugitive prophecy" was to be afforded in the Gorham case, in that of "Essays and Reviews," in the dispute over Colenso, and in the long and vexatious lawsuits arising out of Ritualism. The endeavour was made to break every <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in succession on this wheel, but always at length in vain.

<p>Convocation met in a snowstorm on 13 February, 1845. It was the last day of the Oxford Movement. <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">Ward</a> asked to defend himself in English before the vast assembly which crowded into the Sheldonian Theatre. He spoke with vigour and ability, declaring "twenty times over" that he held all the articles of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. Amid cries and counter-cries the votes were taken. The first, which condemned his "Ideal", was carried by 777 to 386. The second, which deprived him of <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> standing, by 569 to 511. When the vice-chancellor put the third, which was to annihilate <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> and "Tract 90", the proctors rose, and in a voice that rang like a trumpet Mr. Guillemard of Trinity, the senior, uttered their "Non placet". This was fatal to the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, and in the event to that oligarchy which had long ruled over Oxford. <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> gave no sign. But his reticence boded nothing good to the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> cause. The University repudiated his followers and they broke into detachments, the many lingering behind with Keble or <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Pusey</a>; others, and among them Mark Pattison, a tragic instance, lapsing into various forms of modern unbelief; while the genuine Roman group, Faber, <a href="../cathen/04604b.htm">Dalgairns</a>, <a href="../cathen/11173a.htm">Oakeley</a>, <a href="../cathen/11111a.htm">Northcote</a>, Seager, Morris and a long stream of successors, became <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. They left the Liberal party to triumph in <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a> and to remould the University. If 13 February, 1845 was the "Dies Irae" of Tractarian hopes, it saw the final discomfiture of the Evangelicals. Henceforth, all parties in the National Church were compelled to "revise the very foundations of their religion." Dogma had taken refuge in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>In April, 1845, the country was excited by Sir R. Peel's proposals for the larger endowment of Maynooth (see Macaulay's admirable speech on the occasion). In June, Sir H. Jenner Fust, Dean of <a href="../cathen/01695a.htm">Arches</a>, condemned <a href="../cathen/11173a.htm">Oakeley</a> of Margaret Street <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> for holding the like doctrines with <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">Ward</a>, who was already married and early in September was received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> resigned his Oriel fellowship, held since 1822, at the beginning of October. He did not wait to finish the "Development"; but on the feast of St. Denys, 9 October, made his profession of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/05113a.htm">Father Dominic</a> at Littlemore. The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a> "reeled under the shock." Deep silence, as of stupor, followed the clamours and long agonies of the past twelve years. The Via Media swerved aside, becoming less theoretical and less learned, always wavering between the old <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> and the new Roman road, but gradually drawing nearer to the Roman. Its headquarters were in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, <a href="../cathen/09112a.htm">Leeds</a> and Brighton, no longer in Oxford.

<p>But an "aftermath" of disputes, and of conversions in the year 1851, remains to be noticed. On 15 November, 1847, the Prime Minister, Lord John Russell, nominated to the <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">See of Hereford</a>, the "stormy petrel" of those controversies, Dr. Hampden. He did so "to strengthen the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> character of our Church, threatened of late by many defections to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>." The "Times" expresses amazement; Archbishop Howley and thirteen other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> remonstrated; but <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Dr. Pusey</a> was "the leader and <a href="../cathen/11264c.htm">oracle</a> of Hampden's opponents." At Oxford the Heads of Houses were mostly in favour of the nominee, though lying under censure since 1836. An attempt was made to object at Bow Church when the election was to be confirmed; but the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> had no freedom, and by <em>cong&eacute; d'&eacute;lire</em> and exercise of the Royal Supremacy a <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notoriously</a> unsound teacher became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a>, It was the case of Hoadley in a modern form.

<p>Almost at the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> (2 November, 1847) the Rev. G. C. Gorham, "an aged Calvinist", was presented to the living of Brampton Speke in Devonshire. "Henry of <a href="../cathen/05708a.htm">Exeter</a>", the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, holding High Anglican views, examined him at length on the subject of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> regeneration, and finding that he did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in it, refused to induct Mr. Gorham. The case went to the <a href="../cathen/01695a.htm">Court of Arches</a> &mdash; a spiritual court where Sir H. Jenner Fust decided against the appellant, 2 August, 1849. Mr. Gorham carried a further appeal to the judicial committee, the lay royal tribunal, which reversed the decision of the spiritual court below. Dr. Philpotts, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05708a.htm">Exeter</a>, refused to institute; and the dean of arches was compelled to do so instead. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> tried every other court in vain; for a while he broke off communion, so far as he dared, with Canterbury. As <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> had won at <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a>, so <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> won at Brampton Speke.

<p>These decisions of the Crown in Council affected matters of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> most intimately. <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> lectures on "Anglican Difficulties" were drawn forth by the Gorham judgment. But <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Pusey</a>, Keble, Gladstone, and Anglo-Catholics at large were dumbfounded. <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning</a>, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/03657a.htm">Chichester</a>, had neither written tracts nor joined in <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> proceedings. He did not scruple to take part with the general public though in measured terms, against "Tract 90". He had gone so far as to preach an out-and-out <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> sermon in St. Mary's on Guy Fawkes day, 1843. In 1845 he "attacked the Romanizing party so fiercely as to call forth a remonstrance from <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Pusey</a>." And then came a change. He read <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> "Development," had a serious illness, travelled in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, spent a season in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and lost his <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> defences. The Gorham judgment was a demonstration that lawyers could override spiritual authority, and that the English Church neither held nor condemned <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> regeneration. This gave him the finishing stroke. In the summer of 1850, a solemn declaration, calling in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to repudiate the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> thus implied, was signed by <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning</a>, <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Pusey</a>, Keble and other leading High Anglicans; but with no result, save only that a secession followed on the part of those who could not imagine <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christ's Church</a> as tolerating <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.On 6 April, 1851, <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning</a> and J. R. Hope Scott came over. <a href="../cathen/01323b.htm">Allies</a>, a scholar of repute, had submitted in 1849, distinctly on the question now agitated of the royal headship. Maskell, Dodsworth, Badeley, the two <a href="../cathen/15620b.htm">Wilberforces</a>, did in like manner. <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Pusey</a> cried out for freedom from the State; Keble took a non-juring position, "if the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a> were to fail, it should be found in my <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>." Gladstone would not sign the declaration; and he lived to write against the Vatican decrees.

<p>Surveying the movement as a whole we perceive that it was part of the general <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> uprising which the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> called forth. It had many features in common with German Romanticism; and, like the policy of a Free Church eloquently advocated by <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Lamennais</a>, it made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on the old servitude to the State and looked for support to the people. Against <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">free-thought</a>, speculative and anarchic, it pleaded for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> as a sacred fact, a revelation from on high, and a present <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> power. Its especial task was to restore the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, above all the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>. In the Laudian tradition, though fearfully weakened, it sought a fulcrum and a precedent for these happier changes.

<p><a href="../cathen/09554a.htm">Joseph de Maistre</a>, in the year 1816, had called attention to the English Church, designating it as a middle term between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> dissent; with an augury of its future as perhaps one day serving towards the <a href="../cathen/15132a.htm">reunion of Christendom</a>. Alexander Knox foretold a like destiny, but the Establishment must be purged by suffering. Bishop Horsley, too, had anticipated such a time in remarkable words. But the most striking prophecy was uttered by an aged <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, Mr. Sikes of Guilsborough, who predicted that, whereas "the Holy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>" had long been a dropped article of the Creed, it would by and by seem to swallow up the rest, and there would be an outcry of "Popery" from one end of the country to another (Newman's "Correspondence", II, 484). When the tracts began, <a href="../cathen/04698c.htm">Phillips de Lisle</a> saw in them an assurance that <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> would return to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. And J.A. Froude sums it all up in these words, "Newman has been the voice of the intellectual reaction of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>", he says, "which was alarmed by an era of revolutions, and is looking for safety in the forsaken <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> of ages which it had been tempted to despise."

<p>Later witnesses, <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a> or W.E. Gladstone, affirm that the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a> is transformed. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>, devotions, rites, and institutions flourish within it. But its law of public worship is too narrow for its <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, and the machinery for discipline has broken down (Royal Commission on Discipline, concluding words). The condemnation of <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">Anglican Orders</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Apostolicae Curae", 13 September, 1896, shuts out the hope entertained by some of what was termed "corporate reunion", even if it had ever been possible, which Newman did not believe. But he never <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> that the movement of 1833 was a work of Providence; or that its leaders, long after his own departure from them, were "leavening the various English denominations and parties (far beyond their own range) with principles and sentiments tending towards their ultimate absorption into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>."
