<h1>The Passion of Christ in the Four Gospels</h1>  

<p><em>See also</em> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">DEVOTION TO THE PASSION OF CHRIST</a>.

<p>We have in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> four separate accounts of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Our Lord</a>, each of which supplements the others, so that only from a careful examination and comparison of all can we arrive at a full and clear <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the whole story. The <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">first three Gospels</a> resemble each other very closely in their general plan, so closely indeed that some sort of literary connection among them may be assumed; but the <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">fourth Gospel</a>, although the writer was evidently familiar at least with the general tenor of the story told by the other three, gives us an independent narrative.

<p>If we begin by marking in any one of the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptic Gospels</a> those verses which occur in substance in both of the other two, and then read these verses continuously, we shall find that we have in them a brief but a complete narrative of the whole passion story. There are of course very few details, but all the essentials of the story are there. In <a href="../cathen/09674b.htm">St. Mark's Gospel</a> the marked verses will be as follows: xiv, 1, 10-14, 16-18, 21-23, 26, 30, 32, 35-6, 41, 43, 45, 47-9, 53-4, 65 to xv, 2, 9, 11-15, 21-2, 26-7, 31-33, 37-9, 41, 43, 46-7. Verbal alterations would be required to make the verses run consecutively. Sometimes the division will not quite coincide with the verse. It is possible that this nucleus, out of which our present accounts seem to have grown, represents more or less exactly some original and more ancient narrative, whether written or merely oral matters little, compiled in the earliest days at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. This original narrative, so far as we can judge from what is common to all the three <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptics</a>, included the betrayal, the preparation of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Paschal Supper</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a> with a brief account of the institution of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">Agony in the Garden</a>, the arrest and taking of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> before <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiphas</a>, with His examination there and condemnation for <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. Then follow Peter's denials, and the taking of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> before <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>. Next comes <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> question: "Art thou the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">king of the Jews</a>?" and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> answer, "Thou sayest it", with <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> endeavour to set Him free on account of the feast, frustrated by the demand of the people for Barabbas. After this <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> weakly yields to their insistence and, having <a href="../cathen/06092a.htm">scourged</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, hands Him over to be crucified. The story of the Crucifixion itself is a short one. It is confined to the casting of lots for the garments, the accusation over the head, the mocking of the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> darkness, and the rending of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple</a> veil. After the death we have the confession of the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a>, the begging of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> from <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, and the burial of it, wrapped in a clean linen cloth, in <a href="../cathen/08520a.htm">Joseph's</a> new <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> hewn out in the rock close by.

<p>In order to distinguish what is peculiar to each <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> we must notice a remarkable series of additional passages which are found both in <a href="../cathen/10057a.htm">St. Matthew</a> and <a href="../cathen/09674b.htm">St. Mark</a>. There are no similar coincidences between <a href="../cathen/10057a.htm">St. Matthew</a> and <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">St. Luke</a>, or between <a href="../cathen/09674b.htm">St. Mark</a> and <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">St. Luke</a>. These passages taken as they occur in <a href="../cathen/09674b.htm">St. Mark</a>, are as follows: <a href="../bible/mar014.htm">Mark 14:15, 19-20, 24-28, 31, 33-4, 37-40, 42, 44, 46, 50-2, 55-8, 60-4</a>; <a href="../bible/mar015.htm">15:3-8, 10, 16-20, 23-4, 29-30, 34-6, 40, 42</a>. They have the character rather of expansions than of additions. Still some of them are of considerable importance, for instance, the mocking of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> by the soldiers in the Pr&aelig;torium, and the cry from the Cross, "My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why hast thou forsaken me?" Possibly this series also formed part of an original narrative omitted by <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">St. Luke</a>, who had a wealth of special information on the Passion. Another explanation would be that <a href="../cathen/09674b.htm">St. Mark</a> expanded the original narrative, and that his work was then used by <a href="../cathen/10057a.htm">St. Matthew</a>. The passages found in <a href="../cathen/09674b.htm">St. Mark</a> alone are quite unimportant. The story of the young man who fled naked has very generally been felt to be a personal reminiscence. Mark alone speaks of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple</a> as "made with hands", and he is also the only one to note that the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witnesses were not in agreement one with another. He mentions also that Simon the Cyrenian was "father of Alexander and of Rufus", no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> because these names were well known to those for whom he was writing. Lastly, he is the only one who records the fact that <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> asked for <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. In <a href="../cathen/10057a.htm">St. Matthew's Gospel</a> the peculiarities are more numerous and of a more distinctive character. Naturally in his Gospel, written for a <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> circle of readers, there is insistence on the position of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> as the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>. There are several fresh episodes possessing distinctive and marked characteristics. They include the washing of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> hands, the dream of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> wife, and the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> after the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, with the earthquake and the rending of the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a>. The special features by which <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">St. Luke's</a> passion narrative is distinguished are very numerous and important. Just as <a href="../cathen/10057a.htm">St. Matthew</a> emphasizes the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> character, so <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">St. Luke</a> lays stress on the universal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> manifested by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, and sets forth the Passion as the great act by which the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> was accomplished. He is the only one who records the statement of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> that he found no cause in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>; and also the examination before <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>. He alone tells us of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who came to strengthen <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in his <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">agony in the garden</a>, and, if the reading is right, of the drops of blood which mingled with the sweat which trickled down upon the ground. To <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">St. Luke</a> again we owe our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of no less than three of the seven words from the Cross: the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for His murderers; the episode of the penitent thief; and the last utterance of all, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit". Finally it is <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">St. Luke</a> alone who tells us of the effect produced upon the spectators, who so short a time before had been so full of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, and how they returned home "striking their breasts".

<p>The traditional character of the <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">Fourth Gospel</a> as having been written at a later date than the other three, and after they had become part of the religious possession of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> generally, is entirely borne out by a study of the passion. Although almost all the details of the story are new, and the whole is drawn up on a plan owing nothing to the common basis of the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptists</a>, yet a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what they had written is presupposed throughout, and is almost <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> before this later presentment of the Gospel can be fully understood. Most important events, fully related in the earlier Gospels, are altogether omitted in the Fourth, in a way which would be very perplexing had we not thus the key. For instance, there is no mention of the institution of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">agony in the garden</a>, or the trial and condemnation before <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiphas</a>. On the other hand, we have a great number of facts not contained in the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptists</a>. For instance, the eagerness of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> to release <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> and his final yielding only to a definite threat from the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> leaders; the presence of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">our Lady</a> at the foot of the Cross, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus'</a> last charge to her and to <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John</a>. Most important of all perhaps, is the piercing of the side by the soldier's spear and the flowing forth of blood and water. It is <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">St. John</a> alone, again, who tells us of the order to break the legs of all, and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ's</a> legs were not broken, because he was already dead.

<p>There seems at first sight a discrepancy between the narrative of the <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">Fourth Gospel</a> and that of the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptists</a>, namely, as to the exact day of the crucifixion, which involves the question whether the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a> was or was not, in the strict sense, the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Paschal</a> meal. If we had the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptists</a> only we should almost certainly decide that it was, for they speak of preparing the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a>, and give no hint that the meal which they describe was anything else. But <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">St. John</a> seems to labour to show that the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Paschal</a> meal itself was not to be eaten till the next day. He points out that the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> would not enter the court of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, because they feared pollution which might prevent them from eating the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a>. He is so clear that we can hardly mistake his meaning, and certain passages in the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptists</a> seem really to point in the same direction. <a href="../cathen/08520a.htm">Joseph</a>, for instance, was able to buy the linen and the spices for the burial, which would not have been possible on the actual <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast-day</a>. Moreover, one passage, which at first sight seems strongest in the other direction, has quite another meaning when the reading is corrected. "With desire I have desired", said <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, "to eat this <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a> with you, before I suffer. For I say to you, that from this time, I will not eat it, till it be fulfilled in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>" (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#vrs15">Luke 22:15</a>). When the hour for it had fully come He would have been already dead, the type would have passed away, and the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a> would have already come.
