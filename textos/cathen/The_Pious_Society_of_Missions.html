<h1>The Pious Society of Missions</h1>  

<p>Founded by <a href="../cathen/11429a.htm">Ven. Vincent Mary Pallotti</a> in 1835. The members of the society are generally called Pallottini Fathers. Its object is to preserve the Faith among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, especially among emigrants, who are exposed to many grave dangers, and to propagate the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> among non-Catholics and infidels.

<p>The Society of Missions embraces three classes: (1) <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and lay-brothers; (2) sisters, who help the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in their missionary works as teachers and catechists, and who care for the temporal necessities of their churches and houses; (3) affiliated <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and lay people. The sisters live a community life, and follow the Rule of St. Francis. They dedicate themselves to the spiritual and temporal welfare of their sex. They are especially engaged in missionary work among the emigrants in America, and the infidels in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> and Australia. The third class consists of both the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> who are affiliated with the Society of Missions and help by their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, works, and financial aid the propagation of the Faith.

<p>The founder prescribed that his <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> should be a medium between the secular and the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. He desired to foster the work of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Apostolate. This desire of his was strikingly symbolized by the annual celebration of the octave (which he inaugurated in 1836) and the feast of Epiphany in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (see <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">VINCENT MARY PALOTTI</a>). He gave to his <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> the name of "Catholic Apostolate", afterwards changed by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> to the "Pious Society of Missions". The word <em>Pious</em> is to be taken in the sense of the Latin <em>pia</em>, i.e., devoted or dedicated to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On 9 Jan., 1835, <a href="../cathen/11429a.htm">Pallotti</a> conceived the plan of his institute and submitted it to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, and received the required <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> through the cardinal vicar, <a href="../cathen/11206b.htm">Odescalchi</a>, on 4 April, 1835, as again by another <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> on 29 May, and finally by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a> on 14 July of the same year. Nearly all <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and communities favoured the newly-created institute with a share in all their spiritual works and <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. In the first years of its existence the Pious Society of Missions had among its affiliated members, twenty-five <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Roman princes, and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities and <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, as also men known in that time as great apostles, Blessed Caspar del Buffalo, the founder of the <a href="../cathen/12373c.htm">Congregation of the Most Precious Blood</a> and Maria Clausi of the Order of <a href="../cathen/06231a.htm">St. Francis of Paula</a>. For a time the <a href="../cathen/12461a.htm">Society of the Propagation of Faith</a> in Lyons feared that the new <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> would interfere with its special work. <a href="../cathen/11429a.htm">Pallotti</a> satisfied the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> that the purpose of his <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was different from that of the Propagation. As the name, "Catholic Apostolate", occasioned objections in some quarters, it was changed to the "Pious Society of Missions".

<p>At the <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> near <a href="../cathen/06243a.htm">Frascati</a>, he wrote the constitution and rules for the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, which <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> approved <em>ad tempus</em>, 1846. According to them, the members of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> should, after two years' <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, promise four things, poverty, chastity, obedience, and refusal of any <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignity</a>, except by obedience to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pope Pius X</a> approved <em>ad experiendum</em> the newly-revised rules and constitutions, December, 1903, for six years, and gave the final <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> on 5 Nov., 1909. The mother-house is in the Via Pettinari 57, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, attached to the church of San Salvatore. <a href="../cathen/11429a.htm">Pallotti</a> sent his first missionary fathers to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> in 1844, to take care of Italian emigrants in the <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinian</a> Oratory. Rev. D. Marquese Joseph Fa di Bruno built the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter in Hatton Garden which is the principal church of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. He was one of the generals of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, and wrote "Catholic Belief", a clear and concise exposition of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>, especially intended for non-Catholics. Over one million copies of this book were sold, and it was translated into Italian by the author. Under his generalate, the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> extended its activities beyond <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Rocca Priora, and <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> to other countries. He received from <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> the church of S. Silvestre in Capite in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the use of the English-speaking colony there. In Masio in northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, he established an international college, a mission at Hastings, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> (St. Boniface's) for the German colony; in <a href="../cathen/09260a.htm">Limburg</a>, Ehrenbreitstein, and Vallemdar there are flourishing colleges for the missions in Kamerun, West Africa. These missions have now a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> and 12 houses, with 70 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> belonging to it. In South America there are establishments at <a href="../cathen/10539a.htm">Montevideo</a>, Mercedes, Saladas, and Suipacha; 14 missions of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> in <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> embrace a territory three times the size of the <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a>. Rev. Dr. E. Kirner started the first Italian Mission in New York City in 1883, afterwards one in <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, N.Y., <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Newark</a>, N.J., Hammondton, N.J., and Baltimore, Md. In North America the Pallottini Fathers have at present over 100,000 Italian emigrants under their spiritual care. The <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, in the year 1909, was divided into four provinces, the Italian, American, English, and German.
