<h1>The Reformation</h1>  

<p>The usual term for the religious movement which made its appearance in Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in the sixteenth century, and which, while ostensibly aiming at an internal renewal of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, really led to a great revolt against it, and an abandonment of the principal <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>. We shall review the general characteristics of this movement from the following standpoints:

<h2 id="i">Causes of the Reformation</h2>

<p>The causes of the great religious revolt of the sixteenth century must be sought as far back as the fourteenth. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, had remained pure; <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">saintly</a> lives were yet frequent in all parts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and the numerous beneficient <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> institutions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> continued their course uninterruptedly. Whatever unhappy <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> existed were largely due to civil and profane influences or to the exercise of authority by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> in civil spheres; they did not obtain everywhere with equal intensity, nor did they always occur simultaneous in the same country. Ecclesiastical and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> exhibited in many places vigour and variety; works of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charity</a> abounded; <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">religious art</a> in all its forms had a living force; domestic missionaries were many and influential; <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and edifying literature was common and appreciated. Gradually, however, and largely owing to the variously hostile spirit of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil powers</a>, fostered and heightened by several elements of the new order, there grew up in many parts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> political and social <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> which hampered the free reformatory activities of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and favoured the bold and unscrupulous, who seized a unique opportunity to let loose all the forces of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> so long held in check by the harmonious action of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>.
<h3>A</h3>

<p>Since the barbarian invasions the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had effected a complete transformation and revival of the races of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and a glorious development of religious and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> had become the powerful centre of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian nations</a>, and as such had for centuries, in union with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, displayed a most beneficent activity. With the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization fully developed, it came to pass that the activities of the governing <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> bodies were no longer confined to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> domain, but affected almost every sphere of popular life. Gradually a regrettable worldliness manifested itself in many high <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. Their chief object &#151; to guide <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to his <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal goal</a> &#151; claimed too seldom their attention, and worldly activities became in too many cases the chief interest. Political power, <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">material possessions</a>, privileged position in public life, the defence of ancient historical <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, earthly interests of various kinds were only too often the chief aim of many of the higher <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Pastoral solicitude, the specifically religious and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> aim, fell largely into the background, notwithstanding various spirited and successful attempts to rectify the existing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.
<h3>B</h3>

<p>Closely connected with the above were various abuses in the lives of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">people</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Papal Curia</a> political interests and a worldly life were often prominent. Many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> (especially in countries where they were also territorial princes) bore themselves as secular rulers rather than as servants of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Many members of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/03582b.htm">chapters</a> and other <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">beneficed</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> were chiefly concerned with their income and how to increase it, especially by uniting several <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a> (even <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a>) in the hands of one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, who thus enjoyed a larger income and greater power. Luxury prevailed widely among the higher <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, while the lower <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were often oppressed. The <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> and <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetic</a> training of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> left much to be desired, the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> standard of many being very low, and the practice of <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> not everywhere observed. Not less serious was the condition of many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of men, and even of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> (which were often homes for the unmarried daughters of the nobility). The former prestige of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> had thus suffered greatly, and its members were in many places regarded with scorn. As to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">Christian people</a> itself, in numerous districts <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, <a href="../cathen/07759a.htm">religious indifference</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">immorality</a> were rife. Nevertheless, vigorous efforts to revive life were made in most lands, and side by side with this <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> decay appear numerous examples of sincere and upright <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life. Such efforts, however, were too often confined to limited circles. From the fourteenth century the demand for "reform of head and members" (<em>reformatio in capite et in membris</em>) had been voiced with ever-increasing energy by serious and discerning men, but the same cry was taken up also by many who had no real desire for a religious renewal, wishing merely to reform others but not themselves, and seeking only their own interests. This call for reformation of head and members, discussed in many writings and in conversation with insistence on existing and often exaggerated abuses, tended necessarily to lower the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> still more in the eyes of the people, especially as the <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">councils</a> of the fifteenth century, though largely occupied with attempts at reformation, did not succeed in accomplishing it extensively or permanently.
<h3>C</h3>

<p>The authority of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> had also been seriously impaired, partly through the fault of some of its occupants and partly through that of the secular princes. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> removal to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> in the fourteenth century was a grievous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, since the universal character of the <a href="../cathen/11451b.htm">papacy</a> was thus obscured in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people. Certain phases of the quarrel with Louis the Bavarian and with the <a href="../cathen/14230a.htm">Franciscan Spirituals</a> clearly indicate a decline of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> power. The severest blow was dealt by the disastrous <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">papal schism</a> (1378-1418) which familiarized <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Christians</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> might be made, with all spiritual and material weapons, against one whom many other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> regarded as the only lawful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. After the restoration of unity, the attempted reforms of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Papal Curia</a> were not thorough. <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> and the ideals of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> were <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> cultivated in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and unfortunately the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> tendencies of this movement, so opposed to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">moral law</a>, affected too profoundly the life of many higher <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, so that worldly <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, luxury, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">immorality</a> rapidly gained ground at the centre of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life. When <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority grew weak at the fountain-head, it necessarily decayed elsewhere. There were also serious administrative abuses in the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Papal Curia</a>. The ever-increasing centralization of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration had brought it about that far too many <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> in all parts of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> were conferred at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, while in the granting of them the personal interests of the petitioner, rather than the spiritual needs of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, were too often considered. The various kinds of reservation had also become a grievous abuse. Dissatisfaction was felt widely among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> at the many taxes imposed by the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> on the incumbents of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>. From the fourteenth century these taxes called forth loud complaints. In proportion as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority lost the respect of many, resentment grew against both the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11451b.htm">Papacy</a>. The reform councils of the fifteenth century, instead of improving the situation, weakened still more the highest <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority by reason of their anti-papal tendencies and measures.

<h3>D</h3>

<p>In princes and governments there had meanwhile developed a national consciousness, purely temporal and to a great extent hostile to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> powers interfered more frequently in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters, and the direct influence exercised by <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> on the domestic administration of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> rapidly increased. In the course of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries arose the modern concept of the State. During the preceding period many matters of a secular or mixed nature had been regulated or managed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in keeping with the historical development of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. With the growing self-consciousness of the State, the secular governments sought to control all matters that fell within their competence, which course, although in large measure justifiable, was new and offensive, and thus led to frequent collisions between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. The State, moreover, owing to the close historical connection between the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and secular orders, encroached on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> domain. During the course of the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Western Schism</a> (1378-1418) opposing <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> sought the support of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil powers</a>, and thus gave the latter abundant occasion to interfere in purely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs. Again, to strengthen their authority in the face of anti-papal tendencies, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of the fifteenth century made at various times certain concessions to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>, so that the latter came to regard <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs as within their domain. For the future the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was to be, not superordinate, but subordinate to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>, and was increasingly menaced with complete subjection. According as national self-consciousness developed in the various countries of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, the sense of the unity and interdependence of the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian family of nations</a> grew weaker. <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">Jealousy</a> between nations increased, selfishness gained ground, the rift between politics and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a> and religion grew wider, and discontent and perilous revolutionary tendencies spread rapidly among the people. <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">Love of wealth</a> was meanwhile given a great incentive by the discovery of the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>, the rapid development of commerce, and the new prosperity of the cities. In public life a many-sided and intense activity revealed itself, foreshadowing a new era and inclining the popular mind to changes in the hitherto undivided province of religion.
<h3>E</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> and <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> partly introduced and greatly fostered these <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>. <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">Love of luxury</a> was soon associated with the revival of the art and literature of Graeco-Roman <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> ideal was to a great extent lost sight of; higher <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> culture, previously confined in great measure to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, but now common among the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, assumed a secular character, and in only too many cases fostered actively and practically a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> spirit, <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a> and views. A crude <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">materialism</a> obtained among the higher classes of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> world, characterized by a gross love of pleasure, a desire for gain, and a voluptuousness of life diametrically opposed to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a>. Only a faint <a href="../cathen/08075a.htm">interest</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> life survived. The new art of printing made it possible to disseminate widely the works of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> authors and of their <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> imitators. Immoral poems and romances, biting satires on <a href="../cathen/11727a.htm">ecclesiastical persons</a> and institutions, revolutionary works and songs, were circulated in all directions and wrought immense harm. As <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> grew, it waged <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> of the time. The traditional <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> method had greatly degenerated owing to the finical, hair-splitting manner of treating <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> questions, and a solid and thorough treatment of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> had unhappily disappeared from many <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and writings. The <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanists</a> cultivated new methods, and based <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> on the <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">Bible</a> and the study of the Fathers, an essentially good movement which might have renewed the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, if properly developed. But the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanists</a>, their exaggerated attacks on <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>, and the frequent obscurity of their teaching aroused strong opposition from the representative <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>. The new movement, however, had won the sympathy of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay</a> world and of the section of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> devoted to <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a>. The danger was only too imminent that the reform would not be confined to <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> methods but would reach the content of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, and would find widespread support in <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> circles.

<p>The soil was thus ready for the growth of revolutionary movements in the religious sphere. Many grave warnings were indeed uttered, indicating the approaching danger and urging a fundamental reform of the actual <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>. Much had been effected in this direction by the reform movement in various <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and by the apostolic efforts of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. But a general renewal of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life and a uniform improvement of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>, beginning with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself, the centre of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, were not promptly undertaken, and soon it needed only an external impulse to precipitate a revolution, which was to cut off from the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> great territories of Central and almost all Northern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>.

<h2 id="ii">Original ideas and purposes of the reformers</h2>

<p>The first impulse to secession was supplied by the opposition of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and of <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> in German <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> of an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> for contributions towards the building of the new <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. For a long time it had been customary for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> to grant <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> for buildings of public utility (e.g. bridges). In such cases the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> as a remission of the punishment due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (not of guilt of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>) had been always upheld, and the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> (especially the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> confession to obtain <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>) always inculcated. But the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a> for a good object, prescribed only as a good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">work</a> supplementary to the chief <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> for the gaining of the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, was often prominently emphasized. The <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> <a href="../cathen/04164b.htm">commissaries</a> sought to <a href="../cathen/04103a.htm">collect</a> as much money as possible in connexion with the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>. Indeed, frequently since the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Western Schism</a> the spiritual needs of the people did not receive as much consideration as a motive for <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgating</a> an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, as the need of the good object by promoting which the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> was to be gained, and the consequent need of obtaining <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> for this purpose. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and other crises, the erection of churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and numerous other causes led to the granting of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> in the fifteenth century. The consequent abuses were heightened by the fact that secular rulers frequently forbade the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> within their territories, <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consenting</a> only on condition that a portion of the receipts should be given to them. In practice, therefore, and in the public mind the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> took on an <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> aspect, and, as they were frequent, many came to regard them as an oppressive tax. Vainly did earnest men raise their voices against this abuse, which aroused no little bitterness against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order and particularly the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Papal Curia</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> for the new <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a> furnished <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> with an opportunity to attack <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> in general, and this attack was the immediate occasion of the Reformation in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. A little later the same motive led <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> to put forth his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> teachings, thereby inaugurating the Reformation in German <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. Both declared that they were attacking only the abuses of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>; however, they soon taught <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in many ways contrary to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>The great applause which <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> received on his first appearance, both in <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> circles and among some <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and some of the earnest-minded <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, was due to the dissatisfaction with the existing abuses. His own <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> views and the influence of a portion of his followers very soon drove <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> into rebellion against <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority as such, and eventually led him into open <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. His chief original supporters were among the <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanists</a>, the immoral <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the lower grades of the landed nobility imbued with revolutionary tendencies. It was soon evident that he meant to subvert all the fundamental institutions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Beginning by proclaiming the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a> of "<a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone", he later rejected all <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> remedies (especially the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and the Mass), denied the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritoriousness</a> of good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> (thus condemning <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">asceticism</a> in general), and finally rejected the institution of a genuine <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> (especially the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>) in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. His <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">Bible</a> as the sole <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>, with rejection of all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, established subjectivism in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. By this revolutionary assault <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> forfeited the support of many serious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> indisposed to break with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> but on the other hand won over all the anti-ecclesiastical elements, including numerous <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> who left the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> to break their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who espoused his cause with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of marrying. The support of his sovereign, Frederick of Saxony, was of great importance. Very soon secular princes and municipal magistrates made the Reformation a pretext for arbitrary interference in purely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and religious affairs, for appropriating <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> and disposing of it at pleasure, and for deciding what <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> their subjects should accept. Some followers of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> went to even greater extremes. The <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">"Iconoclasts"</a> revealed the extremest possibilities of the principles advocated by <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, while in the <a href="../cathen/11597a.htm">Peasants' War</a> the most oppressed elements of German <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> put into practice the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the reformer. Ecclesiastical affairs were now reorganized on the basis of the new teachings; henceforth the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> is ever more clearly the supreme judge in purely religious matters, and completely disregards any independent <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority.

<p>A second centre of the Reformation was established by <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> at <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a>. Though he differed in many particulars from <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, and was much more radical than the latter in his transformation of the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonial</a> of the Mass, the aims of his followers were identical with those of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>. Political considerations played a great role in the development of <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwinglianism</a>, and the magistracy of <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a>, after a <a href="../cathen/09557a.htm">majority</a> of its members had declared for <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>, became a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> promoter of the Reformation. Arbitrary <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> were issued by the magistrates concerning <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization; the councillors who remained true to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> were expelled from the council, and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">services</a> were forbidden in the city. The city and the canton of <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a> were reformed by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>. Other parts of German <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> experienced a similar <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> developed later its own peculiar Reformation; this was organized at <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> by <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>. <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> is distinguished from <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> and <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwinglianism</a> by a more rigid and consistent form of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and by the strictness of its <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>, which regulate the whole domestic and public life of the citizen. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization of <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> was declared a fundamental <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the Republic of Geneva, and the authorities gave their entire support to the reformer in the establishment of his new court of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin's</a> word was the highest authority, and he tolerated no contradiction of his views or regulations. <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> was introduced into <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> and the surrounding country by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were banished, and the people oppressed and compelled to attend <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a>.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the origin of the Reformation was entirely different. Here the sensual and tyrannical <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, with the support of Thomas Cranmer, whom the king made the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, severed his country from <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">ecclesiastical unity</a> because the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> guardian of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, refused to recognize the invalid marriage of the king with Anne Boleyn during the lifetime of his lawful wife. Renouncing obedience to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the despotic monarch constituted himself supreme judge even in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs; the opposition of such good men as <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">Thomas More</a> and <a href="../cathen/08462b.htm">John Fisher</a> was overcome in blood. The king wished, however, to retain unchanged both the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> a series of doctrines and institutions rejected by <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and his followers to be strictly proscribed by Act of Parliament (Six Articles) under the pain of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> also the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> constituted itself supreme judge in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and laid the foundation for further arbitrary religious innovations. Under the following sovereign, Edward VI (1547-53), the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> party gained the upper hand, and thenceforth began to promote the Reformation in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> according to the principles of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>. Here also force was employed to spread the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">new doctrines</a>. This last effort of the Reformation movement was practically confined to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">ANGLICANISM</a>).

<h2 id="iii">Method of spreading the Reformation</h2>

<p>In the choice of means for extending the Reformation its founders and supporters were not fastidious, availing themselves of any factor which could further their movement.
<h3>A</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/04733b.htm">Denunciation</a> of real and supposed abuses in religious and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life was, especially at the beginning, one of the chief methods employed by the reformers to promote their designs. By this means they won over many who were dissatisfied with existing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>, and were ready to support any movement that promised a change. But it was especially the widespread <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and of the members of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, fostered by the incessantly repeated and only too often justifiable complaints about abuses, that most efficiently favoured the reformers, who very soon <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> attacked the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority, recognizing in it the supreme guardian of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Hence the multitude of lampoons, often most vulgar, against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and in general against all representatives of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. These pamphlets were circulated everywhere among the people, and thereby respect for authority was still more <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> shaken. Painters prepared shameless and degrading caricatures of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, to illustrate the text of hostile pamphlets. Waged with every possible weapon (even the most reprehensible), this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> against the representatives of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as the supposed originators of all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> abuses, prepared the way for the reception of the Reformation. A distinction was no longer drawn between temporary and corrigible abuses and fundamental <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>; together with the abuses, important <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions, resting on Divine foundation were simultaneously abolished.
<h3>B</h3>

<p>Advantage was also taken of the divisions existing in many places between the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>. The development of the State, in its modern form, among the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Christian peoples of the West</a> gave rise to many disputes between the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, between <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the cities, between <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and the territorial lords. When the reformers withdrew from the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> all authority, especially all influence in civil affairs, they enabled the princes and municipal authorities to end these long-pending strifes to their own advantage by arbitrarily arrogating to themselves all disputed <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, banishing the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> whose <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> they usurped, and then establishing by their own authority a completely new <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization. The Reformed <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> thus possessed from the beginning only such <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> as the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> were pleased to assign them. Consequently the Reformed national Churches were completely subject to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>, and the Reformers, who had entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> the actual execution of their principles, had now no means of ridding themselves of this servitude.
<h3>C</h3>

<p>In the course of centuries an immense number of foundations had been made for religious, <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> objects, and had been provided with rich material resources. Churches, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> had often great incomes and extensive possessions, which aroused the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of secular rulers. The Reformation enabled the latter to secularize this vast <a href="../cathen/12472a.htm">ecclesiastical wealth</a>, since the leaders of the Reformation constantly inveighed against the centralization of such <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The princes and municipal authorities were thus invited to seize <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>, and employ it for their own purposes. Ecclesiastical principalities, which were entrusted to the incumbents only as <a href="../cathen/11727a.htm">ecclesiastical persons</a> for administration and usufruct, were, in defiance of actual <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, by exclusion of the incumbents, transformed into secular principalities. In this way the Reformers succeeded in depriving the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">temporal wealth</a> provided for its many needs, and in diverting the same to their own advantage.
<h3>D</h3>

<p>Human emotions, to which the Reformers appealed in the most various ways, were another means of spreading the Reformation. The very <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> which these innovators defended &#151; <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> freedom, license of thought, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> and capacity of each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> to found his own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, and other similar principles &#151; were very seductive for many. The abolition of religious institutions which acted as a curb on <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (<a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confession</a>, <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, <a href="../cathen/01067a.htm">abstinence</a>, <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>) attracted the lascivious and frivolous. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> against the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, against <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> and <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a>, against the practices of a higher <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life, won for the Reformation a great number of those who, without a serious <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">vocation</a>, had embraced the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> from purely <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and worldly motives, and who wished to be rid of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which had grown burdensome, and to be free to gratify their <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">sensual cravings</a>. This they could do the more easily, as the confiscation of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the Churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> rendered it possible to provide for the material advancement of ex-monks and ex-nuns, and of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasized</a>. In the innumerable writings and pamphlets intended for the people the Reformers made it their frequent endeavour to excite the basest <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instincts</a>. Against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> who had remained true to their <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> convictions, the most incredible lampoons and <a href="../cathen/09210a.htm">libels</a> were disseminated. In language of the utmost coarseness <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrines</a> and institutions were distorted and ridiculed. Among the lower, mostly uneducated, and abandoned elements of the population, the baser <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instincts</a> were stimulated and pressed into the service of the Reformation.

<p>At first many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> displayed great apathy towards the Reformers, attaching to the new movement no importance; its chiefs were thus given a longer <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> to spread their doctrines. Even later, many worldly-inclined <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, though remaining <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, were very lax in combating <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and in employing the proper means to prevent its further advance. The same might be said of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, who were to a great extent <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and <a href="../cathen/07759a.htm">indifferent</a>, and looked on idly at the defection of the people. The Reformers, on the other hand, displayed the greatest <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for their cause. Leaving no means unused by word and pen, by constant intercourse with similarly minded <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, by popular eloquence, which the leaders of the Reformation were especially skilled in employing, by <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> and popular writings appealing to the weaknesses of the popular character, by inciting the fanaticism of the masses, in short by clever and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> utilization of every opportunity and opening that presented itself, they <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> their ardour for the spread of their doctrines. Meanwhile they proceeded with great astuteness, purported to adhere strictly to the essential <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, retained at first many of the external <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship, and declared their <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of abolishing only things resting on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> invention, seeking thus to deceive the people concerning the real objects of their activity. They found indeed many <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> opponents in the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> and <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, but the great need, especially at the beginning, was a universally organized and systematically conducted resistance to this <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> reformation.
<h3>F</h3>

<p>Many new institutions introduced by the Reformers flattered the multitude &#151; e.g. the reception of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> by the whole people, the use of the vernacular at Divine service, the popular religious <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> used during services, the reading of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, the denial of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> difference between <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. In this category may be included doctrines which had an attraction for many &#151; e.g. <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone without reference to good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, the denial of freedom of will, which furnished an excuse for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">moral lapses</a>, personal <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (i.e. subjective confidence in the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>), the universal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, which seemed to give all a direct share in <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> functions and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration.
<h3>G</h3>

<p>Finally, one of the chief means employed in promoting the spread of the Reformation was the use of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> by the princes and the municipal authorities. <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Priests</a> who remained <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> were expelled and replaced by adherents of the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, and the people were compelled to attend the new services. The <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> adherents of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were variously <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> saw to it that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the descendants of those who had strongly opposed the Reformation was gradually sapped. In many places the people were severed from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by brutal <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>; elsewhere to deceive the people the ruse was employed of retaining the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> outwardly for a long time, and prescribing for the reformed <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> the ecclesiastical <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">ecclesiastical vestments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship. The history of the Reformation shows incontestably that the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> was the chief factor in spreading it in all lands, and that in the last analysis it was not religious, but dynastic, political, and social interests which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> decisive. Add to this that the princes and municipal magistrates who had joined the Reformers tyrannized grossly over the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">consciences</a> of their subjects and burghers. All must accept the religion prescribed by the civil ruler. The principle "Cuius regio, illius et religio" (Religion goes with the land) is an outgrowth of the Reformation, and was by it and its adherents, wherever they possessed the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> power, put into practice.

<h2 id="iv">Spread of the Reformation in the various countries</h2>
<h3 id="A">Germany and German Switzerland</h3>

<p>The Reformation was inaugurated in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> when <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> affixed his celebrated theses to the doors of the church at <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>, 31 October, 1517. From the consequences of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">papal excommunication</a> and the imperial ban <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> was protected by Elector Frederick of Saxony, his territorial sovereign. While outwardly adopting a neutral attitude, the latter encouraged the formation of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> communities within his domains, after <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> had returned to <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> and resumed there the leadership of the reform movement, in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a>. It was <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> who introduced the arbitrary regulations for <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">Divine worship</a> and religious functions; in accordance with these, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> communities were established, whereby an organized <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> body was opposed to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Among the other German princes who early associated themselves with <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and seconded his efforts were: <ul><li>John of Saxony (the brother of Frederick); <li>Grand-Master Albert of Prussia, who converted the lands of his order into a secular duchy, becoming its hereditary lord on accepting <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>; <li>Dukes Henry and Albert of Mecklenburg; <li>Count Albert of Mansfield; <li>Count Edzard of East Friesland; <li>Landgrave Philip of Hesse, who declared definitively for the Reformation after 1524.</ul>

<p>Meanwhile in several German imperial cities the reform movement was initiated by followers of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> &#151; especially in Ulm, <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, Nuremburg, N&ouml;rdlingen, <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, Erfurt, Zwickau, <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort-on-the-Main</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> princes formed the Alliance of Torgau on 4 May, 1526, for their common defence. By their appearance at the Diet of Speyer in 1526 they secured the adoption of the resolution that, with respect to the Edict of Worms against <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, each might adopt such attitude as he could answer for before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and emperor. Liberty to introduce the Reformation into their territories was thus granted to the territorial rulers. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> estates became discouraged, while the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> princes grew ever more extravagant in their demands. Even the entirely moderate <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> of the Diet of Speyer (1529) drew a protest from the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> and Reformed estates.

<p>The negotiations at the Diet of Augsburg (1530), at which the estates rejecting the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> elaborated their <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">creed</a> (Augsburg Confession), showed that the restoration of <a href="../cathen/15132a.htm">religious unity</a> was not to be effected. The Reformation extended wider and wider, both <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> and <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwinglianism</a> being introduced into other German territories. Besides the above-mentioned principalities and cities, it had made its way by 1530 into the principalities of Bayreuth, Ansbach, <a href="../cathen/01513e.htm">Anhalt</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03019a.htm">Brunswick-Lunenburg</a>, and in the next few years into <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>, J&uuml;lich-Cleve, and Wurtemberg. In <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a> and the duchy of Liegnitz the Reformation also made great strides. In 1531 the <a href="../cathen/14058b.htm">Smalkaldic League</a>, an offensive and defensive alliance, was concluded between the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes and cities. Especially after its renewal (1535) this league was joined by other cities and princes who had espoused the Reformation, e.g. Count Palatine Rupert of Zweibr&uuml;cken, Count William of Nassau, the cities of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, Kempten, <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, and others. Further negotiations and discussions between the religious parties were instituted with a view to ending the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, but without success. Among the methods adopted by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> in spreading the Reformation force was ever more freely employed. The Diocese of Naumburg-Zeitz becoming <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a>, Elector John Frederick of Saxony installed by force in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> preacher Nicholas Amsdorf (instead of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>, <a href="../cathen/11787a.htm">Julius von Pflug</a>, chosen by the chapter) and himself undertook the secular government. Duke Henry of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel was exiled in 1542, and the Reformation introduced into his domains by force. In Cologne itself the Reformation was very nearly established by force. Some <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> princes <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> delinquent, taking no measures against the innovations that spread daily in widening circles. Into Pfalz-Neuburg and the towns of Halberstadt, Halle, etc., the Reformation found entrance. The collapse of the <a href="../cathen/14058b.htm">Smalkaldic League</a> (1547) somewhat stemmed the progress of the Reformation: <a href="../cathen/11787a.htm">Julius von Pflug</a> was installed in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Naumburg, Duke Henry of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel recovered his lands, and Hermann von Wied had to resign the <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Diocese of Cologne</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> was thus maintained.

<p>The formula of union established by the Diet of Augsburg in 1547-48 (Augsburg Interim) did not succeed in its object, although introduced into many <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> territories. Meanwhile the treachery of Prince Moritz of Saxony, who made a secret treaty with Henry II of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany's</a> enemy, and formed a confederation with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes William of Hesse, John Albert of Mecklenburg, and <a href="../cathen/01262a.htm">Albert of Brandenburg</a>, to make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on the emperor and empire, broke the power of the emperor. At the suggestion of Charles, King Ferdinand convened the Diet of Augsburg in 1555, at which, after long negotiations, the compact known as the Religious Peace of Augsburg was concluded. This pact contained the following provisions in its twenty-two paragraphs:

<ul><li>between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> imperial estates and those of the Augsburg Confession (the <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwinglians</a> were not considered in the treaty) peace and harmony was to be observed; <li>no estate of the empire was to compel another estate or its subjects to change religion, nor was it to make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on such on account of religion; <li>should an <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignitary</a> espouse the Augsburg Confession, he was to lose his <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignity</a> with all offices and emoluments connected with it, without prejudice, however, to his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and private possession. Against this <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> proviso the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> estates protested: <li>the holders of the Augsburg Confession were to be left in possession of all <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> which they had held since the beginning of the Reformation; after 1555 neither party might seize anything from the other; <li>until the conclusion of peace between the contending religious bodies (to be effected at the approaching Diet of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>) the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was suspended in the territories of the Augsburg Confession; <li>should any conflict arise between the parties concerning land or <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, an attempt must first be made to settle such disputes by <a href="../cathen/01682b.htm">arbitration</a>; <li>no imperial estate might protect the subjects of another estate from the authorities; <li>every citizen of the Empire had the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of choosing either of the two recognized <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> and of practising it in another territory without loss of <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> (without prejudice, however, to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the territorial lord over his peasantry); <li>this peace was to include the free <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> and the free cities of the empire, and the imperial courts had to be guided exactly by its provisions; <li><a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a> might be administered either in the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or of His Holy Gospel. </ul>

<p>By this peace the religious <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> was definitively established; henceforth the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> estates are opposing camps. Almost all <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> frontier in the west to the Polish frontier in the east, the territory of the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a> in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, Central <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> with the exception of the greater part of the western portion, and (in South <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>) Wurtemburg, Ansbach, Pfalz-Zweibrucken, and other small domains, with numerous free cities, had espoused the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>. Moreover, in the south and southeast, which remained prevailingly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, it found more or less numerous supporters. <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> also spread fairly widely.

<p>But the Peace of Augsburg failed to secure the harmony hoped for. In defiance of its express provisions, A series of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> principalities (2 archbishoprics, 12 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, and numerous <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>) were reformed and <a href="../cathen/10453a.htm">secularized</a> before the beginning of the seventeenth century. The Catholic League was formed for the protection of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests, and to offset the Protestant Union. The <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a> soon followed, a struggle most ominous for <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, since it surrendered the country to its enemies from the west and north, and destroyed the power, <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and influence of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. The Peace of Westphalia, concluded in 1648 with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> at Munster and with <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a> at <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, confirmed definitely the status of religious <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, placed both the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> and the Reformed on the same footing as the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, and granted the estates <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the emperor the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of introducing the Reformation. Henceforth territorial sovereigns could compel their subjects to adopt a given religion, subject to the recognition of the independence of those who in 1624 enjoyed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to hold their own religious services. State Absolutism in religious matters had now attained its highest development in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>.

<p>In German <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> a similar course was pursued. After <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a> had accepted and forcibly introduced the Reformation, Basle followed its example. In Basle <a href="../cathen/11213a.htm">John &OElig;colampadius</a> and Wolfgang Capito associated themselves with <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>, spread his teaching, and won a victory for the new <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> members of the Great Council were expelled. Similar results followed in Appenzell Outer Rhodes, Schaffhausen, and Glarus. After long hesitation, the Reformation was accepted also at <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a>, where an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a>, Franz Kolb, with Johann and Berthold Haller, preached <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwinglianism</a>; <a href="../cathen/10453a.htm">all the monasteries were suppressed</a>, and great <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> was exercised to force <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwinglianism</a> upon the people of the territory. <a href="../cathen/06347a.htm">St. Gall</a>, where Joachim Vadianus preached, and a great portion of Graubunden also adopted the innovations. Throughout the empire <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwinglianism</a> was a strong rival of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> conflict between the two confessions began, despite constant negotiations for union. Attempts were not wanting in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> to terminate the unhappy religious division. In May, 1526, a great religious disputation was held at <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> being represented by <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Eck</a>, <a href="../cathen/05741b.htm">Johann Faber</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10645a.htm">Murner</a>, and the Reformed by <a href="../cathen/11213a.htm">&OElig;colampadius</a> and Berthold Haller. The result was favourable to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; most of the representatives of the estates present declared against the Reformation, and writings of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> were prohibited. This aroused the opposition of the Reformed estates. In 1527 <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a> formed an alliance with <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>; Basle, Bern, and other Reformed estates joined the Confederacy in 1528. In self-defence the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> estates formed an alliance in 1529 for the protection of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> within their territories. In the resulting <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> estates gained a victory at Kappel, and <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> was slain on the battlefield. <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a> and <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a> were granted peace on condition that no place should disturb another on account of religion, and that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> services might be freely held in the common territories. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> was restored in certain districts of Glarus and Appenzell; the <a href="../cathen/06347a.htm">Abbey of St. Gall</a> was restored to the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, though the town remained Reformed. In <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a>, Basle, <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a>, and Schaffhausen, however, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were unable to secure their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Reformers soon composed formal statements of their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>; especially noteworthy were the First Helvetic Confession (Confessio Helvetica I), composed by Bullinger, Myconius, Grynaeus, and others (1536), and the Second Confession composed by Bullinger in 1564 (Confessio Helvetica II); the latter was adopted in most Reformed territories of the <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwinglian</a> type.
<h3 id="B">The northern kingdoms: Denmark, Norway and Sweden</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> Reformation found an early entrance into <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> (then united to <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>), and <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>. Its introduction was primarily due to royal influence. King Christian II of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> (1513-23) welcomed the Reformation as a means of weakening the nobility and especially the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (who possessed extensive <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>) and thereby extending the power of the throne. His first attempt to spread the teaching of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Master Martin Luther</a> in 1520 met with little success: the barons and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> soon deposed him for tyranny, and in his place elected his uncle Duke Frederick of Schleswig and Holstein. The latter, who was a secret follower of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>, deceived the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and nobility, and <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> at his <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> in 1523 to maintain the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Religion. Seated on the throne, however, he favoured the Reformers, especially the preacher Hans Tausen. At the Diet of Odensee in 1527 he granted freedom of religion to the Reformers, permitted the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marry</a>, and reserved to the king the confirmation of 11 episcopal appointments. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> was spread by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> means, and the faithful adherents of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion were oppressed. His son, Christian III who had already "reformed" Holstein, threw into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who protested against his succession, and courted the support of the barons. With the exception of Bishop Ronow of Roskilde, who died in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> (1544), all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> agreed to resign and to refrain from opposing the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, whereupon they were set at liberty and their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was restored to them. All the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who opposed the Reformation were expelled, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> suppressed, and the Reformation introduced everywhere by force. In 1537 <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> companion Johann Bugenhagen (Pomeranus) was summoned from <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> to <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> to establish the Reformation in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. At the Diet of Copenhagen in 1546 the last <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were withdrawn; <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of inheritance and eligibility for any office were denied them, and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were forbidden to reside in the country under <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">penalty of death</a>.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> Archbishop Olaus of <a href="../cathen/15064a.htm">Trondhjem</a> <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a> to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>, but was compelled to leave the country, as a supporter of the deposed king, Christian II. With the aid of the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> nobility Christian III introduced the Reformation into <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> by force. <a href="../cathen/07615b.htm">Iceland</a> resisted longer royal absolutism and the religious innovations. The unflinching <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Holum, Jon Arason, was beheaded, and the Reformation spread rapidly after 1551. Some externals of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> period were retained &#151; the title of <em><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a></em> and to some extent the <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">liturgical vestments</a> and forms of worship.

<p>Into <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a> also the Reformation was introduced for political reasons by the secular ruler. Gustavus Vasa, who had been given to Christian II of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> in 1520 as a hostage and had escaped to Lubeck, there became acquainted with the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> teaching and recognized the services it could render him. Returning to <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, he became the first imperial chancellor, and, after being elected king on the deposition of Christian II in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, attempted to convert <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a> into a hereditary monarchy, but had to yield to the opposition of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and nobility. The Reformation helped him to attain his desire, although its introduction was difficult on account of the great fidelity of the people to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. He appointed to high positions two <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedes</a>, the brothers Olaf and Lorenz Peterson, who had studied at <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> and had accepted <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> teaching; one was appointed court <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> at <a href="../cathen/14297a.htm">Stockholm</a> and the other professor at Upsala. Both laboured in secret for the spread of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>, and won many adherents, including the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> Lorenz Anderson, whom the king thereupon named his chancellor. In his dealings with <a href="../cathen/01159b.htm">Pope Adrian VI</a> and his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> the king simulated the greatest fidelity to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, while he was giving ever-increased support to religious innovations. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, who offered a strong opposition to his designs, were banished from the kingdom, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who resisted were subjected to all kinds of oppression. After a religious disputation at the <a href="../cathen/15208a.htm">University of Upsala</a> the king assigned the victory to Olaf Peterson and proceeded to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranize</a> the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, to confiscate <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>, and to employ every means to compel the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to accept the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. A popular rebellion gave him an opportunity of accusing the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of high treason, and in 1527 the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15207a.htm">Upsala</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Westraes were executed. Many <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> acceded to the wishes of the king; others resisted and had to endure <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, an heroic resistance being offered by the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of Wadstena. After the Diet of Westraes in 1527 great concessions were made to the king through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of fresh subjection to the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danes</a>, especially the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of confiscating <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> appointments and removals, etc. Some of the nobles were soon won over to the king's side, when it was made optional to take back all the goods donated to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by one's ancestors sine 1453. <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">Clerical celibacy</a> was abolished, and the vernacular introduced into Divine service. The king constituted himself supreme authority in religious matters, and severed the country from <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">Catholic unity</a>. The Synod of Orebro (1529) completed the Reformation, although most of the external <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07664a.htm">images</a> in the churches, the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a>, and the titles of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm"><em>archbishop</em></a> and <em><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a></em> were retained. Later (1544) Gustavus Vasa made the title to the throne hereditary in his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. The numerous risings directed against him and his innovations were put down with bloody <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. At a later period arose other great religious contests, likewise of a political character.

<p><a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> also spread to some extent, and Eric XIV (1560-68) endeavoured to promote it. He was, however, dethroned by the nobility for his tyranny, and his brother John III (1568-92) named king. The latter restored the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and tried to restore the land to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But on the death of his first wife, the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Princess Katherina, his ardour declined in the face of numerous difficulties, and his second wife favoured <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>. On John's death his son Sigismund, already King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> and thoroughly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in sentiment, became King of <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>. However, his uncle Duke Charles, the chancellor of the kingdom, gave energetic support to the Reformation, and the Augsburg Confession was introduced at the <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">National Synod</a> of Upsala in 1593. Against the chancellor and the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> nobility Sigismund found himself powerless; finally (1600) he was deposed as an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> from the "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>", and Charles was appointed king. Gustavus Adolphus (1611-32), Charles' son, used the Reformation to increase the power of <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a> by his campaigns. The Reformation was then successfully enforced throughout <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>.
<h3 id="C">France and French Switzerland</h3>

<p>In certain <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> circles in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> there originated at an early date a movement favourable to the Reformation. The centre of this movement was Meaux, where Bishop Guillaume Briconnet favoured the <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> and <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystic</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, and where <a href="../cathen/09114b.htm">Professor Lef&egrave;vre d'Etaples</a>, W. Farel, and J. de Clerc, <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanists</a> with <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> tendencies, taught. However, the Court, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and the Parlement opposed the religious innovations, and the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> community of Meaux was dissolved. More important centres of the Reformation were found in the South, where the <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldensians</a> had prepared the soil. Here public riots occurred during which images of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were destroyed. The parlements in most cases took energetic measures against the innovators, although in certain quarters the latter found protectors &#151; especially Margaret of Valois, sister of <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">King Francis I</a> and wife of Henry d'Albret, King of <a href="../cathen/10721a.htm">Navarre</a>. The leaders of the Reformation in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> sought to win over <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">King Francis I</a>, for political reasons an ally of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> German princes; the king, however, remained true to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and suppressed the reform movements throughout his land. In the southeast districts, especially in Provence and Dauphine, the supporters of the new doctrines increased through the efforts of Reformers from <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> and <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, until finally the <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecration</a> and plundering of churches compelled the king to take energetic steps against them. After <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> had established itself in <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, its influence grew rapidly in French reform circles. <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> appeared at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> as defender of the new religious movement in 1533, dedicated to the French king in 1536 his "Institutiones Christianae Religionis", and went to <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> in the same year. Expelled from <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, he returned in 1541, and began there the final establishment of his religious organization. <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, with its academy inaugurated by <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, was a leading centre of the Reformation and affected principally <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Pierre le Clerc established the first <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> community at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; other communities were established at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, repressive measures proving of little avail. Bishop Jacques Spifamius of <a href="../cathen/10778a.htm">Nevers</a> lapsed into <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>, and in 1559 <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> witnessed the assembly of a general synod of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> Reformers, which adopted a <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">creed</a> and introduced the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> presbyteral constitution for the Reformed communities. Owing to the support of the <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldensians</a>, to the dissemination of reform literature from <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, Basle, and <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, and to the steady influx of preachers from these cities, the adherents of the Reformation increased in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. On the death of King Henry II (1559) the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Calvinist Huguenots</a> wished to take advantage of the weakness of the government to increase their power. The queen-dowager, <a href="../cathen/03443a.htm">Catherine de Medici</a>, was an ambitious intriguer, and pursued a time-serving policy. Political aspirations soon became entangled with the religious movement, which thereby assumed wider proportions and a greater importance. From opposition to the ruling line and to the powerful and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> dukes of <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Guise</a>, the princes of the Bourbon line became the protectors of the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>; these were Antoine* de Vend&ocirc;me, King of <a href="../cathen/10721a.htm">Navarre</a>, and his brothers, especially Louis de Cond&eacute;. They were joined by the Constable de Montmorency, Admiral Coligny and his brother d'Andelot, and Cardinal Odet de Ch&acirc;tillon, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Beauvais</a>.

<p>In spite of anti-heretical <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> was making steady progress in the South of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, when on 17 January, 1562, the <a href="../cathen/03443a.htm">queen-dowager</a>, regent for the young Charles IX, issued an edict of <a href="../cathen/14761a.htm">toleration</a>, allowing the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> the free practice of their religion outside the towns and without weapons, but forbidding all interference with and acts of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutions, and ordering the <a href="../cathen/12788a.htm">restitution</a> of all churches and all <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> taken from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Rendered thereby only more audacious, the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> committed, especially in the South, revolting acts of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, putting to death <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> even in the suburbs of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The occurrence at Vassy in Champagne on 1 March, 1562, where the retinue of the <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm#iii">Duke of Guise</a> came into conflict with the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>, inaugurated the first religious and civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Although this ended with the defeat of the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>, it occasioned great losses to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">Relics of saints</a> were burned and scattered, magnificent churches reduced to ashes, and numerous <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a>. The Edict of Amboise granted new favours to the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> nobles, although the earlier edict of <a href="../cathen/14761a.htm">tolerance</a> was withdrawn. Five other civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> followed, during which occurred the <a href="../cathen/13333b.htm">massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day</a> (24 August, 1572). It was not until the line of Valois had become extinct with Henry III (1589), and <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a> (who embraced <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in 1593) of the Bourbon line had ascended the throne, that the religious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> were brought to an end by the Edict of Nantes (13 April, 1598); this granted the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> not only full religious freedom and admission to all public offices, but even a privileged position in the State. Ever-increasing difficulties of a political nature arose, and <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Cardinal Richelieu</a> aimed at ending the influential position of the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>. The capture of their chief fortress, <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a> (28 October, 1628), finally broke the power of the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">French Calvinists</a> as a political entity. Later, many of their number returned to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, although there still remained numerous adherents of <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.
<h3 id="D">Italy and Spain</h3>

<p>While in both these lands there appeared isolated supporters of the Reformation, no strong or extensive organization arose. Here and there in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> influential <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> (e.g. <a href="../cathen/04128b.htm">Vittoria Colonna</a> and her circle) favoured the reform movement, but they desired such to occur within, not as a rebellion against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. A few <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> embraced <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> or <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>, e.g. John Valdez, secretary of the Viceroy of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. In the cities of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> (where Duchess Renata favoured the Reformation), and Florence might be found adherents of the German and <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Reformers, although not so extreme as their prototypes. The more prominent had to leave the country &#151; thus <a href="../cathen/15353b.htm">Pietro Paolo Vergerio</a>, who fled to <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> and thence to <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>; Bernardino Ochino, who fled to <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> and was later professor at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>; Petrus Martyr Vermigli, who fled to <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a>, and was subsequently active at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, and again at <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a>. By the vigorous inauguration of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform in the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, through the activity of numerous <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">saintly</a> men (such as <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> and Philip Neri), through the vigilance of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the diligence of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, the Reformation was excluded from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In some circles <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> and anti-trinitarian tendencies showed themselves, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was the birthplace of the two heresiarchs, Laelius Socinus and his nephew Faustus Socinus, the founders of <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinianism</a>.

<p>The course of events was the same in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> as in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Despite some attempts to disseminate anti-ecclesiastical writings in the country, the Reformation won no success, thanks to the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> displayed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and public authorities in counter-acting its efforts. The few <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> who accepted the new doctrines were unable to develop any reforming activity at home, and lived abroad&mdash;e.g. Francisco Enzinas (Dryander), who made a translation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> for <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, Juan Diaz, Gonsalvo Montano, Miguel Servede (Servetus), who was condemned by <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> at <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> for his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> and burnt at the stake.
<h3 id="E">Hungary and Transylvania</h3>

<p>The Reformation was spread in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> by <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungarians</a> who had studied at <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> and had there embraced <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>. In 1525 stringent <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were passed against the adherents of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> doctrines, but their numbers continued to increase, especially among the nobility, who wished to confiscate the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>, and in the free cities of the kingdom. <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> victories and conquest and the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between Ferdinand of Austria and John Zapolya favoured the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">reformers</a>. In addition to the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> there were soon followers of <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> in the country. Five <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> towns in Upper <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> accepted the Augsburg Confession. <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>, however, gradually won the upper hand, although the domestic disputes between the reforming <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> by no means ceased. In <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a> merchants from Hermannstadt, who had become acquainted with <a href="../cathen/09458a.htm">Luther's heresy</a> at <a href="../cathen/09138b.htm">Leipzig</a>, spread the Reformation after 1521. Notwithstanding the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the Reformers, a <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was started at Hermannstadt, and the nobility endeavoured to use the Reformation as a means of confiscating the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In 1529 the regular orders and the most vigorous champions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were driven from the town. At Kronstadt the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> preacher Johann Honter gained the ascendency in 1534, the Mass being abolished and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Divine service</a> organized after the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> model. At a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held in 1544 the <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxon</a> nation in <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a> decided in favour of the Augsburg Confession, while the rural Magyars accepted <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>. At the Diet of Klausenburg in 1556 general religious freedom was granted and the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> confiscated for the defence of the country and the erection of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Among the supporters of the Reformation far-reaching divisions prevailed. Besides the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, there were <a href="../cathen/15154b.htm">Unitarians</a> (<a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinians</a>) and <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a>, and each of these <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> waged <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the others. A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> minority survived among the Greek Walachians.
<h3 id="F">Poland, Livonia, and Courland</h3>

<p>Poles learned of the Reformation through some young students from <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> and through the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> and <a href="../cathen/02616a.htm">Moravian Brethren</a>. <a href="../cathen/09011a.htm">Archbishop Laski</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> and King Sigismund I (1501-48) energetically opposed the spread of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">heretical doctrines</a>. However, the supporters of the Reformation succeeded in winning recruits at the <a href="../cathen/04465a.htm">University of Cracow</a>, at Posen, and at Dantzig. From Dantzig the Reformation spread to Thorn and Elbing, and certain nobles favoured the new doctrines. Under the rule of the weak Sigismund II (1548-72) there were in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, besides the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02616a.htm">Bohemian Brethren</a>, <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwinglians</a>, <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinians</a>. Prince Radziwill and <a href="../cathen/09011a.htm">John Laski</a> favoured <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>, and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> was translated into Polish in accordance with the views of this party in 1563. Despite the efforts of the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a>, <a href="../cathen/09279a.htm">Aloisius Lippomano</a> (1556-58) free practice of religion was secretly granted in the aforementioned three cities, and the nobility were allowed to hold private religious services in their houses. The different Reformed <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> fought among one another, the formula of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> introduced at the General Synod of Sandomir in 1570 by the Reformed, the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02616a.htm">Bohemian Brethren</a> producing no unity. In 1573 the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> parties secured the religious peace of <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, which granted equal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and "Dissidents", and established permanent peace between the two sections. By the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> inauguration of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform, the diligent activity of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> and able <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and the labours of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, further progress of the Reformation was prevented.

<p>In Livonia and Courland, the territories of the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a>, the course of the Reformation was the same as in the other territory of the Order, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. Commander Gotthard Kettler of Courland embraced the Augsburg Confession, and converted the land into a secular hereditary duchy, tributary to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. In Livonia Commander Walter of Plettenberg strove to foster <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>, which had been accepted at Riga, Dorpat, and Reval since 1523, hoping thus to make himself independent of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Riga. When Margrave William of Brandenburg became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Riga in 1539, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> rapidly obtained exclusive sway in Livonia.
<h3 id="G">Netherlands</h3>

<p>During the reign of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> the seventeen provinces of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> remained fairly immune from the infection of the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. Several followers of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> had indeed appeared there, and endeavoured to disseminate the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> writings and doctrines. <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, however, issued strict edicts against the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> and against the printing and spreading of the writings of the Reformer. The excesses of the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a> evoked the forcible suppression of their movement, and until 1555 the Reformation found little root in the country. In this year <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> granted the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> to his son <a href="../cathen/12001a.htm">Philip II</a>, who resided in the country until 1559. During this period <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> made rapid strides, especially in the northern provinces. Many of the great nobles and the much impoverished lower nobility used the Reformation to incite the liberty-loving people against the king's administration, the Spanish officials and troops, and the strictness of the government. Disaffection continued to increase, owing chiefly to the severe ordinances of the <a href="../cathen/01371a.htm">Duke of Alva</a> and the bloody <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> conducted by him. William of Orange-Nassau, governor of the Province of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, aimed for political reasons at securing the victory for <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>, and succeeded in several of the northern districts. He then placed himself at the head of the rebellion against the Spanish rule. In the ensuing <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> the northern provinces (<em>Niederlande</em>) asserted their independence, whereupon <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> gained in them the ascendancy. In 1581 every public exercise of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> was forbidden. The "Belgian Confession" of 1562 had already a <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> foundation; by the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of Dordrecht in 1574 and 1618 <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> received a fixed form. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the country (about two-fifths of the population) were subjected to <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> suppression. Among the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> conflicts arose concerning the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>.
<h3 id="H">England and Scotland</h3>

<p>The Reformation received its final form in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> during the reign of Queen Elizabeth (1558-1603). On the basis of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a> established in the <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">"Book of Common Prayer"</a> under Edward VI (1547-53) and the confession of Forty-two Articles composed by Archbishop Cranmer and Bishop Ridley in 1552, and after <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a> (1553-58) had failed to restore her country to union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, the ascendancy of <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicanism</a> was established in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> by Elizabeth. The Forty-two Articles were revised, and, as the Thirty-nine Articles of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a>, became in 1562 the norm of its religious <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">creed</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> supremacy of the queen was recognized, an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to this effect (<a href="../cathen/11177a.htm">Oath of Supremacy</a>) being required under penalty of removal from office and loss of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. Several <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> offered resistance, which was overcome by force. The majority of the lower <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> took the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, which was demanded with ever-increasing severity from all members of the House of Commons, all <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, barristers, and teachers. In externals much of the old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> form of worship was retained. After the failure of the movement in favour of <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Stuart of Scotland</a>, who had fled to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1568, the oppression of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was continued with increasing <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. Besides the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Established Church</a> there were in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> <a href="../cathen/11095b.htm">Nonconformists</a>, who opposed a presbyterian popular organization to the episcopal <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>; like the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, they were much oppressed by the rulers of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> the social and political situation gave a great impetus to the Reformation, aided by the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and rudeness of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (to a great extent the result of the constant feuds). The nobility used the Reformation as a weapon in their <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the royal house, which was supported by the higher <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Already under James V (1524-42) supporters of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> doctrines e.g. Patrick Hamilton, Henry Forest, and Alexander Seton, the king's confessor, came forward as Reformers. The first two were executed, while the last fled to the Continent. However, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> doctrines continued to find fresh adherents. On the death of James V his daughter and heiress was only eight days old. The office of regent fell to James Hamilton, who, though previously of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> sentiments, returned to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and supported <a href="../cathen/02374a.htm">Archbishop David Beaton</a> in his energetic measures against the innovators. After the <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">execution</a> of the Reformer George Wishart, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> formed a conspiracy against the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, attacked him in his castle in 1545, and put him to death. The rebels (among them <a href="../cathen/08680a.htm">John Knox</a>), joined by 140 nobles, then fortified themselves in the castle. <a href="../cathen/08680a.htm">Knox</a> went to <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> in 1546, there embraced <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>, and from 1555 was the leader of the Reformation in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, where it won the ascendancy in the form of <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>. The political confusion prevailing in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> from the death of James V facilitated the introduction of the Reformation.

<h2 id="v">Different forms of the Reformation</h2>

<p>The fundamental forms of the Reformation were <a href="../cathen/09458a.htm">Lutheranism</a>, <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwinglianism</a>, <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicanism</a>. Within each of these branches, however, conflicts arose in consequence of the diverse views of individual representatives. By negotiations, compromises, and formulae of union it was sought, usually without lasting success, to establish unity. The whole Reformation, resting on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> authority, presented from the beginning, in the face of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, an aspect of dreary dissension. Besides these chief branches appeared numerous other forms, which deviated from them in essential points, and gradually rise to the countless divisions of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. The chief of these forms may be shortly reviewed.

<ul> <li>The <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a>, who appeared in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and German <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> shortly after the appearance of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>, wished to trace back their conception of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">Apostolic</a> times. They denied the validity of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of children, saw in the Blessed Eucharist merely a memorial <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, and wished to restore the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a> according to their own <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> and <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystical</a> views. Though attacked by the other Reformers, they won supporters in many lands. From them also issued the <a href="../cathen/10190b.htm">Mennonites</a>, founded by Menno Simonis (d. 1561). <li>The <a href="../cathen/13597a.htm">Schwenkfeldians</a> were founded by Kaspar of Schwenkfeld, aulic councillor of Duke Frederick of Liegnitz and canon. At first he associated himself with <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, but from 1525 he opposed the latter in his <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christology</a>, as well as in his conception of the Eucharist, and his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>. Attacked by the German reformers, his followers were able to form but a few communities. The <a href="../cathen/13597a.htm">Schwenkfeldians</a> still maintain themselves in North America. <li>Sebastian Franck (1499-1542), a pure <a href="../cathen/14229a.htm">spiritualist</a>, rejected every external form of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization, and favoured a spiritual, invisible <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He thus abstained from founding a separate community, and sought only to disseminate his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. <li>The <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinians</a> and other Anti-Trinitarians. Some individual members of the early Reformers attacked the fundamental <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a>, especially the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> Miguel Servede (Servetus), whose writing, "De Trinitatis erroribus", printed in 1531, was burned by <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> in <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> in 1553. The chief founders of Anti-Trinitarianism were Laelius Socinus, teacher of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, and his nephew, Faustus Socinus. Compelled to fly from their home, they maintained themselves in various parts, and founded special <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinian</a> communities. Faustus disseminated his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> especially in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> and <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>. <li>Valentine Weigel (1533-1588) and Jacob B&ouml;hme (d. 1624), a shoemaker from Gorlitz, represented a <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystical</a> <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a>, teaching that the external <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> could be recognized only through an internal light. Both found numerous <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. B&ouml;hme's followers later received the name of <em>Rosenkreuzer</em>, because it was widely supposed that they stood under the direction of a hidden guide named Rozenkreuz. <li>The <a href="../cathen/12080c.htm">Pietists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> had as their leader Philip Jacob Spener (1635-1705). <a href="../cathen/12080c.htm">Pietism</a> was primarily a reaction against the barren <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, and regarded religion mainly a thing of the heart. <li>The Inspiration Communities originated in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries with various apocalyptic visionaries. They regarded the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> as arrived, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the universal <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">millennium</a>. Among the founders of such <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visionary</a> societies were Johann Wilhelm Petersen (d. 1727), superintendent at Luneberg, and Johann Konrad Duppel (b. 1734), a physician at Leiden. <li>The Herrnhuter were founded by Count Nicholas of Zinzendorf (b. 1700; d. 1760). On the Hutberg, as it was called, he established the community of Herrnhut, consisting of <a href="../cathen/02616a.htm">Moravian Brethren</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, with a special constitution. Stress was laid on the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a>, and strict <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> discipline was inculcated. This community of <a href="../cathen/02616a.htm">Brethren</a> spread in many lands. <li>The <a href="../cathen/06304b.htm">Quakers</a> were founded by John George Fox of Drayton in Leicestershire (1624-1691). He favoured a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visionary</a> spiritualism, and found in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of each man a portion of the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>. All are allowed to preach, according as the spirit incites them. The <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> were very strict. <li>The <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodists</a> were founded by John Wesley. In 1729 Wesley instituted, with his brother Charles and his friends Morgan and Kirkham, an association at Oxford for the cultivation of the religious and ascetic life, and from this <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodism</a> developed. <li>The <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptists</a> originated in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1608. They maintained that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> only for adults, upheld <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> in its essentials, and observed the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> on Saturday instead of <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a>. <li>The <a href="../cathen/14355a.htm">Swedenborgians</a> are named after their founder Emmanuel Swedenborg (d. 1772), son of a <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Believing in his power to <a href="../cathen/14229a.htm">communicate with the spirit-world</a> and that he had <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">Divine revelations</a>, he proceeded on the basis of the latter to found a community with a special <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a>, the "New Jerusalem". He won numerous followers, and his community spread in many lands. <li>The <a href="../cathen/08174a.htm">Irvingites</a> are called after their founder, Edward Irving, a native of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> and from 1822 preacher in a <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. <li>The <a href="../cathen/10570c.htm">Mormons</a> were founded by Joseph Smith, who made his appearance with supposed <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">revelations</a> in 1822. </ul>

<p>Besides these best-known secondary branches of the Reformation movement, there are many different <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>; for from the Reformation the evolution of new forms has always proceeded, and must always proceed, inasmuch as subjective arbitrariness was made a principle by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> teaching of the sixteenth century.

<h2 id="vi">Results and consequences of the Reformation</h2>

<p>The Reformation destroyed the unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> peoples of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, cut many millions off from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and robbed them of the greatest portion of the salutary means for the cultivation and maintenance of the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> life. Incalculable harm was thereby wrought from the religious standpoint. The <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> fundamental <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, taught by the Reformers, produced a lamentable shallowness in <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">Zeal</a> for good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> disappeared, the <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">asceticism</a> which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had practised from her foundation was despised, <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable</a> and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> objects were no longer properly cultivated, <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> interests fell into the background, and naturalistic aspirations aiming at the purely mundane, became widespread. The denial of the Divinely instituted authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, both as regards <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> government, opened wide the door to every eccentricity, gave rise to the endless division into <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> and the never-ending disputes characteristic of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, and could not but lead to the complete unbelief which necessarily arises from the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> principles. Of real freedom of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> among the Reformers of the sixteenth century there was not a trace; on the contrary, the greatest tyranny in matters of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> was displayed by the representatives of the Reformation. The most baneful Caesaropapism was meanwhile fostered, since the Reformation recognized the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authorities</a> as supreme also in religious matters. Thus arose from the very beginning the various <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> "national Churches", which are entirely discordant with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> universalism of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and depend, alike for their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and organization, on the will of the secular ruler. In this way the Reformation was a chief factor in the evolution of royal absolutism. In every land in which it found ingress, the Reformation was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of indescribable suffering among the people; it occasioned civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> which lasted decades with all their horrors and devastations; the people were oppressed and enslaved; countless treasures of art and priceless <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> were destroyed; between members of the same land and race the seed of discord was sown. <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in particular, the original home of the Reformation, was reduced to a state of piteous distress by the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> was thereby dislodged from the leading position which it had for centuries occupied in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Only gradually, and owing to forces which did not essentially spring from the Reformation, but were conditioned by other historical factors, did the social wounds heal, but the religious corrosion still continues despite the earnest religious sentiments which have at all times characterized many individual followers of the Reformation.
