<h1>The Religion of Russia</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">The origin of Russian Christianity</h2>

<p>There are two theories in regard to the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>; according to one of them, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> was <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> from the times when she embraced <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> until the twelfth century; the other holds that <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> was always Orthodox, i.e., an adherent of the <a href="../cathen/13535a.htm">Greek schism</a>, from the time when <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missionaries first crossed her frontiers.

<p>The first of these theories is held by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, whose arguments were condensed and developed by Vizzardelli ("Dissertatio de origine christian&aelig; religionis in Russia", <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> 1826), and, more amply, by Father Verdi&egrave;re, S.J. ("Origines catholiques de l'&Eacute;glise russe jusqu'au XII<sup>e</sup> si&egrave;cle", Paris, 1856). Russian Orthodox writers unanimously reject the conclusions that Verdi&egrave;re demonstrated in the form of theses, which, to us, appear to be without solid foundations. The history of Russian <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> dates from the ninth century; by which it is not implied that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was entirely unknown to the Russians before that period, for the merchants of Kieff were in frequent communication with Constantinople: one of the quarters of the flourishing <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>, St. Mamante, was inhabited by them, and there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that there were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> among them. On the other hand, some nucleus of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> must have existed at Kieff before Photius, as he himself relates in his encyclical letter to the Patriarchs of the East, sent a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and missionaries to that city. On account of this action, Photius is considered to have introduced <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> into <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. His testimony is repudiated by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers, who claim for St. Ignatius the glory and the initiative of this evangelical mission to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. There are no valid arguments, however, to throw <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> upon the authenticity of the information that has been handed down by Photius, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in the present writer's work "La conversione dei Russi al cristianesimo, e la testimonianza di Fozio", in "Studii religiosi", t. I, 1901, pp. 133-61.

<p>According to the national chronicler Nestor, many Russians were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in 945, and had at Kieff the Church of St. Elias ("La chronique de Nestor", t. I, Paris, 1834, p. 65). In 955 Olga, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Igor, went to Constantinople, where she was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the Patriarch Poliutus (956-70), and, loaded with rich gifts that she received from Constantine Porphyrogenitus (912-59), she returned to Kieff, and devoted herself to the conversion of her fellow-countrymen. The <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> between the Churches of the East and of the West was not yet accomplished; and therefore Olga, who received in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the name of Helen, is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a saint also by the United <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>. Western chroniclers relate that Olga sent an embassy to the <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Emperor Otto I</a>, to ask for Latin missionaries, and that Otto charged Adaldag, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, to satisfy that request. Adaldag <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Russians Libutius, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the Convent of St. Albano, who died before entering <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. He was succeeded by Adalbertus, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/10077a.htm">St. Maximinus</a>, at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russians</a>, however, received the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> badly, killed several of his companions, and constrained him to return to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. It may be observed that Assemani and Karamzin do not admit that Latin missionaries came to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> with Adalbertus.

<p>The efforts of Olga to convert her son Sviatoslaff to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> were unsuccessful. Vladimir, son of Sviatoslaff, has the glory of having established <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> as the official State religion in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. According to the legend, Vladimir received <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a>, Latin, and Greek <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, who urged him to adopt their respective <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>. The Greeks finally triumphed. Vladimir marched with an army towards the Taurida, and in 998 took Kherson; then he sent ambassadors to the Emperors Basilius and Constantine, asking for the hand of their sister Anna, which he obtained on condition that he would become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Kherson, who, according to Russian chroniclers, made Vladimir read a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that was hostile to the "corrupt" <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Latins. Thereafter, taking with him the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of Pope St. Clement and of that <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> disciple, Phebus, as well as <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> and images, Vladimir returned to Kieff, accompanied by his consort, and by some Greek missionaries. Once there he caused the idol of Perun to be thrown into the Dnieper, and on the site that it occupied built a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> church, also commanding that all his subjects, without distinction of age, should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. The inhabitants of Kieff yielded before his threats; but those of Novgorod resisted and suffered severe treatment. The <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russians</a> were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, but they did not receive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> instruction and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>; the ancient <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and habits of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Paganism</a> endured, and survived for many centuries; consequently the moral influence of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was not efficiently exercised upon the Russian people. Vladimir erected a church in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, under the direction of <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Grecian</a> artists. Thanks to his solicitude, the Russian Church was endowed with a <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. At first this <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was Greek; the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> were appointed and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, went to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> as foreigners, and remained such. They succeeded, however, in inspiring the Russians with <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> Leontius (dead in 1004), George (1072), Ivan II (dead in 1089), and Nicephorus I (1103-21) wrote the first polemical works of Russian literature against the Latins.


<h2 id="section2">Catholicism in Russia, from the twelfth century to the Council of Florence</h2>

<p>Although the Russian Church in its earliest periods was completely dominated by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Constantinople who made the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, the relations between Russian princes and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, begun under Vladimir, subsisted for several centuries. Russian documents testify that Vladimir in 991 sent an embassy to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and that three embassies went from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to Kieff, sent by <a href="../cathen/08427c.htm">John XV</a> (985-96), and by Sylvester II (999-1003). A German chronicler, <a href="../cathen/05047d.htm">Dithmar</a>, relates that a Saxon missionary, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, went to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, where he preached the Gospel, and was killed with eighteen of his companions on 14 Feb., 1002. At about that time Reinbert, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Kolberg, went to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> with the daughter of Boleslaus the Intrepid, bride of Sviatopolk, the son of Vladimir. He strove to diffuse <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and died a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>. Other missionaries continued their Apostolic efforts; but <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> was already lost to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. The Metropolitan Nicephorus I (1103-21) regarded the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> as <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a>, and reproached it with a long list of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. Russian canonical documents of the twelfth century refer to the Latins as <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, and prohibit all relations with them. The most virulent <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> were inserted in the "Kormtchaia kniga"; and Russian <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> down to Isidor (1437) had no relations with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>This does not mean to say, however, that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> neglected <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> as a field for its apostolate; for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> always tried to lead her back to the centre of unity, and to enter into relations with her princes. The prince Iziaslaff Yaroslavitch (1054-68; 1069-73; 1076-78) sent his son to <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, asking the assistance of that pontiff, and promising to make <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> a vassal of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> answered him by letter of 17 April, 1075. Under the Grand Duke Vsevolod Yaroslavitch (1078-93) there was established the feast of the translation of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/11063b.htm">St. Nicholas of Bari</a>, approved by <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> (1088-99), who in 1091 sent to the same prince Bishop Teodoro, with <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. In 1080 the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Clement III</a> sent a letter to the Metropolitan Ivan II (dead in 1089), proposing to the latter the union of the Russian Church; Ivan answered, however, enumerating the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of the Latins (Marcovitch attributes this letter to the Metropolitan Ivan IV, who, according to Golubinsky, died in 1166). <a href="../cathen/04018a.htm">Clement III</a> (1187-91) sent a letter to the Grand Prince Vsevolod and to the Metropolitan Nicephorus II (1182-97), inviting them to take part in the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a>, but in vain. <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> (1198-1216) sent two legations to the princes of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, exhorting them to be reunited to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Under <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> (1216-1227) <a href="../cathen/07591b.htm">St. Hyacinth</a>, with other religious of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a>, preached the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in southern <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Kieff, while a religious of the same order in 1232 was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that city, out of which, however, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> were driven in 1233. Another letter of <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>, and one of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> (1227-41) encouraged the Russians of Pskof to realize their intention of embracing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. All of these efforts were in vain, it was only in Galicia that the solicitude of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> was attended with some favourable results. <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> (1243-54) had continuous relations with the Grand Prince Daniel Romanovitch (1229-64), who hoped for the assistance of the West to throw off the Tatar yoke; the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> to the King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> in 1254 <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> the grand prince as king at the city of Dorogtchin. But through dissension among the princes of the West the assistance that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> promised to Daniel was not given, and in 1256 the latter repudiated his union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> made efforts to convert to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> the national hero, Alexander Nevski, whose father had <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> before the pontifical <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> Giovanni da Pian Carpino. In 1248 <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> wrote to the Prince Alexander Nevski, exhorting the latter to embrace <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>; and in another letter the same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> asserts that the conversion of that prince took place. Russian writers however are unanimous in considering their national hero a champion of the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, who refused to submit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>Under <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> (1316-34) <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> was propagated in <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a>, where it had its <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Gedimin (1315-45), although a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>, wrote a letter to <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, declaring that <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> were authorized to preach in his principality. <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Paganism</a> was firmly rooted in the people, and in 1332 fourteen <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> were massacred at <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>. In 1323 the same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> re-established the Latin Diocese of Kieff, to which he appointed a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> became preponderant in <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a>, when Hedwig, Queen of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, married Jagello, and the two states were united into a single kingdom. Jagello embraced <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in 1386, called Polish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a>, and, like Vladimir the Great, resorted to <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to convert his subjects. Many Russians were converted to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and Vilna became the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p>In 1436 the Russian Church, which was still dependent upon Constantinople, had as <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> Isidor (1436-41), a Greek, native of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, and staunch adherent of the cause of the union. This <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> on 8 Sept., 1437, with Avraam, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Suzdal, and many <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, went to the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>, where he ardently defended the union; and by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 17 Aug., 1438, <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> named him <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> <em>a latere</em> for Lithuania, Livonia, and <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Avraam of Suzdal, however, was not a partizan of the union; and leaving Isidor, returned alone to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Isidor sent an <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">encyclical</a> letter to the Russians (5 March, 1440), extolling the union that had been concluded at Florence. Upon his return to <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, however, Prince Vasili Vasilevitch convened a council, condemned the work of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> the latter in the Monastery of the Miracles (Tchudoff); but Isidor succeeded in making his escape, and found asylum in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Wherefore, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> did not accept the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of union of the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>; on the contrary, she drew from it arguments to proclaim the superiority of her Orthodox <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> over the pliant <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Greeks, and to prepare the way for her religious autonomy.

<p>Isidor resigned the Metropolitan See of Kieff about 1458, and in the same year <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> appointed Gregor the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a>, who was a disciple and companion of the former <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, and who, according to the historian Golubinski, remained united to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> until 1470, after which he became Orthodox, and died in 1472. Among his successors who were friendly to the union were Mikhail Drucki (1475-80), Semion (1481-88), Jonah Glezna (1492-94), Makap (1495-97), and Josef Soltan, who in 1500 wrote a letter to <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> asking for <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation of his <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> dignity. At the death of Josef II, which according to Stroeff was in 1519, the Metropolitanate of Kieff became again wholly Orthodox.

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>, the fanaticism of the Russians in regard to the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> increased. The Latins were not even considered citizens. They were not allowed to build churches in Russian cities. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, however, did not cease their efforts to effect a reconciliation between <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a>. An event that should have hastened the attainment of that end served only to widen the breach between Orthodoxy and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. There lived at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under the tutelage of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and the spiritual guidance of <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Cardinal Bessarion</a> the Greek Princess Zoe, daughter of Thomas Pal&aelig;ologus, Despot of Morea; and <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a>, wishing ardently to induce the Russians to join the princes of the West in a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, proposed to offer the hand of Zoe to Ivan Vasilevitch III (1462-1505); but death overtook him before he was able to bring about the realization of his purpose. <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> (1471-84) continued the policy of his predecessor. Ivan III received the proposal with enthusiasm. On 12 Nov., 1472 Zoe with a numerous suite arrived at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, and the Metropolitan Philip I (1464-73) united her in marriage with Ivan. But the hopes of union to which this marriage had given rise vanished. Ivan would not hear the propositions of the Bishop Antonio, who as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> had accompanied Zoe; while the latter passed over to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. Ivan III and the Russians thought only of drawing profit from the good will of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. The grand prince, having married a princess of the imperial house of Pal&aelig;ologus, formulated claims to the throne of Byzantium; while the Russians began to regard <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> as the third <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which should inherit the prerogatives of the first and of the second.

<p>Several embassies of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> and of <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> to the Prince Basil Ivanovitch (1505-33) were without favourable results for the union. <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a> and <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> invited Ivan the Terrible to send delegates to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>; while <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> in his turn invited him to join a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> but Sigismund, King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and Maximilian II, Emperor of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, prevented the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> from crossing the Russian frontiers, or rendered their missions fruitless. In 1580 Ivan the Terrible, menaced by the victorious arms of B&aacute;thori, King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> (1576-86), and of the Swedes, sent to <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> an embassy at the head of which was Leontius Tchevrigin. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, although placing little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the promises of the tsar, sent to <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> one of the most eminent men of his day, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/12317a.htm">Antonio Possevino</a>, who, on 22 Feb., 1582, had a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> disputation with the tsar. <a href="../cathen/12317a.htm">Possevino</a> was well received at the Court of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, but his apostolic efforts were without result. He returned on 15 March, 1582, in company with Jacob Molvianinoff, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of the tsar, and bearer of a letter to <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>. In that letter Ivan the Terrible did not refer to the union. <a href="../cathen/12317a.htm">Possevino</a> had relations also with the successor of Ivan, Feodor Ivanovitch, and with Constantine II, Prince of Ostrog, the great champion of Orthodoxy in the sixteenth century; always, however, with unfavourable results. The advent of the False Demetrius and his marriage with the heiress of the Waywodes of <a href="../cathen/13436b.htm">Sandomir</a> gave hopes that <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> would see a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> dynasty on its throne. Demetrius, indeed, had been converted to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in 1604, and had entered into relations with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, which, through its <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a> in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, proceeded to confirm him in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and to maintain his devotion to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. Demetrius gave to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiest</a> hopes for the conversion of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>; but through a conspiracy on 27 May, 1606 he lost the crown and his life. Fanatical Russian writers charge the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> with responsibility for the turbulence that followed the advent to the throne of the False Demetrius; but the letters of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiffs</a> refute that <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> decisively.

<p>In 1675 the Tsar Alexis (1645-76) sent, as ambassador to <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a>, General Paul Menesius, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. The object of this embassy was to promote an alliance of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. The Russian <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> was received with great distinction. No <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> results, however, attended his mission from a religious point of view. During the reign of Alexis, strenuous efforts were made to draw <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> towards <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> by a famous Croatian missionary, George Krizhanitch, a student of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, on whose life and works Professor Bielokuroff recently wrote several valuable volumes rich in documents. Krizhanitch is regarded as one of the pioneers of Panslavism; but his efforts to bring <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cost him, in 1661, an exile to <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a>, whence he was unable to return to <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> until 1676, after the death of Alexis.

<p>In 1684 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> Schmidt established himself at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the embassy from <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. In 1685 another <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, Father Albert Debois was the bearer of a letter from <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> to the Tsar; and in 1687 Father Giovanni Vota, also of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, advocated at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> the need of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> to unite herself to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The Emperor of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Leopold I (1657-1705), obtained permission for the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to open a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, where they established a house. Their work would have been very favourable for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, for under the influence of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> a band of learned Orthodox <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, led by the <em>hiqumeno</em> Sylvester Medvedeff, supported certain Latin doctrines, especially the <em><a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a></em>. Unfortunately however two fanatical Greek <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, Joannikius and Sophronius Likhudes, excited the fanaticism of the Russians against the Latins at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, and when Peter the Great freed himself of the tutelage of his sister Sophia in 1689, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were expelled from <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> Patriarch Joachim, a man actuated by <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for foreigners, and in particular for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, had much to do with that expulsion. The reforms of Peter the Great did not better the condition of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. In the first years of his reign he showed deference to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; he granted permission to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in 1691 to build a church at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, and to summon <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> for its service; in 1707 he sent an embassy to <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, to induce that <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pontiff</a> not to recognize Stanislaus Leszczynski as King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, to which dignity the latter had been elected by the Diet of <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a> on 12 July, 1704; he promised the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgate</a> a constitution that would establish, in favour of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, the freedom of worship that had been promised, but never maintained. During his sojourn at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1717 he received from various <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the Sorbonne a scheme for the union, to which he caused Theophanus Prokopovitch and Stepan Gavorski to reply in 1718. In order to captivate the Russians, the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the Sorbonne had worked Gallican <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> into that scheme, regarding the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and his authority.

<p>Peter the Great, however, was inimical to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. His religious views were influenced by Prokopovitch, a man of great learning, but a courtier by nature, and a bitter enemy of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. Peter the Great revealed his anti-Catholic <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> when, at Polotsk in 1705, he killed with his own hand the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> Theophanus Kolbieczynski, as also by many other measures; he caused the most offensive <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> to be disseminated in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>; he expelled the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1719; he issued ukases to draw <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to Orthodoxy, and to prevent the children of <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> from being <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; and finally, he celebrated in 1722 and in 1725 monstrous orgies as parodies of the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a>, casting ridicule on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the Roman court.

<p>From the time of Peter the Great to Alexander I, the history of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> is a continuous struggle against Russian legislation: <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> that embarrassed the action of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> that favoured the apostasy of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and reduced the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to impotence were multiplied each year, and constituted a <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Neronian</a> code. In 1727, to put a stop to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> propaganda in the Government of Smolensk, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were prohibited from entering that province, or, having entered it, were prohibited from occupying themselves with religious matters; the nobility was forbidden to leave the Orthodox communion, to have <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers, to go to foreign countries, or to marry <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. In 1735 the Empress Anna Ivanovna prohibited <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> propaganda among Orthodox Russians under the severest penalties. Illustrious converts, like Alexei Ladygenski and Mikhail Galitzin, were treated with the most inhuman barbarity on account of their conversion. In 1747 the government expelled from Astrakhan the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> who were making many conversions to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> among the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>.

<p>Under Catharine II (1762-96) the condition of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> became worse than before, notwithstanding the ukases of religious tolerance that the empress <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>. The ukase of 22 July, 1763 authorized the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to build <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> and churches of stone. Another ukase of 23 Feb., 1769 <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the ecclesiastical constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. This constitution established two <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, at St. Petersburg and <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, and placed them in charge of the Reformed <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>. It provided that the number of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> should not be greater than nine; and it strictly prohibited <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, residing in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, from proselytizing among Orthodox Russians.

<p>The first dismemberment of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> (1772) brought a strong body of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and Catharine II proposed to make of them a national Church, independent of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Unfortunately an ambitious Polish <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Stanislaus Siestrzencewicz, entered into her views, and a ukase of 23 May, 1774 established the Diocese of White Russia, with its <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> at <a href="../cathen/10428a.htm">Mohileff</a>, its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> being Siestrzencewicz, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>. This personage is judged variously by historians. Pierling, Zalenski, and Markovitch treat him as an ambitious man who sought to become patriarch of all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and who in his heart <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a>. Godlewski on the contrary is inclined to excuse him, and to believe that the difficult conditions of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, possibly led him to adopt measures that appear to have been injurious to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests. According to Markovitch, during his long episcopate (1774-1826), Siestrzencewicz was the scourge of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of both rites in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. By her manifestos of 1779 Catharine II began the systematic destruction of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, withdrawing them from the authority of their religious superiors, and putting them under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10428a.htm">Mohileff</a>. The latter in 1782 was raised to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> dignity, and in 1784 received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> from the Apostolic Legate, Mgr. Giovanni Andrea Archetti, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03554a.htm">Chalcedon</a>. He assumed episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the Russian Empire, and acted as if he were independent of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>The sound principles of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, however, were maintained and propagated by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> who, suppressed by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and exiled from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> nations, found an asylum and the centre of their future revival in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. In 1779 Catharine II invited the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to exercise their ministry in White Russia, and in 1786 they had in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> six colleges and 178 members. Their number increased so much that <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> re-established their order for <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, where it returned to life under Father Gruber. In 1801 the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> had 262 members, and 347 in 1811. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> retained a lively gratitude for the hospitality that they had received in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and worked with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> to convert it to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>.

<p>The Second and Third Partitions of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> (1793-94) considerably increased the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>; Catharine II promised them the free exercise of their religion, their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and those of their Church, and their complete independence of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>. These promises were deceptive, as was shown by the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Church, accomplished by her order. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> also soon had cause to remember that they were under the domination of implacable enemies. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had awaited the death of Catharine and the advent to the throne of Paul I (1796-1801), to better their condition. In 1797 <a href="../cathen/09293a.htm">Archbishop Lorenzo Litta</a>, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> <em>a latere</em> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, arrived at St. Petersburg, where he was received with great honours. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who had been exiled to Siberia were recalled; the Sees of <a href="../cathen/09463b.htm">Lutzk</a>, <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>, Kamenetz, <a href="../cathen/10333a.htm">Minsk</a>, and Samogitia (the ancient Diocese of Livonia) were created; the archiepiscopal See of <a href="../cathen/10428a.htm">Mohileff</a> was declared <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, which it still is; and the government granted an indemnity to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> that had been taken from them. In 1802 the number of the faithful amounted to 1,635,490, of adults alone. Paul I showed a special predilection for the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and reposed great confidence in Father Gruber; he called them to St. Petersburg, where he authorized them to open <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, while he obtained from <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> (7 March, 1801), re-establishing the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>.

<p>Under Alexander I diplomatic relations were established between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the Russian Government. In 1802 a Russian legation was established at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, while <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> on his part named an <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">Apostolic nuncio</a> to St. Petersburg, Mgr. Arezzo, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a>. The affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> were to be administered by the Roman <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Ecclesiastical College, created in imitation of the Synod of St. Petersburg. This college had been approved by Alexander I, through his ukase of 21 Nov., 1801. Siestrzencewicz of course was selected as its president; and the Russian Government, in its Note of 13 Dec., 1803, asked of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> such powers for him as would have rendered him independent. The Sovereign Pontiff opposed a determined resistance to these demands, and the Ecclesiastical College was henceforward merely a name. In 1804 Mgr. Arezzi, the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">Apostolic nuncio</a>, in view of the disagreements between the Russian Government and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, left St. Petersburg; whereupon Siestrzencewicz had a free hand, and devoted himself to discrediting <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> by proposing as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the vacant sees men who were corrupt or allied to the government, by persecuting the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, by granting <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorces</a> arbitrarily, by favouring the English Bible Society, and finally, by surrounding himself with assistants of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> mind and heart. Diplomatic relations between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> were resumed in 1815. The Russian plenipotentiary, Baron de Tuyll, had colloquies with Cardinal della Somaglia in regard to the union of the two Churches, which, however, were without result, for the Russian Government declared that the union was impossible so long as the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> wished to impose its dogmatic teachings and its disciplinary practices upon the Russians. Meanwhile, Siestrzencewicz made use of the renewal of relations between <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and St. Petersburg to seek through the Russian Government new favours and concessions, e.g. the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of episcopal candidates by the tsar, the title of Primate, matrimonial <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a>, etc. In other words, it was a question of imitating the canonical legislation of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, and of harnessing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> to the car of the State. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> merely granted to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/10428a.htm">Mohileff</a> the honorary title of <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>, without any additional <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and authorized a small number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to administer the Sacrament of Confirmation with oil blessed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The various efforts of the Russian Government to establish a <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>, with patriarchal, almost I independent powers in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> were always thwarted by the determined resistance of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>The most painful occurrence in the history of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> during the reign of Alexander I was the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> from <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, the pretext for which was the conversion of Prince Alexander Galitzin to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were expelled from St. Petersburg during the night of 22-23 Dec., 1815, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Catharine was given to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were relegated to Polotsk; later, however, by the ukase of 25 March, 1820, they were exiled from Russian territory. On the other hand, as many nobles of the former Polish provinces, subjects of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, sent their children abroad to be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, the government provided that young <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> should not leave <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. In the last years of his reign Alexander I showed more sympathy for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and the relations of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> with the Russian Government were cordial during the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> and the sojourn of the Chevalier Italinski at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as Russian minister. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> obtained the concession that the Russian Government would pay to the Datary 1000 <em>scudi</em> for the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and 800 <em>scudi</em> for those of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; Alexander I also allowed a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> to be erected at the imperial residence of Tsarskoye Selo, and gave 40,000 roubles for its construction. He proposed to visit <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and, according to an unauthenticated historical report, to <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjure</a> Orthodoxy. There are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers who affirm that Alexander I and his consort became <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; but there is no documentary evidence in support of this.

<p>The reign of Nicholas I was a long period of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and suffering for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. In 1826 the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> sent Mgr. Bernetti to St. Petersburg, to be present at the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a>. He was well received by the tsar, and thereafter wrote optimistically to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Soon, however, the trials of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> began. By two ukases in 1828 the admission of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, and of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, was made very difficult, if not quite impossible; and in the following year all the novitiates were closed. In 1830 other ukases encouraged <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, prohibited <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religious propaganda among the Orthodox, the hearing the confessions of foreigners, and changes of residence among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>.

<p>The Polish insurrection of 1830 and 1831 intensified the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> against the Latin <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In 1832 the Russian Government asked of the "Roman Ecclesiastical College" that the number of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> be diminished. Of 300 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10428a.htm">Diocese of Mohileff</a> 202 were closed; while the administrator of that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, Bishop Szczyt, who had opposed this reduction was sent to Siberia. In the same year the publication of <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal</a> <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> was prohibited. In June and September, 1832 respectively the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> addressed two notes to the Russian Government, lamenting the disabilities to which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were subjected in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and the innovations which had been introduced into <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>. The government blamed the Polish revolutionists for its severity. On 9 June, 1832, yielding to the Russian Government, <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> addressed his <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> to the Polish <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, urging obedience to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> in civil matters. The encyclical aroused great discontent among the Poles, and did not deter the Russian Government from its purpose of annihilating <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. The Government directed its blows against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, more especially by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, by preventing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from ministering to the United <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and by calling to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> men who were devoted to its policy, e.g. Mgr. Pawlowski, who was named <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10428a.htm">Mohileff</a> in 1841. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> could no longer remain silent in the presence of this <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and in his Allocution to the solemn <a href="../cathen/04285a.htm">Consistory</a> of 22 July, 1842, <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> called the attention of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world to the painful oppression to which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> was subjected in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>; and his protests were more serious and energetic, when in 1845, upon the occasion of the visit of the tsar to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he had an interview with the latter which resulted in the concordat of 3 Aug., 1847, by which there were established in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> and six <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, the same number of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> that had been established by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> of 30 June, 1818. The concordat repealed several iniquitous <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> that had been <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, placed the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> academy of St. Petersburg under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the ordinary, and recognized to a somewhat greater degree the authority of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> over the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The Tsar Nicholas, by a letter of 15 Nov., 1847, ratified the concordat of 3 Aug., which, like so many other Russian <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> was destined to remain a dead Letter. Obstacles were placed to the determination of the boundaries of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>; 21 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> were suppressed by a ukase of 18 July, 1850; while <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were prohibited from restoring their churches and from building new ones; from preaching sermons that had not previously been approved by the government, and from refuting the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> of the Press against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. It is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for us to recur to the authority of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers, like Lesc&oelig;ur, to prove how odious this <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> was; we may be satisfied with a mere glance at the immense collection of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and governmental measures concerning the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, from the times of Peter and of Ivan Alexeievitch to 1867 ("Zakonopolozhenija i pravitelstvennyia rasporjazhenija do rimsko-kato litcheskoi cerkvi v Rossii otnosjachtchijasja so vremeni carstvovanija Tzarei Petra i Ioanna Aleksieevitchei, 1669-1867", Vienna, 1868). It is not without reason that a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writer has said that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of Nicholas I against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> constitute a <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Neronian</a> code.

<p>The first years of the reign of Alexander II were not marked by anti-Catholic <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. The Russian Government promised the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> that the concordat would be scrupulously observed, and in 1856 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> were filled. Soon however there was a return to the methods of Nicholas I, notwithstanding the fact that <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> wrote to the tsar, imploring liberty for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of both rites in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. In another letter, addressed in 1861 to Mgr. Fialkowski, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> referred to the continual efforts of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to safeguard the existence of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and to the difficulties that were opposed to all measures of his and of his predecessors in that connection. Encouraged by the words of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the Polish <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> presented a memorandum to the representative of the emperor at <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, asking for the abrogation of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> that oppressed <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and destroyed their liberty. A similar memorandum was presented to the tsar by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10428a.htm">Mohileff</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Upon the basis of these memoranda, the government accused the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of promoting the spirit of revolution and of plotting revolts against the tsar. Most painful occurrences ensued; the soldiery was not restrained from profaning the churches and the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, from wounding defenceless <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, or from treating Warsaw as a city taken by storm. One hundred and sixty <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and among them the <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a> Bialobrzeski, were taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>, and several of them were exiled to Siberia. Mgr. Deckert, coadjutor of the Archbishop Fialkowski, died of the sufferings that these events caused him. The condition of the Poles were becoming intolerable, and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> suffered proportionately. Amid the general indifference of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, one voice, that of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, was raised, firm and energetic, in favour of an oppressed people and of a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. On 12 March, 1863, in his Allocution to the <a href="../cathen/04285a.htm">Consistory</a>, and on 22 April, 1863, in a letter to the tsar, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> demanded that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and equity be no longer violated. The tsar Alexander II wrote to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> expressing regrets that the Polish <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> should ally itself with the authors of civil disorder and should disturb the public peace.

<p>The Polish revolution of 1863 furnished the government with a pretext for inhumanity towards the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, both regular and secular. There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that some <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and religious, moved by patriotic ardour, committed the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of taking part in an insurrection which was opposed by the more cultured and reasonable portion of the nation. The Russian Government, however, did not take pains to punish only the guilty, but dealt with all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> alike. In 1863 the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, Mgr. Felinski, was confined at Yaroslaff, as was his coadjutor Mgr. Rzaewuski at Astrakhan in 1865; while their successors, the canons Szczygielski and Domagolski, were exiled to Siberia in 1867. Mgr. Krasinski, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>, was confined at Vyatka. Several <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in 1863 were either hanged or shot, as implicated in the revolt, while others were sent to the interior of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, or were deported to Siberia. The Poles and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in their distress received consolation only from <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, who distinguished between the right of a government to punish an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> revolt and the right of subjects to profess their Faith freely. In the encyclical "Ubi Urbaniano" of 30 July, 1864, addressed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, he enumerated the grievous evils that the Russian Government had inflicted on <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>.

<p>The letters and the protests of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> however were of little avail. On 8 Nov., 1864 the government suppressed the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of Russian <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>; and a ukase of 16 Nov., 1866 abolished the concordat of 1847. Another ukase, on 22 May, 1867, made the "Roman <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> College" the intermediary between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Unfortunately some <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> allowed themselves to be led astray by the promises or by the threats of the Russian Government, which sought the ruin of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> through the establishment of a Polish national church. We may cite Mgr. Staniewski, administrator of the <a href="../cathen/10428a.htm">Diocese of Mohileff</a>, Mgr. Constance Lubienski, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Augustowo, who nobly expiated his mistake, and died in exile at D&uuml;naburg; and Mgr. Sosnowski, administrator of the <a href="../cathen/09403a.htm">Diocese of Lublin</a>. A series of curious revelations and documents, concerning the incredible abuses of Russian legislation against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, is contained in the work "Das polnisch-russische Staatskirchenrecht auf Grund der neuesten Bestimmungen und praktischer Erfahrungen systematisch erz&auml;hlt von einem Priester", Posen, 1892.

<p>Under Alexander III (1881-94) negotiations between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the Russian Government were renewed, and <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> maintained a legation at the Vatican. In 1882 Archbishop Felinski was recalled from exile, and, instead of his See of <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, received the title of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>. The See of <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a> was given to Mgr. Vincent Theophilus Popiel, who had energetically resisted the efforts of the Russian Government to establish an independent <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> college for the government of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. A new concordat was concluded in 1882, but its clauses were nullified by new <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. It should not be forgotten that, during the entire reign of Alexander II, the religious policy of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> was inspired by Konstantin Pobiedonostseff, Procurator General of the Holy Synod, who, for political rather than religious motives, was a fierce adversary of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> continued to endure the severest oppression, abandoned to the caprices of the police, greatly reduced in numbers, and trammelled by a thousand obstacles in the exercise of its apostolic ministry. This condition of things was prolonged into the reign of Nicholas II, during which Pobiedonostseff exercised his dictatorship until 1905.

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, however, and in consequence of internal political troubles, Nicholas II <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the constitution in 1905, and published the edict of <a href="../cathen/14763a.htm">religious toleration</a>. Two years of liberty were sufficient to reveal the great vitality of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, for the number of conversions to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in so short a lapse of time, amounted to 500,000, including over 300,000 Uniate <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> whom the Russian Government had compelled to declare themselves Orthodox; 100,000 of these, known in Russian as <em>Obstinates</em> (<em>uporstvujushshie</em>) had not received the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> for more than thirty years, during which time they frequented no church, in order not to be reckoned among the Orthodox. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> developed the greatest activity in social and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work, in the Press, and in the awakening of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; and the reactionary party of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, centred in the Synod, cried out against the danger, and called for new <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> to protect Orthodoxy against the assaults of militant <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. These protests and lamentations were heard; the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> relating to liberty of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> were submitted to revision, abolished, or modified; the government refused to recognize as legitimate the conversions to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> of the former Uniate <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> children of <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> were punished with fines and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>; the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were closed; the confraternities and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> social organizations were dissolved, and the former severity against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press was resumed. The government directed its action especially against the re-establishment of the United Church in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and in 1911 closed two <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Russo-Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> that had been erected at St. Petersburg and <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>. Denunciations against a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, Father Werczynski, who had established himself at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> in 1903, and had converted a thousand Russians to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, furnished the government with pretexts for renewed severity: Father Werczynski was exiled; the suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10428a.htm">Mohileff</a>, Mgr. Denisewicz, was deposed (1911) without the previous consent of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and was deprived of his stipend; and another most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, Baron von. Ropp, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to resign his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> and to retire to the Government of Perm.

<p>Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> continues to exercise a great influence upon the cultured classes of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, a fact due in great measure to Vladimir Soloveff, the greatest of Russian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, who has rightly been called the Russian <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>; and from these classes there have always been conversions that have brought to the fold of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> noble and exalted <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, as, for example, Princess Narishkin, Princess Bariatinski, Princess Volkonski, Countess Nesselrode, Miss Ushakova, <a href="../cathen/06334a.htm">Prince Gagarin</a>, <a href="../cathen/06367b.htm">Prince Galitzin</a>, Count Shuvaloff, and many others. Khomiakoff, the legislator and apostle of Slavophilism, said that if liberty of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> were established in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> the upper and the cultured classes would embrace <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, which seems to be justified by the facts.
<h2 id="section4">Statistics of the Catholic dioceses of Russia</h2>

<p>The basis for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> statistics of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> is furnished by the very useful "Elenchi omnium Ecclesiarum et universi cleri" which is published every year by the various <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> as an appendix to the "Directorium divini officii". These "Elenchi" are useful not only for their statistics but also for their historical data, because they sometimes contain documents and historical notes concerning the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. From the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> point of view, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> are divided into two classes: the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and those of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>.

<p>The Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, or Russian <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, has seven sees: <ul><li>(1) <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Archdiocese of Warsaw</a>; <li>(2) <a href="../cathen/08636a.htm">Diocese of Kielce</a>; <li>(3) <a href="../cathen/09403a.htm">Diocese of Lublin</a> (with administration of Podlachia); <li>(4) <a href="../cathen/12166b.htm">Diocese of Plock</a>; <li>(5) <a href="../cathen/13436b.htm">Diocese of Sandomir</a>; <li>(6) <a href="../cathen/13688a.htm">Diocese of Sejny</a> and Augustowo; <li>(7) <a href="../cathen/15680b.htm">Diocese of Wladislaw</a>.</ul>

<p>In <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> there are: <ul><li>(1) <a href="../cathen/10428a.htm">Archdiocese of Mohileff</a> (with administration of <a href="../cathen/10333a.htm">Minsk</a>); <li>(2) <a href="../cathen/09463b.htm">Diocese of Lutzk, Zhitomir, and Kamenetz</a>; <li>(3) <a href="../cathen/13421b.htm">Diocese of Samogitia</a>; <li>(4) <a href="../cathen/14739a.htm">Diocese of Tiraspol</a>; <li>(5) <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Diocese of Vilna</a>.</ul>

<p>These are all treated under separate heads. In 1866 the Russian Government suppressed the Diocese of Podlachia in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and Minsk and Kamenetz in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>; the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, however, did not sanction these arbitrary acts, and therefore the three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in question exist canonically, although they have no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and have been incorporated into other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. There are in the Russian Empire more than 13,000,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of whom more than 5,000,000 are in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>; there are approximately 2900 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 3300 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 2000 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and 4600 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. According to the illustrative tables of Father Urban, S.J., there may be reckoned an average of more than 3000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> for each <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. In some <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, as for example in Podlachia, there is 1 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for each 4800 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; and in the <a href="../cathen/10333a.htm">Diocese of Minsk</a> 1 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for each 4670 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The division into <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> is irregular, and some of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> have a very large population; that of Holy Cross at Lodz has a population of 142,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with only 10 priests; and Praga, near <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, has 82,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with only 4 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. In Siberia the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> have an enormous extent. According to the convention between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the Government, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should have 22 auxiliaries: 3 for the metropolitanate of <a href="../cathen/10428a.htm">Mohileff</a>; 3 for the Diocese of Kovno; 3 for Lutzk, Zhitomir, and Kamenetz; 3 for Vilna; 2 for Tiraspol; 2 for Warsaw; and 1 each for Kielce, <a href="../cathen/09403a.htm">Lublin</a>, <a href="../cathen/15680b.htm">Wladislaw</a>, <a href="../cathen/13436b.htm">Sandomir</a>, <a href="../cathen/12166b.htm">Plock</a>, and Sejny and Augustowo. Unfortunately however the convention is not observed by the Russian Government: in 1911 there were only four suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; and it should be added that the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> remain vacant for long periods. The <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Diocese of Vilna</a> has been vacant since 1905. There follows consequently great disorganization and many abuses in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration, which cannot be remedied for lack of competent authority.

<p>Each diocese has its <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and its collegiate chapters. A ukase of 1865 fixed 12 as the number of canons of a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Each diocese has also its consistory; and to the twelve <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> consistories, should be added the consistories of Kalish, Piotrkow, and Pultusk. The consistories are composed of "Officers", "vice-officers", assessors, visitors of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and also lay members in the Russian <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The efforts of the Russian Government to make autonomous the consistories of the various <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> college at St. Petersburg have failed, for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, taught by experience, remains faithful to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a>, and accepts no innovations contrary to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> canon law.
<h2 id="section5">Religious orders</h2>

<p>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries there were in Russian <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and several thousand religious of the various orders. Among the latter the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarists</a> (founded by St. Joseph Calasanctius) distinguished themselves by their services to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>; but the iniquitous <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of Catharine II and Nicholas I, and the measures adopted by the Russian Government in 1864 after the Polish insurrection, almost extirpated Western monachism from <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. In 1864 it was provided that the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> should be divided into two classes, those approved kind recognized by the state, and those not approved or recognized. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the first of these two classes were allowed to have <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, and to be inhabited each by 14 religious; those of the second class were allowed to remain in existence until the number of religious in each should be reduced to 7, when the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was to be suppressed. The opening of the novitiates of the recognized <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> was deferred to the time when the non-approved <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> should have ceased to exist. The number of the <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulist</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Czenstochowa was fixed at twenty-four. Even these restrictive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> however, were not observed. Only three or four of the recognized <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were allowed to receive <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, and the members of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders were prohibited from having relations with their religious superiors outside of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. It is therefore not astonishing that the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders should have nearly disappeared from that country. The Sisters of Charity alone have been able to develop their organization; and, as elsewhere, they have won the admiration of all, even of the Orthodox.

<p>The greater part of the religious are in Russian <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Archdiocese of Warsaw</a> has a <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Nowe Miasto, with 15 religious, and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the Visitation (14 religious), the Perpetual Adoration (13 religious), and the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception (36 religious). The Sisters of Charity, 382 in number, have under their charge there 34 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or philanthropic institutions. In 1905 the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, five in number, had established themselves at <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>; but the Russian Government expelled them in 1910. There are remnants of the old orders that were suppressed in 1864, but their number is reduced from year to year.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15680b.htm">Diocese of Wladislaw</a> has the celebrated <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Czenstochowa, belonging to a congregation of cenobites called <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulists</a> (from <a href="../cathen/11590b.htm">St. Paul I</a> the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>). There are about forty religious, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. A grievous crime that was committed in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in 1909 led the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> authorities to adopt the severest measures for the re-establishment of religious discipline there. In the same diocese there are two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>, at Kolo and at <a href="../cathen/15680b.htm">Wladislaw</a>, with 10 religious; one <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Tertiaries, at Przyr&oacute;w, with 12 religious; and one <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Tertiaries, with 13 religious, at Wielun. There are 49 Sisters of Charity, who have charge of 13 philanthropic establishments. In the <a href="../cathen/12166b.htm">Diocese of Plock</a> there are: a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, at Obory, with 6 religious; a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06027b.htm">Felician Sisters</a>, at Przasnysz, with 9 religious; and 5 <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>, in the care of the Sisters of Charity.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/13688a.htm">Diocese of Sejny</a>, besides a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, with 10 religious, there are two <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and one asylum, under the care of 13 Sisters of Charity.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/13436b.htm">Diocese of Sandomir</a> there is a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, with 13 religious; and 6 charitable institutions, under the care of 29 Sisters of Charity.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08636a.htm">Diocese of Kielce</a> has 35 Sisters of Charity, and that of <a href="../cathen/09403a.htm">Lublin</a> 44, who are in charge of 8 charitable establishments.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/10428a.htm">Archdiocese of Mohileff</a> there are no <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, properly so called. At St. Petersburg and <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> there live some <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> of different nationalities, and it is by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of that order that the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of those two cities are served. In 1907 eight <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters, Missionaries of Mary, established themselves at St. Petersburg with the consent of the government. They direct a house of work. There are also in the archdiocese a few Sisters of French and of Polish congregations.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Diocese of Vilna</a> has a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>, with 6 religious, and a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, with 3 religious, at Slonim. In the Diocese of Kovno there is: a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, with 3 religious, at Kretinga; one <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Kovno, with 9 religious; and a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Sisters of St. Catharine, with 9 religious, at Kroki. At Zaslaff, in the <a href="../cathen/09463b.htm">Diocese of Lutzk, Zhitomir, and Kamenetz</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> have a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> with 4 resident religious; and there are about 10 religious of various other orders scattered throughout the diocese. There are no religious in the <a href="../cathen/14739a.htm">Diocese of Tiraspol</a>.

<p>In all, therefore, of the 13,000,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, 150 men and 550 <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are religious, and of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> 450 are Sisters of Charity. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, therefore, is deprived of an important part of its militia, and there is small hope that <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> will flourish in that country. The small <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> that remain depend on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and have, instead of <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincials</a>, visitors who are chosen from among the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. The several attempts of the Polish religious of Galicia (Augustinians, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, Bernardists, <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarists</a>, <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>) and others to establish themselves in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> since 1905 have been futile.
<h2 id="section6">Moral and intellectual life of the Catholic clergy in Russia</h2>

<p>From the moral and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> points of view, in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, as in all Orthodox countries, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> is very superior to that of other <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>, according to the confession even of the Orthodox writers themselves. Any shortcomings which may occur in the lives of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> arise out of circumstances beyond the control of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> cannot exercise in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> a more efficacious vigilance than it exercises in other countries; but even if it were in a position to do so, it would find an obstacle to its efforts in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the country. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> is too scattered, its work too great, and the civil offices imposed upon it by the bureaucracy too arduous. Nevertheless, in the difficult circumstances in which it is placed, its <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> has succeeded in working marvels, in holding its fold firmly bound to the Faith, and in conciliating the esteem of the Orthodox and the affection of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The generosity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, especially Poles and Lithuanians, is considerable, and therefore the financial circumstances of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are of the best, notwithstanding the fact that the stipends which it receives from the Russian Government are exceedingly small: <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> receive from 230 to 600 roubles a year, and canons have the same stipend. The people are very <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, and their <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> to the sanctuaries are frequent. At the Feast of the Assumption, the sanctuary of Czenstochowa is visited at times by as many as 1,000,000 <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. The sanctuary of Our Lady of Ostrabrama, at <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>, is also a centre of many <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>, and the streets that lead to it are always crowded with people on their knees.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> is unable to contribute efficiently to the propagation of the Faith, for its <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> is trammelled by very severe <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. In 1908-1911 many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were fined, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, and even exiled for having <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> children of <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>; nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> contributes in some measure to the work of the union. There had been hopes of restoring the Uniate Church in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> through the agency of three or four Russian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who were converted to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>; and two <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> Rite sprang up, at St. Petersburg and <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>. In 1911, however, the Russian Government closed the two <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and forbade the exercise of their ministry by the converted <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, one of whom returned to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in general, abstain from taking part in polities; but they do a great deal for the moral and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> development of their fellow-countrymen. The Poles are the staunchest supporters of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> and Polish nationalism in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. The Lithuanian <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> has taken a very active part in the awakening of Lithuanian nationalism, the restoration of the Lithuanian language to the churches of Lithuania, and the development of Lithuanian literature. From these points of view, therefore, both the Polish and Lithuanian <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> have rendered great service to their respective nationalities. It is to be regretted, however, that there should frequently arise at <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>, between the Polish and the Lithuanian <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, disputes that are at variance with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests. The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> development of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, as yet, is not all that might be desired. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, in all that concerns the admission of young men, are at the mercy of the government, which, possibly, prevents the more desirable youths from entering those establishments. For the rest, the course of studies in those <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> is not very complete. At present, however, an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral reform in these establishments is being sought: a considerable number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> go to foreign countries to complete their studies in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, and upon their return to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> teach in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press, also, which had been kept at a low standard by the Russian censorship, has improved greatly of recent times. In 1909 the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/15680b.htm">Wladislaw</a> began the publication of the "Duchowni Kaplan", a monthly periodical that is on a level with the most learned <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> publications of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Other <a href="../cathen/11669b.htm">Catholic periodicals</a> are published at <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>, <a href="../cathen/13436b.htm">Sandomir</a>, etc., and seek to neutralize the anti-Catholic propaganda, and the propaganda of <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheism</a>, which latter has its centre at <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, where it publishes its organ the "Mysl Nepolegla" (Independent Thought).

<p>The chief centre of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> study in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> is the Roman Catholic Ecclesiastical Academy of St. Petersburg, established in 1833, in place of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>, which was considered the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. The academy has a <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, an inspector, a <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a>, 15 professors, and a librarian. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> send to this establishment their best students, who after a course of four years receive the Degree of <a href="../cathen/01759a.htm">Master</a> of Theology. It has 60 students. Among its professors mention should be made of Mikhail Godlewski, author of important publications on the history of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>; and Stanislaus Trzeciak, the author of an important work on the literature and religion of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> at the time of Christ ("Literatura i religija u zyd&oacute;w za czas&oacute;w Chrystusa Pana", Warsaw, 1911).

<h2>The Orthodox Church of Russia</h2>

<p>Russian writers ordinarily divide the history of their national church into five periods. The first, from 989 to 1237, was the period of the diffusion of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was spread slowly, but the want of culture among the people caused <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a> to be maintained under the external appearances of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> rites. The conditions of the lower <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, both as to culture and to apostolic spirit, were wretched. Monastic life began to flourish in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Anton, coming from <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Mount Athos</a> in 1051, established himself in a grotto near Kieff, and collecting about him various followers, among them the famous Blessed Theodosius Petcherski, laid the foundation of the great <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> called Kievo-Petcherskaja. This <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> became a focus of culture in the development of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and is rightly considered a national monument of that country. Monasticism was so generally spread in the twelfth century that in the city of Kieff alone there were seventeen <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>.

<p>During this first period the Russian Church was totally dependent upon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople, and was governed by the Metropolitans of Kieff, the list of which opens with Leo (dead in 1004) and closes with the Metropolitan Josef in 1237. According to Golubinski this first list contains twenty-four names. Some of them, Mikhail, Ilarion, Ivan II, Ephraim, and Konstantin were placed upon the calendar of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. One of the most famous <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of this first epoch was St. Cyril of Turoff.

<p>The second period, from 1237, in which year begin the Mongolian invasions and the progressive development of the power of northern <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> extends to 1461, when Orthodox <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> was divided into two metropolitanates. During this period, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> was governed by the Metropolitans of all <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, the list of whom begins with Cyril III (1242-49), and closes with St. Gona (1448-61). Among these <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, St. Pioter (1308-26), St. Alexei (1354-78), and St. Gona (1448-61) were raised to the honours of the altar of the Russian Church. The latter fought against the Tatars; while several Russian princes suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> for their Faith and were <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>. Some few missionaries attempted to spread <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> among the Tatars. In 1329 two Russian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, Sergei and Germanus, founded the famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a>, on an islet of Lake Ladoga. In the second half of the fourteenth century St. Stephen, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Perm (died 1396), preached <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> to the Zyriani. The efforts of the Russians, however, to win Lithuania over to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> were not <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with success. During this period, there were eighteen eparchies in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. The Russian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> gradually leaned towards <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, which had aspirations to spiritual supremacy. The moral and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> conditions of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were very low. Towards the latter end of the fourteenth century, there arose the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <em>Strigolniki</em>, who rejected the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. Monasticism attained its highest development, there appearing 180 new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. St. Sergei Radonejski (dead in 1392), a saint whom popular legends represent as endowed with <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> powers, became the legislator of the new monasticism. At Sergievo, 40 miles from <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, he founded the celebrated <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Most Holy Trinity</a>, a great religious and national monument of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at this epoch contained possibly 300 religious.

<p>The third period is from 1461 to 1589, when the Russian Church was divided into the two metropolitanates of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> and Kieff. The former was bounded by the frontiers of Great <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and was strictly Russian and Orthodox. That of Kieff attempted to assimilate the culture of the West, and developed great literary activity. In the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, Tihon of Vyatka (dead in 1612) worked for the conversion of the Voguli and of the Ostiaki of the Government of Perm. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Solovka evangelized the Lopari, in which efforts the Blessed Theodoretus (dead in 1577) and the Blessed Tihon Petchengski (1495-1583) distinguished themselves. In the work of the conversion to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> of the Tatars of Kazan, the <em>higumeno</em> George (Gurij) Rugotin became famous. He died 4 Dec., 1563, and was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by the Russian Church; so also was the <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrite</a> Barsonofius (dead in 1576, and Germanus (died 1567). Other Russian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> devoted their energies to the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> of Astrakhan and of the Caucasus.

<p>The Russian Church became more and more separated from the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, and towards the end of the fifteenth century refused to receive Greek <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Among the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> of this time, Macarius (1542-63), and the energetic Philippus II, who was slain by order of Ivan the Terrible in 1473, were distinguished by the extent of their learning. In the Metropolitanate of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> there were ten eparchates. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> was very numerous, and many of its members, unable to subsist in the villages, lived a vagabond life at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, to the detriment of discipline. With a view to reforming the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> there was convened at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> in 1551 the famous Council of the Hundred Chapters (<em>Stoglav</em>). Monasticism spread more and more. From the fifteenth to the seventeenth century there appeared three hundred new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, which accumulated enormous wealth. The Blessed Nil Sorski (1433-1508) made himself the champion of a reform among the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, which implied on their part the renunciation of all real <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and seclusion in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. His doctrines found numerous adversaries, among whom was the Blessed Josef of Volock (1440-1515). Many <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and ascetics of this time were <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Among the more famous of these, were Alexander Svirski (dead in 1533) and Daniel of Pereiaslaff (died 1540). The want of religious instruction favoured <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> and the germination of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. In the fifteenth century there broke out, at Novgorod and its surroundings, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaizers</a> (<em>zhidovstvujushshie</em>), against which the Archbishop Gennadius (a saint who died in 1505) and the Blessed Josef of Volock struggled with much energy. In the sixteenth century Matwei Baksin and Theodosius Kosoi taught <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalist</a> doctrines, <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjuring</a> the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> government, which evoked refutations and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathemas</a> from Maxim the Greek, and from the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Zinovii Otenski. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> established themselves at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>.

<p>There were fifteen <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> of Kieff, from Gregor the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> (1458-73), who, according to Golubinski, after embracing the union, returned to the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, to Onisiphorus Dievotchak (1579-89), who was succeeded by Mikhail Ragosa &mdash; the latter having embraced the Union. The Orthodox of the metropolitanate, after the Union of Brest, fanatically opposed the progress of the Unionists. Russian writers mention with praise, among these champions of Orthodoxy against the Union, Prince Andrei Kurbski and Prince Konstantin of Ostrog. The followers of Orthodoxy also established confraternities for the printing and dissemination of polemical works, and to oppose <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> influence through the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. For want of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of their own, members of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> passed over to the Union. In 1620, however, Theophanus, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Job Borecki <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Kieff, and six members of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> respectively of Polotsk, Vladimir, <a href="../cathen/09463b.htm">Lutzk</a>, Przemysl, <a href="../cathen/03645d.htm">Chelm</a>, and Pinsk; and thus the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was reestablished. In the domain of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were prolific of works, written by Orthodox <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, to combat the arguments of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and Uniates. The most salient <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> of the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of Kieff during this period was the Metropolitan Peter Moghila (died 1646).

<p>The fourth period of the Russian Church is that of the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> (1589-1700). The Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> was created in 1589 by Jeremias II, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople. The first patriarch was Job (1589-1605); he was succeeded by Ignatei (1605-06), Hermogenes (1606-11), Filarete Romanoff (1619-33), Joshaphat (1634-40), Josef (1642-52), <a href="../cathen/11077b.htm">Nikon</a> (1652-66), Joshaphat (1667-72), Pitirim (1672-73), Joachim Saveloff (1674-90), and Adrian (1690-1700). Among the most famous of these mention should be made of Filarete and Joachim, bitter enemies of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>; and of <a href="../cathen/11077b.htm">Nikon</a>, who with uncurbed energy upheld the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of his Church against the usurpations of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>, on which account he was deposed in 1666. The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> formed at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> a court, which, especially under Filarete Romanoff, was a rival of that of the tsars, both as to wealth and authority, and which for these reasons was suppressed by the tsars. The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> exercised superintendence over the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and over the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the number of whom was increased and diminished by turns. After the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, Novgorod, Kazan, Rostoff, and Kruticki became metropolitanates, and Suzdal, Ryazan, Tver, Vologda, and Smolensk were made <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal sees</a>. The number of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> was fixed at eight. In 1620 Siberia was given an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> at Tobolsk. In 1682 the Tsar Feodor Alexeievitch proposed the establishment of 12 metropolitanates and 72 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>; but a council of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> reduced the latter number to 34, later to 22, and thereafter to 14. There was a lack of funds for the support of the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and at the end of the seventeenth century the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> had 13 metropolitanates, 7 archbishoprics, and 2 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>.

<p>Meanwhile the tsars, seeing the growth of the influence and power of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> under the rule of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, adopted the policy of diminishing the prerogatives of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The Tsar Alexis Mikhailovitch published a statute (<em>ulozhenie</em>) which prohibited the further acquisition of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The judicial position of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> received another blow by the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the so-called <em>monastyrskij prikaz</em> (monasterial ordinance). The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> received this <em>diminutio capitis</em> with evident displeasure; and when <a href="../cathen/11077b.htm">Nikon</a>, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Novgorod, was raised to the patriarchal dignity in 1652, protests were redoubled, and the conflict between the patriarch and the tsar became acute. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who were partisans of the tsar, had the support of the Greek <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. The Council of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, to please the tsar, deposed the patriarch, who died after a long captivity, at Bielo-ozero, in 1681. With the death of <a href="../cathen/11077b.htm">Nikon</a> the Russian Church was yoked to the chariot of the State. Peter the Great found that the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> was useless, and in fact an obstacle in the way of the realization of his purposes; and accordingly, at the death of Adrian in 1700, he suppressed it. The Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> had succeeded in unifying the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. After the convention of 1686 between <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, which made the tsars of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> masters of Kieff and Little <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, the Patriarch Joachim named Gedeon Tchetvertinski <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of Kieff, and in 1687 Dionysius, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, recognized the dependency of the Metropolitanate of Kieff upon the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>.

<p>In the seventeenth century under the <a href="../cathen/11077b.htm">Patriarch Nikon</a> a great <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> broke out in the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, called the Schism of the Old Believers. The <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> in use in the Russian Church were replete with <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. Their correction was an urgent necessity, and had been undertaken in the sixteenth century. The fanatics opposed this "corruption" of the sacred texts, and Maxim the Greek, who had worked upon it, paid for his participation in the work with a long <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. Under <a href="../cathen/11077b.htm">Nikon</a> in 1654 a council held at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> recognized the necessity of the reform in question. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> were corrected, but many Russians, influenced by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, refused to accept the corrected versions. It began to be rumoured that <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, personified by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, had in view the destruction of the Orthodox Russian Church, through the Latin <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of western <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. But a council held at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> in 1666 approved the reform of <a href="../cathen/11077b.htm">Nikon</a>, and pronounced its <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> against those who had not accepted his decisions. <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">Anathemas</a>, were however, like the severity of the government, without effect against these deserters from the official Church. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who were averse to the reform withdrew to solitary places, and founded clandestine <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, among which those of Vyg, Starodub, and Vyatka became famous. The more violent schismatics were burnt alive or decapitated. But persecutions invigorated the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, called in Russian <em>raskio</em>, whence the name of its adherents, <em><a href="../cathen/12648b.htm">Raskolniki</a></em>.

<p>The fifth, called the synodal, period begins with 1700, and extends to the present time. At the death of Adrian (1700), Stepan Tavorski, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Ryazan, and a learned <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, was appointed patriarchal vicar, and charged to reform the entire constitution of the Russian Church. Tavorski found an excellent co-operator in Theophanus Prokopovitch, who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Pskof in 1718, and who, although <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and according to some, a convert to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, nourished a bitter <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Peter the Great gave to Prokopovitch the task of preparing the "Ecclesiastical Regulations" which became the Magna Carta of the Russian Church. This code was finished in 1720. It is divided into three parts, concerning respectively the functions of the synod, the matters put under its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of its members. The synod was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> opened on 14 Feb., 1721. By the "Ecclesiastical Regulations", the tsar is the supreme judge of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> college. His representative in that capacity was a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, who in a document of 1722 is called the eye of the tsar. This functionary, bearing the title of <em>Ober-Prokuror</em>, was to be chosen preferably from the military class.

<p>The synod in the early period of its existence had ten members, besides the president, and maintained its <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> character. After the death of Peter the Great, however, that <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> character was lost by degrees, and the synod became a vast political bureaucracy. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were at the mercy of the procurators-general, who at times, as in the case of Prince Sharkhovski, regarded the synod as a political institution, and sometimes maltreated the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who formed that body. There were procurators-general who made public profession of <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheism</a>, as Tchebysheff (1768-74), or of <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a>, as Prince A. Golycin (1803). The Russian Church suffered humiliation under the lay rule of the synod (see the important work of Blagovidoff, an ex-professor of the Ecclesiastical Academy of Kazan, on "The Procurators of the Holy Synod"). In 1881 there was called to the government of the synod Konstantin Pobiedonostseff, a man of great culture but of reactionary <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, who wished to unite all the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> professed in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>. The epoch of Pobiedonostseff was one of complete thraldom for the Russian Church. His dictatorship however came to an end in 1905, when the edict of toleration was <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>. The Liberal Russian <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> attacked the synod and the anti-canonical constitution of the Russian Church in the Press, and demanded the reestablishment of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. The Government proposed the convocation of a great <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national synod</a>, to return its liberties to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and to give it a new constitution, but this purpose was frustrated by the friction between the "white" (secular) and the "black" (regular) <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, by the triumph of the revolutionary parties, and by the outbreak of the revolution. The synod continued to exercise its deleterious authority under various procurators: Prince Obolenski, Izvolski, Lukianoff (a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> specialist), and finally, in 1911, Carolus Viadimirovitch Sabler, a former associate of Pobiedonostseff, but a man of broader and more liberal <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>.

<p>Other changes were made in the eparchies. When the synod was established, there were 18 eparchies and 2 vicariates in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>; in 1764, the number of the former had increased to 29, and to 36 at the beginning of the nineteenth century; which latter number was increased under Nicholas I, and became 65 in our day. The eparchies are ruled by <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> (St. Petersburg, <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, and Kieff), <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. According to the most recent statistics, there were 133 Russian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, including the bishop-vicars of the eparchies, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> without a charge. In regard to the moral character of the Russian episcopate, and concerning the various institutions of the Russian <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, see the present writer's work "La Chiesa russa", pp. 105-160. The Russian <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, which is divided into two castes, the "white" <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, or seculars, and the "black" <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, or regulars, has not acquired, among the Russians, the moral prestige that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> has acquired in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries. According to the latest statistics, there are in the "white" <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> 45,000 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 2400 archpriests, 15,000 <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and 44,000 singers, while there are 60,000 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> in the country. This <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> exercises its ministry over more than 90 millions of Orthodox faithful; but it is rendered incapable of accomplishing its mission by poverty, want of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, the lack of sound vocations, the oppression of the Government, contempt and social isolation, <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> cares, and not infrequently by drink. Only in the cities are there to be found <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of culture and in comfortable circumstances; those who work in the rural <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> are deserving of pity and compassion.

<p>In the eighteenth century, the "black" <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> suffered vicissitudes that greatly reduced the number of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. Peter the Great especially and Anna Ivanovna treated the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> with the greatest severity. Nevertheless the "black" <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> preserved the moral and <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> superiority in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>; <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, rectors, and inspectors of academies and <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> are taken from the ranks of the "black" <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> still possess immense riches. According to the most recent statistics there are 298 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> that are recognized and subsidized by the Government, while there are 154 not subsidized (<em>zastatnij</em>). There were 9317 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and 8266 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>. There were 400 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, inhabited by 12,652 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> and 40,275 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>. Many of these <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> are of the Russian Sisters of Charity, who maintain 184 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and 148 asylums. The life of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, except in a few <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of strict observance, is very lax.

<p>The Orthodox <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> receives its <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, preparatory for the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> (<em>dukhovnyja utchilishsha</em>) of which there are 185, with 1302 instructors, and which are maintained at an expense to the state of 6,153,353 roubles yearly; in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminaries</a>, of which there are 57, with 866 instructors and 20,500 students; and also in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> academies of St. Petersburg, <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, Kieff, and Kazan, in which there are 120 instructors and 862 students; these academies possess very valuable <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>, and have professors of great scientific merit. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> both morally or intellectually are in a wretched condition; from these <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> the moral and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> shortcomings of the Russian <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are derived, their students, as a rule, entering the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> without the least vocation. In 1906-08 these institutions became hotbeds of revolutionists, and even of anarchists. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> are cultivated in the academies, which publish periodicals of great merit as the "Khristianskoe Tchtenie" (Christian Reading) at St. Petersburg; the "Bogoslovski Viestnik" (Theological Messenger) at Sergievsk Posad; the "Trudy" (Works) of the Ecclesiastical Academy of Kieff, and the "Pravoslavnyi Sobesiednik" at Kazan. Other important periodicals are the "Strannik" (St. Petersburg Traveller), the "Tcherkovnij Viestnik" (Ecclesiastical Messenger), the "Cerkovnija Viedomosti" (Ecclesiastical News), the organ of the synod at St. Petersburg; "Dushepoleznoe Tchtenie" (Edifying Reading), at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, and the "Khristianin" (The Christian), at Sergievsk Posad. Among the most famous professors of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> academies of the present day, mention should be made of the great <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegete</a> Nikolai Glubokovski, the canonists Zaozerski and Berdnikoff, the historian Znamenski, etc. The most famous of them all, at present, is the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> Malinovski. A comprehensive study on the Russian <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> and academies may be found in the work "La Chiesa russa", pp. 541-679.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educating</a> influence of the Russian <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> upon the people is very slight. On the other hand the bureaucracy would suppress any effort of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to give to the people a higher sense of its <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> maintains a great many elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, the number of which was much increased in the time of Pobiedonostseff. These establishments are divided into <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of two classes, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of one class; of the former there are 672, with 77,000 students of both sexes; while there are 25,425 one-class <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with 1,400,000 students of both sexes; and in addition 13,650 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in which reading is taught, with 436,000 pupils. There are 426 secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with 22,300 students, the yearly maintenance of which costs a sum of 17,000,000 roubles.

<p>The apostolic work of the Russian <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> has small result. The internal missions are against the <a href="../cathen/12648b.htm">Raskolniki</a>, the mystic and the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalist</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The missionaries direct their efforts towards the conversion of dissidents to Orthodoxy rather by the assistance of the police and by human means than by a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> spirit and by convincing arguments. All efforts, not excluding deportation to <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a>, have failed to secure the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/12648b.htm">Raskolniki</a>, who since 1905 have enjoyed a certain liberty, and at the present time maintain a great propaganda. Their number is estimated at 15,000,000. Among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> the Russian missions are without effect; in fact since 1905 many of the Orthodox have embraced <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> or <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>. For three centuries Russian missionaries have worked for the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> Tatars; but the trivial nature of the propaganda among that people was shown in 1905, when 500,000 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Tatars returned to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>.

<p>The foreign missions of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> are in North and South America, <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, Corea, and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. In North America the efforts of the Orthodox missionaries are directed to the conversion of the Uniate <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> who <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrate</a> to that continent. In other countries their efforts are almost without result, with the exception of <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, where Ivan Kasatkin, who is now an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, and who went to those islands in 1860, succeeded in establishing a <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> branch of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, Which numbers about 30,000 adherents and about 40 native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (cf. "La Chiesa russa", pp. 397-539).

<p>The Church of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> is the support and strength of Orthodoxy, which, counting Russians, Greeks, and Rumanians, has more than 110 millions of adherents. The conversion of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, therefore, would end the Eastern Schism. But the hour of a reconciliation between the East and the West is yet far distant, however much desired by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and also by Russians, such as Vladimir Soloveff. There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that among the cultured classes of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> there are to be found <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who desire this union, and who readily recognize the defects of their national Church; but there is no movement towards union with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. As a rule, the cultured classes of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> are contaminated with the poison of infidelity; while the lower classes are slaves of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> or <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and most attached to the formalities of their rite. They are the easy prey of the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalist</a> or mystic Russian <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. Possibly <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> would have been <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> if, after the Union of Brest, politics and human passions had not rendered the condition of the Uniates most unhappy, and placed obstacles in the way of the development of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. But it is useless to lament the past; and every effort should be made that the latent religious forces of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> may some day find their full development in union with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> under a single shepherd.
