<h1>The Renaissance</h1>  

<p>The Renaissance may be considered in a general or a particular sense, as (1) the achievements of what is termed the modern spirit in opposition to the spirit which prevailed during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>; or (2) the revival of classic, especially of Greek, learning and the recovery of ancient art in the departments of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, and architecture, lost for a thousand years in <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Christendom</a>.

<p>Impossible though it be to separate these elements from the whole movement into which they enter, we may distinguish them from it for our present purpose, viz., to sum up the influences, whether <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which are traceable to the antique, pre-Christian, or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> world of letters and plastic remains, as it came to be known and studied from the end of the fourteenth century onwards, in relation to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> goes through periods analogous to the changes brought about by secular revolutions. Roughly speaking, the age of the Fathers corresponds to the Imperial Roman period, closing in A.D. 476; the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> occupy those tumultuous years when barbarians turned <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were learning slowly to be civilized, from 476 to 1400; while the modern relations of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> begin with the definite emergence of nationalities in the West, at an era most critical, signalized by the destruction of the Greek Empire, the invention of printing from movable type, the discovery of America, and all this leading on to the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant Reformation</a>. History, like life, is a continuous web; its various stages pass into one another by the finest degrees. But after the Great Schism was healed by the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> in 1417, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, turning her back once for all on a worn-out <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudalism</a>, and no longer engaged in strife with Teuton emperors, found herself in the presence of new difficulties, and the character of the times was manifestly altered.

<p>We are dwelling now in this modern epoch. The <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> have become an interlude, clearly bounded on both extremities by a more civilized or humane <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of life, which men are endeavouring to realize in politics, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, manners and literature, and religion. This blending of widely dissevered ages and peoples by virtue of a complex type into a consistent, though greatly enlarged historical system, has been due to the Renaissance, taken as a whole. A glance at the map will remind us of the striking fact that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is bound up in space no less than in time with the Greek and Roman World. It has never yet flourished extensively outside these borders, except in so far as it subdued to ancient culture the tribes to which it offered the Gospel. There is a mysterious and providential link, recognized in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, St. John, and St. Peter, between <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as the head of secular dominion and the visible Kingdom of Christ. <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> protected as well as <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the disciples; Greek philosophy lent its terms to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. The School of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, taught by Clement and <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, did not scruple to quote Athenian literature in illustration of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>. <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a> wrote Greek poems in a style which was moulded on the classic tragedians. There was always in the West a <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritan</a> spirit, of which from <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> down to the Spanish Priscillian we may note examples; but the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who established our <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a>&mdash;<a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, Augustine, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>&mdash;held more tolerant views; and though <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> felt compunctious visitings for the days and nights he had given to Plautus or Cicero, his own diction is severely classic. His <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Latin Vulgate</a>, also, while it obeys the construction of the Hebrew, is written in cultivated, not in rustic, language. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, the Great despised grammar as a subordinate accomplishment, but was himself a good scholar.

<p>The loss of Greek authors and the decline of Church Latin into barbarism were misfortunes in a universal ruin; neither of these events was the consequences of a deliberate break with antiquity. Latin and Greek had become sacred languages; the Western and Eastern <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> carried them with <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> wherever they went. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was Latin by tradition and by choice. No German dialect ever attained to the privileges of the sanctuary which St. Cyril won for the Old <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> from <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Pope Nicholas I</a>. Under these circumstances, a revival of learning, so soon as the West was capable of it, might have been foreseen. And it was equally to be anticipated that the Vatican would not reject a movement of reconciliation, akin to that whereby so many of the ancient usages had been long ago adapted to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ends. Speaking of the second century, Walter Pater observes: "What has been on the whole the method of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as a 'power of sweetness and patience', in dealing with matters like <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> art, <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> literature, was even then manifest." There had been, at that day, an "earlier and unimpeachable Renaissance". The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principle, in accordance with its name, assimilates, purifies, consecrates, all that is not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, provided that it will submit to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. And the central classic authors, on whose study liberal <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> has been set up from the age of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> among Greeks, from the Augustan era in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, were happily amenable to the cleansing <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. As a literature, the chief schoolbooks were singularly free from moral deformities; their teaching fell short of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>; but it was often heroic, and its perils admitted of correction. <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> happily describes Graeco-Roman civilization as "the soil in which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> grew up". And Pater concludes that "it was by the bishops of Rome. . .that the path of what we must call humanism was thus defined", as the ideal, namely, of a perfect training in wisdom and beauty. Quite in unison with such a temper of mind, <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Pope Leo X</a> in 1515 wrote to Beroaldo, the editor of Tacitus: "Nothing more excellent or useful has been given to men by the Creator, it we except the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and worship of Himself, than these studies".



<p>When, therefore, <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> (1447-55) founded the Vatican Library, his act was inspired by the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, deservedly known as the nursing-mother of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, in which the seven "liberal arts" had always been taught. <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, the greatest of them, had received formal recognition in 1211 from <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>. Between the years 1400 and 1506 we may reckon some twenty-eight charters granted by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> to as many <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, from St. Andrews to Alcal&aacute; and from Caen and <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> to <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> and Frankfort-on-the-Oder. But <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> was propagated chiefly from Italian centres and by Italian or Greek professors. We must bear in mind a fact which is often lost sight of, that the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a> had never taken deep root in the Peninsula, and that its masters chiefly flourished north of the Alps. <a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a>, <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>, Middleton, Occam, were Britons; <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albert the Great</a> was a German; <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, his disciple, taught at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. On the other hand, that renaissance of <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman Law</a> which enabled <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a> and his successors to withstand the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, began with <a href="../cathen/08168a.htm">Irnerius</a> at Bologna. Again, it was <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a> (1303-1374) who inaugurated the far-reaching movement which claimed for literature, i.e., for poetry, rhetoric, history, and all their branches, the rank hitherto maintained by <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> and philosophy; <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>, who crystallizes the <a href="../summa/index.html">"Summa"</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> in <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> verse, remains <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a>; <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a> is modern precisely by this difference, although we must not fancy him opposed to Church or Bible. Now when Greek <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> were eagerly sought after, and when Cicero dictated the canons of Latin style, the syllogism with its arena of disputation could not be give place to the orator's chair and the secretary's desk. Not <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> but life was the end of study. We remark no considerable achievement in <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> until the culminating period, both of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, had passed away.

<p>In 1455, the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Pope Nicholas</a> contained 824 Latin and 352 Greek <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. In 1484, at the death of <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>, the Greek <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, had increased to one thousand. From the catalogues we infer that much interest was taken in collecting the great Fathers, the canon law, and <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas</a> owned the famous <a href="../cathen/04086a.htm">Vatican Codex (B)</a> of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>; <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus</a> has in his possession fifty-eight bibles or parts of bibles. <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Cardinal Bessarion</a> gave his magnificent stock of books to St. Mark's <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>; and the Medicean Library, collected at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, where it still reposes (the Laurentian), was for a while transferred to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>. At Basle the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, <a href="../cathen/08476a.htm">John of Ragusa</a>, left important Greek <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, of parts of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, which were used by Reuchlin and <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> with advantage. These illustrations may suffice to indicate the movement, becoming universal throughout <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, towards recovery from all sides of the treasures of the past. Another and most important step was to print that which had been so recovered. Printing was a German invention. The local ordinaries and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> favoured it greatly. Cloisters became the home of the Press; among them we may quote Marienthal (1468), St. Ulrich, at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> (1472), the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> at <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> (1474). Typography was introduced at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> in 1474 by the <a href="../cathen/04166b.htm">Brothers of the Common Life</a>. They called themselves "preachers in not in word but in type". And the early printed books in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> were of a popular devotional, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a>, and Biblical character.

<p>To the Renaissance in its opening stage the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> belongs of scattering broadcast the printed <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Latin Vulgate</a> as well as translations of it in most <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> languages, of course with approval from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Ninety-eight complete editions of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> were sent our before 1500; a dozen editions preceded the appearance in type of and Latin classic. The first book produced by <a href="../cathen/07090a.htm">Gutenberg</a> was that exceedingly beautiful "42-line" Bible according to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> version afterwards known as the Mazarine Bible and still extant in several copies. The first dated Bible came out at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> in 1462; the first <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a>, in 1475, was followed by twenty-one editions. The Hebrew test was printed at Soncino and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> between 1477 and 1486; the Rabbinic Bible was dedicated at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> to <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> in 1517. Cardinal Ximenes renewed the labours of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> by his Polyglot of Aleala, 1514-22, which included the Greek <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> anticipated its publication by an indifferent text in 1516. Aldus printed the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> in 1518. As regards translations on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> side, they went on before and after <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, from the Spanish of Boniface Ferrer in 1405 to the English of <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douai</a> in 1609. All these were printed; but space will not all more than a reference to the details here, or to the changes in policy brought about, in consequence of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> translations and the abuse of Scripture-reading, under <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. During the period commonly assigned to the Renaissance at its height (1453-1527), freedom was the rule. <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> had it in mind to make <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> centre of the world. His successors entered largely into the same <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> (Piccolomini) was a man of letters, not unlike the great <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a>. <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a>, though severe upon neopagans, such as Pomponazzo, did not condemn the Classical movement. <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> was a statesman, not a scholar and not an Italian. The fierce and splendid <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>, himself without culture, gave commissions to <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> and <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>, but openly despised the pedants about his court. From <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> his age receives its title&mdash;he was the "incarnation of the Renaissance in its most brilliant form".

<p>An extraordinary enthusiasm for antiquity had set in, combined with boundless freedom of opinion, with a laxity of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> which has ever since given <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> to believers and unbelievers alike, and with a festal magnificence recalling the days and nights of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero's</a> "golden house". The half-century which ends in the sack of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> soldiers, however dazzling from a scenic point of view, cannot be dwelt on with satisfaction by any <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, even when we have discounted the enormous falsehoods long current in historians who accepted satires and party statements at their own value. Churchmen in high places were constantly unmindful of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, purity, self-denial; many had lost all sense of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ideals; not a few were deeply stained by <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> vices. The temper of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> like <a href="../cathen/02425e.htm">Bembo</a> and Bibbiena, shown forth in the comedies of this latter <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> as they were acted before the Roman Court and imitated far and wide, is to us not less incomprehensible than disedifying. The earlier years of &AElig;neas Sylvius, the whole career of Rodrigo Borgia, the life of Farnese, himself as well as the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>, these all exhibit the union of subtlety, vigour, and other worldly qualities, which leaves us in dumb and sorrowful amazement. <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> fought and intrigued like a mere secular prince; <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, although certainly not an unbeliever, was frivolous in the extreme; <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> drew on himself the contempt as well as the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of all who had dealings with him, by his crooked ways and cowardly subterfuges which led to the taking and pillage of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>Now, it is not unfair to trace in these <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, as to their advisers, a certain common type, the pattern of which was Cesare Borgia, sometime <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, but always in mind and action a condottiere, while its <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> was <a href="../cathen/09501a.htm">Machiavelli</a>. We may express it in the words of Villari as a "prodigious <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> activity accompanied by moral decay". The passion for ancient literature, quickened and illustrated when the buried classic marbles were brought to light, simply intoxicated that generation. Not only did they fall away from monastic severities, they lost all decent and manly self-control. The survivors of a less corrupt age, as <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a> in his sonnets, remind us that native Italian genius had done great things before this new spirit took possession of it. But there is no denying that in its triumphant days the Renaissance looked up to beauty, and looked away from <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, as the standard and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of life. It had neither eyes nor sense for the beauty of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. When it is called "pagan" we mean this corrupting anarchic influence, represented more gracefully by genuine poets and men of letters like Politian, more grossly by such licentious singers as Lorenzo de' Medici, by Poggio, <a href="../cathen/02246c.htm">Bandello</a>, Aretino, and a thousand others who declared that the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> of Petronius Arbiter were good enough for them. When <a href="../cathen/13490a.htm">Savonarola</a> in 1475 fled to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, and there composed his lament on "the ruin of the Church", he cried out: "The temple is fallen, and the house of chastity". But the earthquake had not yet come. Worse things were to happen than he had seen. And a catastrophe was inevitable, of which he would be the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in St. Mark's, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, sent to a partly credulous and a still more exasperated world.

<p><a href="../cathen/13490a.htm">Savonarola</a> (1453-98), <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> (1466-1536), and <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">Sir Thomas More</a> (1478-1535) may be taken as figures in what has been sometimes called the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Renaissance. They represent beyond question the mind of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> concerning those ancient authors, not sacrificing <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to scholarship, or <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> to Homer and Horace, while they allow to culture its province and its privileges. Such was to be the lasting concordat between divinity and the humanities, but not until <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> had robbed <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> of its independence, after the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> had set their house in order, and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> had been entrusted with the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth. On the strength of his protest against the unseemly and degrading literature which abounded in his time, <a href="../cathen/13490a.htm">Savonarola</a> was condemned as a <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritan</a>; his "burning of the vanities" in 1497 has been cited in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>; and he employed scathing language (see the Letter to Verino, 1497) that may be strained to this conclusion. But among his penitents were artists, poets, and learned men: Pico della Mirandola, <a href="../cathen/02318a.htm">Fra Bartolommeo</a>, <a href="../cathen/02708b.htm">Botticelli</a>, <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>. The friar himself bought for St. Mark's at a heavy charge the famous Medicean Library; and every candid reader will perceive in his denunciation of current books and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> an honest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian's</a> outcry against cancerous vices which were sapping the life of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. When we come to <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a>, no fanatic assuredly, we discover that he too made a difference between <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">clean and unclean</a>. <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> laughed to scorn the Ciceronian pedantries of <a href="../cathen/02425e.htm">Bembo</a> and <a href="../cathen/13324a.htm">Sadoleto</a>; he quoted with disgust the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganizing</a> terms in which some Roman preachers travestied the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and scenes of the Gospels. He had a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the inspired Word, and his Greek and Latin <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> was the chief literary event of the year that saw its publication. He edited <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> with minute care (1516); he did something for the chief <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, and not a little for the Greek. In his preface to St. Hilary his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> scholar commends all learning, old or new, but he would have its proper value given to each department from the Scriptures even to the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a>. His "Praise of Folly" and other satirical writings were an attack, not upon <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> genius, but upon the self-confident <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> which declaimed against good literature without knowing what it meant. So rare and indefatigable an appraiser of literary works in every form could not be insensible to the merits of St. Augustine, however much he delighted in Virgil. The scholarship of <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a>, given to the world in a lively Latin, was universal and often profound. It was also honestly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; to make <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> known and understood was the supreme purpose he kept in view. And thus the "prince of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanists</a>" could remain <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, while looking for a moral restoration, during the whirlwind of <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Luther's revolt</a>. In him the Renaissance had cast away its <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>.

<p>His friend, <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">Sir Thomas More</a>, a liberal scholar, a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the enchanting courtesy of his daily converse and by the simple, almost ironical heroism which he displayed on the scaffold, how antique learning and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> virtue might combine in the loftiest of ideals. <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">More's</a> "Utopia" won a place by itself, which it still keeps, far above the imitative and passing literature of those Latin versifiers, those vain rhetoricians, who at best were scholiasts, but too commonly wasted their small talents in feebly reproducing the classic themes and metres. The English chancellor took a firm grip of social and religious problems, not so much regarding theory as intent on reform according to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principles. He wrote Latin with greater force than elegance; his works in the vernacular have salt and savour, wit and idiom to commend their <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. In the same category of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanists</a> we may associate with <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">More</a> a goodly number of <a href="../cathen/05431b.htm">Englishmen</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, Hadley and Selling, who were students at Padua in 1464, to Crocyn, Linacre, Colet, Fox, and the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> <a href="../cathen/08462b.htm">Cardinal Fisher</a>.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the first stages of revived learning had been free from Italian dissoluteness and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> doctrines. <a href="../cathen/11060b.htm">Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa</a> reformed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, while promoting philosophy by his own speculations and collecting <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. <a href="../cathen/01231b.htm">Rudolf Agricola</a> (1443-85) united the study of the ancients with devotion to <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>; von Langen, consummate Latinist, remodelled the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>; he was <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> at Deventer. The illustrious <a href="../cathen/15649a.htm">Wimpheling</a>, born in 1450, taught <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in principle and practice on <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> lines. He was Reuchlin's master, a genuine scholar, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> against the newly-imported unchristian ways of the so-called "poets"; and when <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> rose up, <a href="../cathen/15649a.htm">Wimpheling</a> opposed him as he had opposed the encroachments of <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman Law</a>. With Reuchlin we are plunged into debate and controversy; but he, too, was sincerely religious, and in 1516 he triumphed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> over his adversaries, gaining thereby a victory for Hebrew erudition, which in other ways the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> had taken into favour. Many Humanists, by and by, made common cause with the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>; <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>, <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, were eminently learned. But the Renaissance never was absorbed into any <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> movement; reforming <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> scattered <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>, emptied <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, and too often threw back <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, until its first fury was spent. The spirit of which <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritanism</a> is a complete expression had no affinity with Classic literature; at its touch the world of art, of dramatic poetry, of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, sacred or secular, of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> in life and outside of schoolbooks, fell into dust. Heine (Ueber Deutschland) saw that the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was, in effect, a Teutonic answer to the Renaissance; and we now perceive that, while the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> have lost their hold upon men's hearts, the revival of letters is broadening out into a transformation of democracy by means of culture: hic labor, hoc opus; the question of how to reconcile a perfectly-equipped <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> with an ascetic religion and the demands of freedom for all, is one which non of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> contemplated, much less did they succeed in resolving it.

<p>Among <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a>, to whom we owe the word <em>renaissance</em>, that problem was not mooted at first. The Italian, Aleandro, coming to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1508, gave lectures in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. He was made <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. Aleandro became a strenuous opponent of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>; and the Sorbonne is charged by Mark Pattison with persecuting the great printer, Robert Estienne (1503-59), though he always obtained license to sell his bibles and testaments. The Sorbonne objected, however, to any publication of Scripture without approved <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> notes; and this in a day which might be justly termed on of rebuke and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> had its own type of Humanist in that extraordinary man, Rabelais (1490-1553), a physician, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and obscene jester whose book is the glory and the shame of his native tongue. Rabelais, treating the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> as a creed outworn, falls back upon a kind of liberal <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonism</a>; he would leave men to their <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instincts</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of life. Much the same philosophy, though in graver tones, is insinuated by Montaigne (1533-92) in essays tinged with scepticism and disenchantment. These two writers, who lie beyond the spring-tide of the revival, open in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the anti-Christian <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which has lasted, with growing <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, down to our time. But the seventeenth century witnessed an adaptation of the classical forms to literature and preaching by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of genius, by <a href="../cathen/11511a.htm">Pascal</a>, <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, <a href="../cathen/12630b.htm">Racine</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a>, which yielded a highly original blending of religion with eloquent prose and refined verse. In general, nevertheless, we shall probably allow Taine's convention that the influence of the Classics (Latin rather than Greek always) on <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> has not been favourable to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.

<p>At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and "incredible Liberty" of discussion prevailed under the spell of the Renaissance. Lord Acton quotes well-known instances. Poggio, the mocking adversary of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, was for half a century in the service of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> &mdash; Filelfo, a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> unabashed and foul, was handsomely rewarded by <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> for his abominable satires. <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> had the faults of a smart <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> journalist, and took neither himself nor his age seriously. Platina, with whom <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a> quarreled on political grounds, wrote a vindictive <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderous</a> book, "The Lives of the Roman Pontiffs", which, however, was in some degree justified by the project of reformation in "head and members" constantly put forth and never fulfilled until <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> had been rent in twain. Yet <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> made Platina librarian of the Vatican. It is equally significant that "The Prince", by <a href="../cathen/09501a.htm">Machiavelli</a>, was published with <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> licence, though afterwards severely prohibited. This toleration of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> bore one good consequence: it allowed historical criticism to begin fair. There was need of a revision which is not yet complete, ranging over all that had been handed down from the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> under the style and title of the Fathers, the Councils, he Roman and other official archives. In all these departments <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> and interpolation as well as <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> had wrought mischief on a great scale.

<p>In 1440 Lorenzo Valla counselled <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a> not to rely upon the Donation of Constantine, which be proved to be spurious. Valla's tract was printed by Ulrich von Hutten; it became popular among Germans, and influenced <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. But it opened to this enemy of the temporal power a place in the household of <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>. For another commencement of criticism we are indebted to the same unpleasant but sharp-sighted man of letters. It was Valla who first denied the authenticity of those writings which for centuries had been going about as the treatises composed by <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius the Areopagite</a>. Three centuries later the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of St. Maur and the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> were still engaged in sifting out the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> in patristic literature, in <a href="../cathen/07106b.htm">hagiology</a>, in the story of the foundation of local churches. <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a>, Ruinart, Papebroch, and their successors have cleared the ground for research into the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> origins; they have enabled divines to consider a theory of development, the materials of which were hopelessly confused when Valla tilted against the Donation itself, accepted and deplored as a fact by <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>. How great that confusion was, the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> editions of the Fathers, which largely put an end to it, abundantly show: the "authentic and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> evidences of historical religion" could not be given their full value until this work was done. It called for a disposition at once literary and critical, which the old method of training did not create and scarcely would tolerate. But this chapter falls outside the limits of our subject.

<p>It is remarkable that the healthy <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> use of ancient literature was destined to be taught by a Spanish reforming saint, himself not learned and certainly no <em>dilettante</em>. This was Ignatius Loyola, whose antecedents did not promise him the inheritance which <a href="../cathen/02425e.htm">Bembo</a> and the other Ciceronian pendants had turned to such ill account. St. Ignatius, who began his order in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, who walked the same streets with <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a>, <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, and Rabelais, did the most astonishing feat recorded in modern history. He reformed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by means of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> when sunk to its lowest ebb; and he took the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> Classics from neo-pagans to make them instruments of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> had been but little affected by the Renaissance. In temper crusading and still <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a>, its poetry, drama, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, were distinguished by qualities peculiarly its own. The Italian manner had not yet imitators at its court when Ignatius wrote <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">chivalrous</a> sonnets to an unknown lady. His intensely practical turn of mind led him to employ every talent in the Divine service; and he saw that learning, if it could be cleansed from its present stains, would not only adorn but defend the Holy Place. He had looked into the lighter productions of <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a>; they gave him a shock; but he recognized the power, if not the charm, which <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> wielded over young imaginations. His militant company took up again, without distinctly perceiving it, the task that <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> intended and <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a> had set before <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> two hundred years previously.

<p>In May, 1527, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was laid waste, its <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> profaned, its <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> pillaged, by a rabble of miscreants. "But", said <a href="../cathen/03145c.htm">Cardinal Cajetan</a>, "it was a just judgment on the Romans." The <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> Renaissance fell, stricken to death; it was high time for the <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a> to begin. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> took in hand to distinguish between what was permissible and what was forbidden in dealing with literature. The Roman Index was established by <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>. A rigorous censorship watched over the Italian printing press. By 1600 German importation of books across the Alps had ceased. If we would reckon the greatness of the change now wrought, we may compare the "Orlando Furioso" of <a href="../cathen/01712b.htm">Ariosto</a>, dedicated in 1516 to Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, with <a href="../cathen/14463d.htm">Tasso's</a> "Gerusalemme", especially as revised by the poet himself, and at the dictation of the Roman censor, Antoniano. It was a change so marked that Scalinger termed the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> generally <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrites</a>; but we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from the calendar of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> at this time and other sources how much had been done to check the wild licence of thought and speech in the Peninsula. <a href="../cathen/03016a.htm">Giordano Bruno</a>, renegade and pantheist, was burnt in 1600; <a href="../cathen/03221b.htm">Campanella</a> spent long years in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. The different measures meted out to <a href="../cathen/04352b.htm">Copernicus</a> by <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> and to <a href="../cathen/06342b.htm">Galileo</a> by <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> need no comment. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> aimed henceforth at becoming an "ideal government under spiritual and converted men". <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> was the last who could be deemed a Renaissance pontiff (1623-44).

<p>St. Ignatius, alive to the causes which had provoked many nations into revolt from the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, made learning, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and obedience governing principles in his plan of reform. The old system of arts and teaching was already growing obsolete, previous to 1450. <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> had begun to take the place of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>. Vittorino da Feltre (1378-1446), a devout <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, set up his classes at <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a> in 1435 on the basis of good Latin, including poetry, oratory, Roman history, and <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> discipline. He gave an all-round training: social, physical, religious. At <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> his friend <a href="../cathen/07053a.htm">Guarino</a> (1370-1460) was another eminent schoolmaster, mighty in Greek. We have seen how <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> by example and by criticism advanced the cause of literature, which was henceforth acknowledged as the proper subject of a liberal <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. A gentleman&mdash;the <em>cortegiano</em> whom <a href="../cathen/03409c.htm">Castiglione</a> described&mdash;ought to be proficient in the language of antiquity; such was the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> everywhere; and such it remains in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to this day. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Order</a>, springing up after 1530, not founded on the tradition of Benedict or <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">Dominic</a>, adopted this view, and their <a href="../cathen/12654a.htm">"Ratio Studiorum"</a> (1599) was, in consequence, a literary classical scheme. The first of their colleges arose at Coimbra (1542); in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> they had the Hotel de Clermont; in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> they began at Ingoldstadt. The German College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, due to <a href="../cathen/06213a.htm">St. Francis Borgia</a>, like the Roman College of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> itself, the English and other houses governed by them, attested their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for learning and their success in controversy. The Fathers were always cultivated men; they taught "a good silver Latin": and they wrote with ease, though scarcely with such idiomatic vivacity as we admire in <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> and Joseph Scaliger. Soon they possessed a hundred houses and colleges; "For nearly three centuries", says a recent critic, "they were accounted the best schoolmasters in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>." <a href="../cathen/02192a.htm">Bacon's</a> judgment can never be passed over: "As for the pedagogical part, the shortest rule would be, consult the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; for nothing better has been put in practice." (De Augment., VI, 4). They established free day-schools, devised new schoolbooks, expurgated objectionable authors, preached sound doctrines in a clear Latin style, and bestowed even upon the technicalities of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> in a certain grace. Some, like Mariana, wrote with native power in the classic forms. But their most telling man in the field of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> is <a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Petavius</a>, who belongs to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the seventeenth century. His large volumes on the Fathers may be compared in point of language with <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin's</a> "Institutes" and the "Augustinus" of Jansen. They discard the method familiar to <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>; they furnish to some extent criticism as well as history. And they suggest the development of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> with an approach to its philosophy, which neither <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> nor <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> could quite comprehend.

<p>All these things form part of "that matured and completed Renaissance" whereby the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> was purged out which had made it perilous in the same degree to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and to <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> and other <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> did well in not refusing to add culture, even the finest of the Greek, to religion. Their fault lay in the weakness which could not resist <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> luxury and a frivolous dilettantism. Now serious work was undertaken for the good of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> reformed the calendar; the text of the canon law was corrected under <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> and <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Latin Vulgate</a> after years of revision attained its actual shape; and the Vatican <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> came forth in 1587. <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, urged by St. Phillip Neri, brought out eleven folio volumes of "the greatest <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> ever written". The <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a>, enlarged and edited anew, was republished by authority of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a> and <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>.

<p>But the Renaissance had indulged its "pride of state, of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and of system" with disastrous consequences to our <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> inheritance. It trampled on the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> and failed to understand that in them which was truly original. The Latin of Cicero which urban VIII cultivated, the metres of Horace, did grievous wrong to the prose and verse of our church offices, so far as they were altered. The showy architecture now designed, though sometimes magnificent, was not inspired by religion; before long it sank to the <a href="../cathen/13106a.htm">rococo</a> and the grotesque; and it filled the churches with <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> monuments to disedifying celebrities. In <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> we descend from the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> of <a href="../cathen/01483b.htm">Fra Angelico</a> to the "corregiosity" of Corregio, may, lower still, for Venus too often masquerades as the Madonna. <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> became a thing of the past when the Gothic <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was looked upon as barbarous even by such champions of the Faith as <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> and <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a>. Never did a poet inspired by Renaissance models&mdash;not even Vida nor <a href="../cathen/13449d.htm">Sannazzaro</a>&mdash;rise to the sublimity of the "Dies Irae" never did that style produce a work equal to the "Imitation". <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> triumphs as the supreme <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> singer; <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> cannot be dethroned from his sovereignty as the <a href="../cathen/05074a.htm">Angelic Doctor</a>, still, as regards <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and philosophy, he is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> "master of those that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>". But <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> lived before the Renaissance. It was not large or liberal enough to absorb the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Hence its failure at the beginning as a philosophic movement, its lack of the deepest human motives, its superficiality and its pedantries; hence, afterwards, its fall into the commonplace, and the extinction of art in vulgarity, of literature in empty rhetoric. Hence, finally, the need of a <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> to teach it that life was something more serious than a "Carnevalde Venise", and of Romanticism to discover, among the ruined choirs and in the neglected shrines which men had scornfully passed by, tokens of that mighty <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> genius, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, Latin, Teuton, and French, misunderstanding of which was the folly, and the spoiling of its achievements the crime, that we must charge upon the Renaissance in the day of its power. "It remained for a later age", says one who glorified it, "to conceive the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> method of effecting a scientific reconciliation of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sentiment with the imagery, the legends, the theories about the world, of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> poetry and philosophy" (Pater, "Renaissance", 49). Not less did it become the task of Goethe, Scott, <a href="../cathen/03640a.htm">Chateaubriand</a>, Ruskin, of Friedrich Schlegel and the best German critics, to show that <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> culture, <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> from the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, would have been a pale reflection of dead antiquity.
