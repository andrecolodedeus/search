<h1>The Rite of Constantinople</h1>  

<p>(<em>Also</em> BYZANTINE RITE.)

<p>The Liturgies, <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, forms for the administration of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and for various <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>, <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcisms</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople, which is now, after the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, by far the most widely spread in the world. With one insignificant exception &#151; the Liturgy of St. James is used once a year at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and Zakynthos (Zacynthus) &#151; it is followed exclusively by all Orthodox Churches, by the Melkites (Melchites) in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the Uniats in the Balkans and the Italo-Greeks in Calabria, Apulia, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>. So that more than a hundred millions of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> perform their devotions according to the Rite of Constantinople.
<h2 id="section1">History</h2>

<p>This is not one of the original parent-rites. It is derived from that of Antioch. Even apart from the external evidence a comparison of the two <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> will show that Constantinople follows Antioch in the disposition of the parts. There are two original Eastern types of liturgy: that of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, in which the great Intercession comes before the Consecration, and that of Antioch, in which it follows after the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a>. The Byzantine use in both its Liturgies (of <a href="../cathen/02321a.htm">St. Basil</a> and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>) follows exactly the order of Antioch. A number of other parallels make the fact of this derivation clear from internal evidence, as it is from external witness. The tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople ascribes the oldest of its two Liturgies to <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil the Great</a> (d. 379), <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of C&aelig;sarea in Cappadocia. This tradition is confirmed by contemporary evidence. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that St. Basil made a reformation of the Liturgy of his Church, and that the Byzantine service called after him represents his reformed Liturgy in its chief parts, although it has undergone further modification since his time. St. Basil himself speaks on several occasions of the changes he made in the services of C&aelig;sarea. He writes to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Neo-C&aelig;sarea in <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> to complain of opposition against himself on account of the new way of singing psalms introduced by his authority (Ep. Basilii, cvii, Patr. Gr., XXXII, 763). <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzos</a> (Nazianzen, d. 390) says that Basil had reformed the order of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> (<em>euchon diataxis</em> &#151; Orat. xx, P.G., XXXV, 761). <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> (died c. 395) compares his brother Basil with Samuel because he "carefully arranged the form of the Service" (<em>Hierourgia</em>, In laudem fr. Bas., P.G., XLVI, 808). Prokios (Proclus) of Constantinople (d. 446) writes: "When the great Basil . . . saw the carelessness and degeneracy of men who feared the length of the Liturgy &#151; not as if he thought it too long &#151; he shortened its form, so as to remove the weariness of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and assistants" (De traditione divin&aelig; Miss&aelig;, P.G., XLV, 849).

<p>The first question that presents itself is: What rite was it that Basil modified and shortened? Certainly it was that used at C&aelig;sarea before his time. And this was a local form of the great Antiochene use, doubtless with many local variations and additions. That the original rite that stands at the head of this line of development is that of Antioch is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from the disposition of the present Liturgy of St. Basil, to which we have already referred; from the fact that, before the rise of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, Antioch was the head of the Churches of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> as well as of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> (and invariably in the East the patriarchal see gives the norm in <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> matters, followed and then gradually modified by its suffragan Churches); and lastly by the absence of any other source. At the head of all Eastern rites stand the uses of Antioch and <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. Lesser and later Churches do not invent an entirely new service for themselves, but form their practice on the model of one of these two. <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Palestine, and <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> in <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> matters derive from Antioch, just as <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11147a.htm">Nubia</a> do from <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. The two Antiochene <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> now extant are; <ol><li>that of the Eighth Book of the Apostolic Constitutions and <li>parallel to it in every way, the Greek Liturgy of St. James (see <a href="../cathen/01571a.htm">ANTIOCHENE LITURGY</a>).</ol>

<p>These are the starting-points of the development we can follow. But it is not to be supposed that St. Basil had before him either of these services, as they now stand, when he made the changes in question. In the first place, his source is rather the Liturgy of St. James than that of the Apostolic Constitutions. There are parallels to both in the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> Rite; but the likeness is much greater to that of St. James. From the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">Eucharistic prayer</a> (<em>Vere dignum et justum est</em>, our Preface) to the dismissal, Basil's order is almost exactly that of James. But the now extant Liturgy of St. James (in Brightman, "Liturgies Eastern and Western", 31-68) has itself been considerably modified in later years. Its earlier part especially (the Liturgy of the Catechumens and the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a>) is certainly later than the time of St. Basil. In any case, then, we must go back to the <em>original</em> Antiochene Rite as the source. But neither was this the immediate origin of the reform. It must be remembered that all living rites are subject to gradual modification through use. The outline and frame remain; into this frame new <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are fitted. As a general rule <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> keep the disposition of their parts, but tend to change the text of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. St. Basil took as the basis of his reform the use of C&aelig;sarea in the fourth century. There is reason to believe that that use, while retaining the essential order of the original Antiochene service, had already considerably modified various parts, especially the actual <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. We have seen, for instance, that Basil shortened the Liturgy. But the service that bears his name is not at all shorter than the present one of St. James. We may, then, suppose that by his time the Liturgy of C&aelig;sarea had been considerably lengthened by additional <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> (this is the common development of Liturgies). When we say, then, that the rite of Constantinople that bears his name is the Liturgy of St. James as modified by St. Basil, it must be understood that Basil is rather the chief turning-point in its development than the only author of the change. It had already passed through a period of development before his time, and it has developed further since. Nevertheless, St. Basil and his reform of the rite of his own city are the starting-point of the special use of Constantinople.



<p>A comparison of the present Liturgy of St. Basil with earlier allusions shows that in its chief parts it is really the service composed by him. <a href="../cathen/11783c.htm">Peter the Deacon</a>, who was sent by the Scythian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to Pope Hormisdas to defend a famous formula they had drawn up ("One of the Trinity was crucified") about the year 512, writes: "The blessed Basil, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of C&aelig;sarea, says in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the holy altar which is used by nearly the whole East: Give, oh Lord, strength and protection; make the bad good, we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, keep the good in their virtue; for Thou canst do all things, and no one can withstand Thee; Thou dost save whom Thou wilt and no one can hinder Thy will" (Petri diac. Ep. ad Fulgent, vii, 25, in P.L., LXV, 449). This is a compilation of three texts in the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> Liturgy: Keep the good in their virtue; <em>make the bad good by thy mercy</em> (Brightman, op. cit., pp. 333-334); the words: <em>Give, O Lord, strength and protection</em> come several times at the beginning of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>; and the last words are an acclamation made by the choir or people at the end of several (<a href="../cathen/12769a.htm">Renaudot</a>, I, p. xxxvii). The Life of St. Basil ascribed to Amphilochios (P.G., XXIX, 301, 302) quotes as composed by him the beginning of the Introduction-prayer and that of the <a href="../cathen/05380b.htm">Elevation</a> exactly as they are in the existing Liturgy (Brightman, 319, 341). The <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Second Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> (787) says: "As all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the holy Liturgy <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, Basil says in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the Divine <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a>: We approach with confidence to the holy altar . . .". The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is the one that follows the Anamnesis in St. Basil's Liturgy (Brightman, p. 329. Cf. <a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a>, IV, p. 371).

<p>From these and similar indications we conclude that the Liturgy of St. Basil in its oldest extant form is substantially authentic, namely, from the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> to the Communion. The Mass of the Catechumens and the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> have developed since his death. <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a>, in describing the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> famous encounter with <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> at C&aelig;sarea, in 372, describes the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> as a simpler rite, accompanied with psalms sung by the people but without an audible <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> (Greg. Naz., Or., xliii, 52, P.G., XXXVI, 561). This oldest form of the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> Liturgy is contained in a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the Barberini Library of about the year 800 (<a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, III, 55, reprinted in Brightman, 309-344). The Liturgy of St. Basil now used in the Orthodox and Melkite (or <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a>) Churches (Euchologion, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1898, pp. 75-97; Brightman, 400-411) is printed after that of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> and differs from it only in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> said by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, chiefly in the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a>; it has received further unimportant modifications. It is probable that even before the time of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> the Liturgy of Basil was used at Constantinople. We have seen that <a href="../cathen/11783c.htm">Peter the Deacon</a> mentions that it was "used by nearly the whole East". It would seem that the importance of the See of C&aelig;sarea (even beyond its own exarchy), the fame of St. Basil, and the practical convenience of this short Liturgy led to its adoption by many Churches in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. The "East" in <a href="../cathen/11783c.htm">Peter the Deacon's</a> remark would probably mean the Roman Prefecture of the East (<em>Pr&aelig;fectura Orientis</em>) that included Thrace. Moreover, when <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzos</a> came to Constantinople to administer that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (381) he found in use there a Liturgy that was practically the same as the one he had known at home in Cappadocia. His Sixth Oration (P.G., XXXV, 721 sq.) was held in Cappadocia, his Thirty-eighth (P.G., XXXVI, 311) at Constantinople. In both he refers to and quotes the <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">Eucharistic prayer</a> that his hearers <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. A comparison of the two texts shows that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is the same. This proves that, at any rate in its most important element, the liturgy used at the capital was that of Cappadocia &#151; the one that St. Basil used as a basis of his reform. It would therefore be most natural that the reform too should in time be adopted at Constantinople. But it would seem that before <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> this <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> Rite (according to the universal rule) had received further development and additions at Constantinople. It has been suggested that the oldest form of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Liturgy is the original Byzantine Rite, the one that <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> found in use when he became patriarch (Probst, "Lit. des IV. Jahrhts.", 413).

<p>The next epoch in the history of the Byzantine Rite is the reform of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> (d. 407). He not only further modified the Rite of Basil, but left both his own reformed Liturgy and the unreformed <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> one itself, as the exclusive uses of Constantinople. St. John became <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople in 397; he reigned there till 403, was then banished, but came back in the same year; was banished again in 404, and died in exile in 407. The tradition of his Church says that during the time of his <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> he composed from the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> Liturgy a shorter form that is the one still in common use throughout the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>. The same text of Proklos (Proclus) quoted above continues: "Not long afterwards our father, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">John Chrysostom</a>, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of his flock as a shepherd should be, considering the carelessness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, thoroughly rooted up every diabolical objection. He therefore left out a great part and shortened all the forms lest anyone . . . stay away from this Apostolic and Divine Institution", etc. He would, then, have treated St. Basil's rite exactly as Basil treated the older rite of C&aelig;sarea. There is no reason to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> this tradition in the main issue. A comparison of the Liturgy of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> with that of Basil will show that it follows the same order and is shortened considerably in the text of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>; a further comparison of its text with the numerous allusions to the rite of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> in <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom's</a> <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> will show that the oldest form we have of the Liturgy agrees substantially with the one he describes (Brightman, 530-534). But it is also certain that the modern Liturgy of St. Chrysostom has received considerable modifications and additions since his time. In order to reconstruct the rite used by him we must take away from the present Liturgy all the Preparation of the Offerings (<em>Proskomide</em>), the ritual of the Little and Great Entrances, and the Creed. The service began with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> greeting, "Peace to all", and the answer, "And with thy spirit." The lessons followed from the Prophets and Apostles, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> read the Gospel. After the Gospel the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> preached a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> over the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> was said. Originally it had been followed by a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> over penitents, but Nektarios (381-397) had abolished the discipline of public penance, so in <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom's</a> Liturgy this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is left out. Then came a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the faithful (<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>) and the dismissal of the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>. <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> mentions a new ritual for the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a>: the choir accompanied the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and formed a solemn procession to bring the <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> from the prothesis to the altar (Hom. xxxvi, in I Cor., vi, P.G., LXI, 313). Nevertheless the present ceremonies and the Cherubic Chant that accompany the Great Entrance are a later development (Brightman, op. cit., 530). The <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">Kiss</a> of Peace apparently preceded the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> in <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom's</a> time (Brightman, op. cit., 522, Probst, op. cit., 208). The <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">Eucharistic prayer</a> began, as everywhere, with the dialogue: "Lift up your hearts" etc. This <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, which is clearly an abbreviated form of that in the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> Rite, is certainly authentically of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a>. It is apparently chiefly in reference to it that Proklos says that he has shortened the older rite. The Sanctus was sung by the people as now. The ceremonies performed by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> at the words of Institution are a later addition. Probst thinks that the original <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> ended at the words "Send thy Holy Spirit down on us and on these gifts spread before us" (Brightman, op. cit., 386), and that the continuation (especially the disconnected interruption: <em><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be merciful to me a sinner</em>, now inserted into the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a>; Maltzew, "Die Liturgien" etc., <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 1894, p. 88) are a later addition (op. cit., 414). The Intercession followed at once, beginning with a memory of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayer for the dead</a> came before that for the living (ibid., 216-415). The <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">Eucharistic prayer</a> ended with a <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm">doxology</a> to which the people answered, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>; and then the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> greeted them with the text, "The mercy of our great <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> be with all of you" (<a href="../bible/tit002.htm#vrs13">Titus 2:13</a>), to which they answered: "And with thy spirit", as usual. The <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> followed, introduced by a short <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> spoken by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and followed by the well-known <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm">doxology</a>: "For thine is the kingdom" etc. This ending was added to the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Our Father</a> in the Codex of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> used by <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> (cf. Hom. xix in P.G., LVII, 282). Another greeting (Peace to all) with its answer introduced the manual acts, first an <a href="../cathen/05380b.htm">Elevation</a> with the words "Holy things for the holy" etc., the Breaking of Bread and the Communion under both kinds. In <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom's</a> time it seems that people received either kind separately, drinking from the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>. A short <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of thanksgiving ended the Liturgy. That is the rite as we see it in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> (cf. Probst., op. cit., 156-202, 202-226). It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that most of these <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> were preached at Antioch (387-397) before he went to Constantinople. It would seem, then, that the Liturgy of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> was in great part that of his time at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and that he introduced it at the capital when he became patriarch. We have seen from <a href="../cathen/11783c.htm">Peter the Deacon</a> that St. Basil's Rite was used by "nearly the whole East". There is, then, no difficulty in supposing that it had penetrated to Antioch and was already abridged there into the "Liturgy of Chrysostom" before that saint brought this abridged form to Constantinople.

<p>It was this <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> Liturgy that gradually became the common Eucharistic service of Constantinople, and that spread throughout the Orthodox world, as the city that had adopted it became more and more the acknowledged head of <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Christendom</a>. It did not completely displace the older rite of St. Basil, but reduced its use to a very few days in the year on which it is still said (see below, under II). Meanwhile the Liturgy of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> itself underwent further modification. The oldest form of it now extant is in the same <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the Barberini Library that contains St. Basil's Liturgy. In this the elaborate rite of the Proskomide has not yet been added, but it has already received additions since the time of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> whose name it bears. The Trisagion (Holy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Holy Strong One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us) at the Little Entrance is said to have been revealed to Proklos of Constantinople (434-47, St. John Dam., De Fide Orth., III, 10); this probably gives the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of its insertion into the Liturgy. The Cherubikon that accompanies the Great Entrance was apparently added by Justin II (565-78, Brightman, op. cit., 532), and the Creed that follows, just before the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a>, is also ascribed to him (Joannis Biclarensis Chronicon, P.L., LXXII, 863). Since the Barberini Euchologion (ninth cent.) the Preparation of the Offerings (<em>proskomide</em>) at the credence-table (called prothesis) gradually developed into the elaborate rite that now accompanies it. Brightman (op. cit., 539-552) gives a series of documents from which the evolution of this rite may be traced from the ninth to the sixteenth century.

<p>These are the two Liturgies of Constantinople, the older one of St. Basil, now said on only a few days, and the later shortened one of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> that is in common use. There remains the third, the Liturgy of the Presanctified (<em>ton proegiasmenon</em>). This service, that in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> now occurs only on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>, was at one time used on the aliturgical days of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> everywhere (see <a href="../cathen/01314a.htm">ALITURGICAL DAYS</a> and Duchesne, Origines, 222, 238). This is still the practice of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a>. The Paschal Chronicle (see <a href="../cathen/03730b.htm">CHRONICON PASCHALE</a>) of the year 645 (P.G., XCII) mentions the Presanctified Liturgy, and the fifty-second canon of the <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Second Trullan Council</a> (692) orders: "On all days of the fast of forty days, except Saturdays and <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and the day of the Holy Annunciation, the Liturgy of the Presanctified shall be celebrated." The essence of this Liturgy is simply that the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> that has been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on the preceding Sunday, and is reserved in the tabernacle (<em>artophorion</em>) under both kinds, is taken out and distributed as Communion. It is now always celebrated at the end of <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> (<em>hesperinos</em>), which form its first part. The lessons are read as usual, and the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a> sung; the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> are dismissed, and then, the whole <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> being naturally omitted, Communion is given; the blessing and dismissal follow. A great part of the rite is simply taken from the corresponding parts of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom's</a> Liturgy. The present form, then, is a comparatively late one that supposes the normal Liturgies of Constantinople. It has been attributed to various <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> &#151; St. James, St. Peter, St. Basil, St. Germanos I of Constantinople (715-30), and so on (Brightman, op. cit., p. xciii). But in the service books it is now officially ascribed to St. Gregory Dialogos (<a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope Gregory I</a>). It is impossible to say how this certainly mistaken ascription began. The Greek legend is that, when he was apocrisiarius at Constantinople (578), seeing that the Greeks had no fixed rite for this Communion-service, he composed this one for them.

<p>The origin of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> and of the rites for <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a> in the Byzantine Church is more difficult to trace. Here too we have now the result of a long and gradual development; and the starting-point of that development is certainly the use of Antioch. But there are no names that stand out as clearly as do those of St. Basil and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> in the history of the Liturgy. We may perhaps find the trace of a similar action on their part in the case of the Office. The new way of singing psalms introduced by St. Basil (Ep. cvii, see above) would in the first place affect the canonical Hours. It was the manner of singing psalms antiphonally, that is alternately by two choirs, to which we are accustomed, that had already been introduced at Antioch in the time of the Patriarch Leontios (Leontius, 344-57; Theodoret, <a href="../fathers/27022.htm"><em>Church History</em> II.24</a>). We find one or two other allusions to reforms in various rites among the works of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a>; thus he desires people to accompany funerals by singing psalms (Hom. iv, in Ep. ad Hebr., P.G., LXIII, 43) etc.

<p>With regard to the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> especially, it has the same general principles in East and West from a very early age (see <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">BREVIARY</a>). Essentially it consists in psalm-singing. Its first and most important part is the Night-watch (<em>pannychis</em>, our <a href="../cathen/11087b.htm">Nocturns</a>); at dawn the <em>orthros</em> (<a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a>) was sung; during the day the people met again at the third, sixth, and ninth hours, and at sunset for the <em>hesperinos</em> (<a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>). Besides the psalms these Offices contained lessons from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and collects. A peculiarity of the Antiochene use was the "Gloria in excelsis" sung at the Orthros (Ps.-Athan., De Virg., xx, P.G., XXVIII, 276); the evening <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>, <em>Phos ilaron</em>, still sung in the Byzantine Rite at the Hesperinos and attributed to Athenogenes (in the second cent.), is quoted by St. Basil (<a href="../fathers/3203.htm"><em>On the Holy Spirit</em> 73</a>). Egeria of Aquitaine, the pilgrim to Jerusalem, gives a vivid description of the Office as sung there according to Antioch in the fourth century ["S. Silvi&aelig; (sic) peregrin.", ed. Gamurrini, Rome, 1887]. To this series of Hours two were added in the fourth century. John Cassian (Instit., III, iv) describes the addition of Prime by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Palestine, and St. Basil refers (loc. cit.) to <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Complin</a> (<em>apodeipnon</em>) as the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks'</a> evening <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Prime and <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Complin</a>, then, were originally private <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> said by <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in addition to the official Hours. The Antiochene manner of keeping this Office was famous all over the East. Flavian of Antioch in 387 softened the heart of <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a> (after the outrage to the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>) by making his clerks sing to him "the suppliant chants of Antioch" (<a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, <a href="../fathers/26027.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.23</a>). And <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, as soon as he comes to Constantinople, introduces the methods of Antioch in keeping the canonical Hours (16, VIII, 8). Eventually the eastern Office admits short services (<em>mesoorai</em>) between the day Hours, and between <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> and <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Complin</a>. Into this frame a number of famous poets have fitted a long succession of canons (unmetrical <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>); of these poets <a href="../cathen/13154a.htm">St. Romanos</a> the singer (sixth cent.), St. Cosmas the singer (eighth cent.), <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a> (c. 780), <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">St. Theodore of Studion</a> (d. 826), etc., are the most famous (see <a href="../cathen/03113a.htm">BYZANTINE LITERATURE</a>, sub-title IV. <em>Ecclesiastical</em> etc.). St. Sabas (d. 532) and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a> eventually arranged the Office for the whole year, though, like the Liturgy, it has undergone further development since, till it acquired its present form (see below).
<h2 id="section2">The Byzantine Rite at the present time</h2>

<p>The Rite of Constantinople now used throughout the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> does not maintain any principle of uniformity in language. In various countries the same <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and forms are translated (with unimportant variations) into what is supposed to be more or less the vulgar tongue. As a matter of fact, however, it is only in Rumania that the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language is the same as that of the people. Greek (from which all the others are translated) is used at Constantinople, in <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a> (by the Patriarchists), <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, by Greek <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in Palestine and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, by nearly all Orthodox in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; Arabic in parts of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Palestine, and by a few churches in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; Old Slavonic throughout <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, in <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, and by all Exarchists, in Czernagora, <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servia</a>, and by the Orthodox in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>; and Rumanian by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of that country. These four are the principal languages. Later Russian missions use Esthonian, Lettish, and German in the Baltic provinces, Finnish and Tatar in <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a> and Siberia, <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a>. (Brightman, op. cit., LXXXI-LXXXII). Although the Liturgy has been translated into English (see Hapgood, op. cit. in bibliography), a translation is never used in any church of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>. The Uniats use Greek at Constantinople, in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and partially in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Arabic chiefly in these countries, Old Slavonic in <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> lands, and Rumanian in <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumania</a>. It is curious to note that in spite of this great diversity of languages the ordinary Orthodox <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> no more understands his Liturgy than if it were in Greek. Old Slavonic and the semi-classical Arabic in which it is sung are dead languages.
<h3>The calendar</h3>

<p>It is well known that the Orthodox still use the Julian Calendar (Old Style). By this time (1908) they are thirteen days behind us. Their <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> year begins on 1 September, "the beginning of the Indict, that is of the new year". On 15 November begins the first of their four great <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, the "fast of <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christ's birth</a>" that lasts till <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> (25 December). The fast of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> begins on the Monday after the sixth Sunday before <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, and they abstain from flesh-meat after the seventh Sunday before the feast (our <a href="../cathen/13747a.htm">Sexagesima</a>). The fast of the Apostles lasts from the day after the first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> after Pentecost (their <a href="../cathen/01315a.htm">All Saints' Day</a>) till 28 June, the fast of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> from 1 August to 14 August. Throughout this year fall a great number of feasts. The great cycles are the same as ours &#151; <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, followed by a Memory of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> on 26 December, then St. Stephen on 27 December, etc. <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">Ascension Day</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15614b.htm">Whitsunday</a> follow as with us. Many of the other feasts are the same as ours, though often with different names. They divide them into three categories, feasts of our Lord (<em>heortai despotikai</em>), of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> (<em>theometrikai</em>), and of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> (<em>ton hagion</em>). They count the "Holy meeting" (with St. Simeon, 2 February), the Annunciation (25 March), the Awakening of Lazarus (Saturday before <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a>), etc., as feasts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>. The chief feasts of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> are her birthday (8 September), Presentation in the Temple (21 November), Conception (9 December), Falling-asleep (<em>koimesis</em>, 15 August), and the Keeping of her Robe at the Blachern&aelig; (at Constantinople, 2 July). Feasts are further divided according to their solemnity into three classes: great, middle, and less days. <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> of course stands alone as greatest of all. It is "The Feast" (<em>he heorte</em>, <em>al-id</em>); there are twelve other very great days and twelve great ones. Certain chief <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> (the Apostles, the three holy hierarchs &#151; Sts. Basil, <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">John Chrysostom</a> &#151; 30 January, the holy and equal-to-the-Apostles Sovereigns, Constantine and Helen, etc.) have middle feasts; all the others are lesser ones. The <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> are named after the subject of their Gospel; the first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> is the feast of Orthodoxy (after <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclasm</a>), the Saturdays before Meatless Sunday (our <a href="../cathen/13747a.htm">Sexagesima</a>) and <a href="../cathen/15614b.htm">Whitsunday</a> are All Souls' days. Our <a href="../cathen/15058a.htm">Trinity Sunday</a> is their All Saints. Wednesdays and Fridays throughout the year are days of abstinence (Fortescue, "Orth. Eastern Church", 398-401).
<h3>Service-books</h3>

<p>The Byzantine Rite has no such compendiums as our <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> and <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>; it is contained in a number of loosely arranged books. They are: the <em>Typikon</em>), a perpetual calendar containing full directions for all feasts and all possible coincidences. The (<em>Euchologion</em>) contains the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> part of the Hesperinos, Orthros, the three Liturgies, and other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a>. The <em>Triodion</em> contains the variable parts of the Liturgy and <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> (except the psalms, Epistles, and Gospels) for the movable days from the tenth Sunday before <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> to <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>. The <em>Pentekostarion</em> continues the Triodion from <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Day</a> to the first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> after Pentecost (All Saints' Sunday). The <em>Oktoechos</em> gives the Offices of the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> for the rest of the year (arranged according to the eight modes to which they are sung &#151; <em>okto echoi</em>) and the <em>Parakletike</em> is for the weekdays. The twelve <em>Menaias</em>, one for each month, contain the Proper of Saints; the <em>Menologion</em> is a shortened version of the <a href="../cathen/10177b.htm">Menaia</a>, and the <em>Horologion</em> contains the choir's part of the day Hours. The <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> (<em>psalterion</em>), Gospel (<em>enaggelion</em>), and Apostle (<em>apostolos</em> &#151; Epistles and Acts) contain the parts of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> read (Fortescue, "Orth. E. Ch.", 401-402; <a href="../cathen/11078a.htm">Nilles</a>, "Kal. Man.", XLIV-LVI; Kattenbusch, "Confessionskunde", I, 478-486).
<h3>The altar, vestments and sacred vessels</h3>

<p>A church of the Byzantine Rite should have only one altar. In a few very large ones there are side-chapels with altars, and the Uniats sometimes copy the Latin multitude of altars in one church; this in an abuse that is not consistent with their rite. The altar (<em>he hagia trapeza</em>) stands in the middle of the sanctuary (<em>ierateion</em>); it is covered to the ground with a linen cloth over which is laid a silk or velvet covering. The Euchologion, a folded antimension, and perhaps one or two other instruments used in the Liturgy are laid on it; nothing else. [See <a href="../cathen/01359b.htm">ALTAR (IN THE GREEK CHURCH)</a>.] Behind the altar, round the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a>, are seats for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> throne in the middle (in every church). On the north side of the altar stands a large credence-table (<em>prothesis</em>); the first part of the Liturgy is said here. On the south side is the diakonikon, a sort of <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> where vessels and vestments are kept; but it is in no way walled off from the rest of the sanctuary. The sanctuary is divided from the rest of the church by the ikonostasis (<em>eikonostasis</em>, picture-screen), a great screen stretching across the whole width and reaching high up to the roof (see sub-title <em>The Iconostasis</em> s.v. <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">HISTORY OF THE CHRISTIAN ALTAR</a>). On the outside it is covered with a great number of pictures of Christ and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, arranged in a more or less determined order (Christ always to the right of the royal doors and the Bl. Virgin on the left), before which rows of lamps are hung. The ikonostasis has three doors, the "royal door" in the middle, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> door to the south (right hand as one enters the church), and another door to the north. Between the royal door and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> door the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has another throne facing the people. Immediately outside the ikonostasis is the choir. A great part of the services take place here. In the body of the church the people stand (there are no seats as a rule); then comes the <a href="../cathen/10704b.htm">narthex</a>, a passage across the church at the west end, from which one enters by doors into the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>. Most of the funeral rites and other services take place in the <a href="../cathen/10704b.htm">narthex</a>. Churches are roofed as a rule by a succession of low <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupolas</a>, often five (if the church is cross-shaped). In <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> there is generally a <a href="../cathen/02394d.htm">belfry</a>. The vestments were once the same as the Latin ones, though now they look very different. It is a curious case of parallel evolution. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> wears over his cassock the <em>sticharion</em> our <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>; it is often of silk and coloured; then the <em>epitrachelion</em>, a stole of which the two ends are sewn together and hang straight down in front, with a loop through which the head is passed. The sticharion and epitrachelion are held together by the <em>zone</em> (girdle), a narrow belt of stuff with clasps. Over the wrists he wears the <em>epimanikia</em>, cuffs or gloves with the part for the hand cut off. From the girdle the <em>epigonation</em>, a diamond-shaped piece of stuff, stiffened with cardboard, hangs down to the right knee. Lastly, he wears over all the <em>sakkos</em>, a vestment like our <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>. Over the sakkos comes the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm#omophorion"><em>omophorion</em></a>. This is a great <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> of silk <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidered</a> with crosses. There is also a smaller <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm#omophorion">omophorion</a> for some rites. He has a <a href="../cathen/11601a.htm">pectoral cross</a>, an <em>enkolpion</em> (a <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medal</a> containing a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a>), a <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> formed of metal and shaped like an imperial crown, and a <em>dikanikion</em>, or <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>, shorter than ours and ending in two serpents between which is a cross. To give his blessing in the Liturgy he uses the <em>trikerion</em> in his right and the <em>dikerion</em> in his left hand. These are a triple and double candlestick with candles. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> wears the sticharion, epitrachelion, zone, and epimanikia. If he is a dignitary he wears the epigonation and (in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>) the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> also. Instead of a sakkos he has a <em>phainolion</em>, our <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a>, but reaching to the feet behind and at the sides, and cut away in front (see <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">CHASUBLE</a> and illustrations). The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> wears the sticharion and epimanikia, but no girdle. His stole is called an <em>orarion</em>; it is pinned to the left shoulder and hangs straight down, except that he winds it around his body and over the right shoulder at the Communion. It is <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidered</a> with the word "HAGIOS" three times. A very common abuse (among Melkites too) is for other servers to wear the orarion. This is expressly forbidden by the Council of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> (c. 360, can. xxii). The Byzantine Rite has no sequence of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> colours. They generally use black for funerals, otherwise any colours for any day. The vessels used for the holy Liturgy are the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a> (<em>diskos</em>), which latter is much larger than ours and has a foot to stand it (it is never put on the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>), the <em>asteriskos</em> (a cross of bent metal that stands over the <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a> to prevent the veil from touching the holy bread), the spoon (<em>labis</em>) for giving Communion, the spear (<em>logche</em>) to cut up the bread, and the fan (<em>hripidion</em>) which the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> waves over the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> &#151; this is a flat piece of metal shaped like an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> head with six wings and a handle. The <em>antimension</em>) is a kind of corporal containing <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> that is spread out at the beginning of the Liturgy. It is really a <a href="../cathen/01348b.htm">portable altar</a>. The <em>Holy Bread</em> (always leavened of course) is made as a flat loaf marked in squares to be cut up during the Proskomide with the letters IC. XC. NI. KA. (<em>Iesous Christos nika</em>). In the diakonikon a vessel is kept with hot water for the Liturgy (Fortescue, op. cit., 403-409; "Echos d'Orient", V, 129-139; R. Storff, "Die griech. Liturg.", 13-14).
<h3>Church music</h3>

<p>The singing in the Byzantine Rite is always unaccompanied. No musical instrument of any kind may be used in their churches. They have a <a href="../cathen/12144a.htm">plain chant</a> of eight modes that correspond to ours, except that they are numbered differently; the four authentic modes (Doric, Phrygian, Lydian, and Mixolydian &#151; our 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th) come first, then the Plagal modes (our 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th). But their scales are different. Whereas our <a href="../cathen/12144a.htm">plainsong</a> is strictly diatonic, theirs is enharmonic with variable intervals. They always sing in unison and frequently change the mode in the middle of a chant. One singer (generally a boy) sings the dominant (<em>to ison</em>) of the mode to the sound of A continuously, while the rest execute their elaborate pneums (see <a href="../cathen/12144a.htm">PLAIN CHANT</a>). The result is generally &#151; to our ears &#151; unmelodious and strange, though in some cases a carefully trained choir produces a fine effect. One of the best is that of St. Anne's (Melkite) College at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, trained by the French P&egrave;res Blancs. One of these, P&egrave;re Rebours, has written an exhaustive and practical treatise of their chant ("Trait&eacute; de psaltique" etc.; see bibliography). In <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and lately, to some extent, in the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> church of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> they sing figured music in parts of a very stately and beautiful kind. It is probably the most beautiful and suitable <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a> in the world.
<h3>The holy liturgy</h3>

<p>The present use of the Byzantine Rite confines the older Liturgy of St. Basil to the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> (except <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a>), <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>, also the eves of <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> and the Epiphany, and St. Basil's feast (1 January). On all other days on which the Liturgy is celebrated they use that of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a>. But on the weekdays in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> (except Saturdays) they may not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a>, so they use for them the Liturgy of the Presanctified. An Orthodox <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> does not celebrate every day, but as a rule only on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feast-days. The Uniats, however, in this, as in many other ways, imitate the Latin custom. They also have a curious principle that the altar as well as the celebrant must be <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, that is to say that it must not have been used already on the same day. So there is only one Liturgy a day in an <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>. Where many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are present they concelebrate, all saying the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> together over the same offerings. This happens nearly always when a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> celebrates; he is surrounded by his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who celebrate with him. The Liturgy of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a>, as being the one commonly used, is always printed first in the <a href="../cathen/05595b.htm">Euchologia</a>. It is the framework into which the others are fitted and the greater part of the Liturgy is always said according to this form. After it are printed the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of St. Basil (always much longer) which are substituted for some of the usual ones when his rite is used, and then the variants of the Liturgy of the Presanctified. The Liturgies of Basil and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, then, differing only in a certain number of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, may be described together.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a> directs that the celebrant must be reconciled to all men, keep his heart from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts, and be <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> since midnight. At the appointed hour (usually immediately after None) the celebrant and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> (who communicates and must therefore also be <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>) say the preparatory <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> before the ikonostasis (Brightman, op. cit., 353-354), <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> the holy ikons, and go into the diakonikon. Here they vest, the celebrant blessing each vestment as it is put on, say certain <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and wash their hands, saying <a href="../bible/psa025.htm#vrs6">verses 6-12 of Psalm 25</a> ("Lavabo inter innocentes" etc., op. cit., 354-356). Then the first part of the Liturgy, the <em>Preparation of the Offering</em> (<em>proskomide</em>) begins at the credence table (<em>prothesis</em>). The loaves of bread (generally five) are marked in divisions as described above under the caption Altar, etc. The celebrant cuts away with the holy lance the parts marked IC. XC. NI. KA., and says: "The <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">Lamb of God</a> is sacrificed." These parts are then called the Lamb. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> pours wine and warm water into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>. Other parts of the bread are cut away in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the All-holy Theotokos, nine for various <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and others for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Orthodox <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and various people for whom he wishes to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. This rite is accompanied by many <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, the particles (<em>prosphorai</em>) are arranged on the diskos (paten) by the Lamb (that of the Theotokos on the right, because of the verse "The Queen stands at thy right hand". A long <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a> explains all this), covered with the asteriskos and veils, and the offerings are repeatedly <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensed</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> then <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incenses</a> the prothesis, altar, sanctuary, <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, and the celebrant. (A detailed account of the now elaborate rite of the Proskomide is given in the "Echos d'Orient", III, 65-78.) They then go to the altar, <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> the Gospel on it and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> holding up his orarion says: It is time to sacrifice to the Lord. Here begin the <em>Litanies</em> (<em>ektenai</em> or <em>synaptai</em>). The doors of the ikonostasis are opened, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> goes out through the north door. Standing before the royal doors he chants the Great Litany, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for peace, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the patriarch or synod (in Orthodox countries for the sovereign and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>), the city, travellers, etc., etc. To each clause the choir answer "Kyrie eleison". Then follows the first antiphon (on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> <a href="../bible/psa102.htm">Psalm 102</a>), and the celebrant at the altar says a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. The Short Litany is sung in the same way (the clauses are different, Brightman, op. cit., 362-375) with an antiphon and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and then a third <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a>; on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> the third antiphon is the Beatitudes.
<h3>The Little Entrance</h3>

<p>Here follows the Little Entrance. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> has gone back to the celebrant's side. They come out through the north door in procession, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> holding the book of the Gospels, with <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a> bearing candles. The troparia (short <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>) are sung, ending with the Trisagion: "Holy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Holy Strong One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us" (three times) ; then "Glory be to the Father", etc. "As it was in the beginning", etc. &#151; and again "Holy God", etc. Meanwhile the celebrant says other <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. A reader sings the Epistle; a Gradual is sung; the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> sings the Gospel, having <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensed</a> the book; more <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> follow. Then come <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, and they are dismissed by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>: "All <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> go out. Catechumens go out. All <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> go away. Not one of the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> [shall stay]." &#151; Of course nowadays there are no <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> bring us to the first variant between the two Liturgies. The one said by the celebrant is different (and, as an exception, shorter) in St. Basil's rite (Brightman, op. cit., 374 and 401). The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> says, "All the faithful again and again pray to the Lord in peace", and repeats several times the curious exclamation "Wisdom!" (<em>sophia</em>) that occurs repeatedly in the Byzantine Rite &#151; before the Gospel he says "Wisdom! Upright!" &#151; <em>sophia. orthoi.</em>, meaning that the people should stand up.
<h3>The Liturgy of the Faithful</h3>

<p>The Liturgy of the Faithful begins here. <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayers</a> for the faithful follow (different in the two rites, Brightman, op. cit., 375-377 and 400-401); and then comes the dramatic moment of the Liturgy, the <em>Great Entrance</em>. The celebrant and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> go to the prothesis, the offerings are <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensed</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> covers his shoulders with the great veil (see &AElig;R) and takes the diskos (paten) with the bread; the thurible hangs from his hand; the celebrant follows with the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>. <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">Acolytes</a> go in front and form a solemn procession. Meanwhile the choir sings the Cherubic Hymn (<em>Cheroubikos hymnos</em>): "Let us, who mystically represent the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">Cherubim</a>, and who sing to the Life-giving Trinity the thrice <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>, put away all earthly cares so as to receive the King of all things [here the procession comes out through the north door] escorted by the army of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">alleluia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">alleluia</a>." The procession goes meanwhile all round the church and enters the sanctuary by the royal doors. The Cherubic Hymn has a very elaborate and effective melody (Rebours, op. cit., 156-164) with almost endless pneums. This <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, with its allusion to the entrance of the "King of all things" before the offerings are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, is a curious instance of a dramatic representation that anticipates the real moment of the Consecration. After some more <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> at the altar, different in the two <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> cries out, "The doors! The doors! Let us attend in wisdom", and the doors of the ikonostasis are shut. The Creed is then sung.
<h3>The anaphora (canon)</h3>

<p>Here begins the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> (Canon). There is first a dialogue, "Lift up your hearts" etc., as with us, and the celebrant begins the <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">Eucharistic prayer</a>: "It is meet and just to sing to Thee, to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> Thee, praise Thee and give thanks to Thee in all places. . . ." The form in St. Basil's Rite is much longer. It is not said aloud, but at the end he lifts up his voice and says: "Crying, singing, proclaiming the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> of victory and saying:" &#151; and the choir sings "Holy, Holy, Holy" etc., as in our Mass. Very soon, after a short <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> (considerably longer in St. Basil's Rite) the celebrant comes to the words of Institution. He lifts up his Voice and sings: "Take and eat: this is my Body that is broken for you for the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>"; and through the Ikonostasis the choir answers "Amen". Then: "Drink ye all of this, this is my Blood of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> that is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." R. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> &#151; as before. The Orthodox, as is known, do not believe that these words <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a>, so they go straight on to the Anamnesis, and a special <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a> in their Euchologion (ed. <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1898, p. 63) warns them not to make any reverence here. The Uniats, on the other hand, make a profound reverence after each form. The Anamnesis (our "Unde et memores") again is longer in the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> Liturgy. The <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> follows. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> invites the celebrant in each case: "Bless, sir, the holy bread [or wine]." The two forms (of Basil and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>) may stand as specimens of the principle of abbreviation that distinguishes the later rite. In St. Basil's Liturgy it is: "We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and beseech thee, O Holy of Holy ones, that according to the mercy of thy favour thy Holy Spirit come down on us and on these present gifts to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> them, sanctify them and to make...." (<a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>: "Send down thy Holy Spirit on us and on these present gifts...."). Then, after an irrelevant interpolation, with two verses from <a href="../bible/psa050.htm">Psalm 50</a> about the celebrant's own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he continues (Basil): "this bread the precious Body itself of our Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>" (Chrys.: "and make this bread the precious Body of thy Christ"). <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">Deacon</a>: "Amen. Bless, Sir, the holy <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>." Celebrant (Basil): "But this <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> the Precious Blood itself of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>" (Chrys.: "And what it is in this Chalice the precious Blood of Thy Christ"). <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">Deacon</a>: "Amen. Bless, Sir, both." Celebrant (Basil): "That was shed for the life and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the world" (Chrys.: "Changing it by thy Holy Spirit"). <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">Deacon</a>: "Amen. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>." Both then make a deep prostration, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> waves the ripidion (fan) over the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. This <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, now interpreted mystically as a symbol of adoring <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, was certainly once a practical precaution. They have no pall over the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and there is a danger of flies. The waving of the ripidion occurs several times during the Liturgy. In the Byzantine Rite, as in all the Antiochene <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, the Intercession follows at this point. First comes a memory of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> then reads the Diptychs of the Dead, and the celebrant says a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> into which he may introduce the names of any of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> departed for whom he wishes to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayers</a> for the living follow (in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> for the second time occur the names of "Our Orthodox and Christ-loving Lord Nicholas, Czar and Autocrat of all the Russias" and of all his "right-believing and God-fearing" <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>), with the names of the patriarch (or Synod) and <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, and the ending; "and all [masc.] and all [fem.]" <em>kai panton kai pason</em>. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> then reads the Diptychs of the Living; more <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for them follow. Here ends the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a>. The celebrant <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesses</a> the people: "The mercy of our great <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> be with all of you." Choir: "And with thy spirit." And the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> goes out to his place before the ikonostasis and reads a <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for various spiritual and temporal favours, to each clause of which the choir answers: "Kyrie eleison", and at the last clause &#151; "Having <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> in the union of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and in the communion of the Holy Ghost, let us commend ourselves and one another and our whole life to Christ, our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." To Thee, O Lord (<em>Soi, Kyrie</em>). &#151; Meanwhile the celebrant says a long <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> silently. The people sing the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>, and the celebrant adds the clause: For Thine is the Kingdom" etc. The Inclination follows. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> says, "Bow your heads to the Lord" (our "Humiliate capita vestra Domino"); they answer, "To Thee, O Lord", and the celebrant says the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> of Inclination (different in the two Liturgies). The preparation for Communion begins here. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> winds his orarion (stole) around his body, the curtain of the royal doors (they have besides the doors a curtain that is continually drawn backward and forward during the Liturgy) is drawn back, and the celebrant elevates the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> saying, "Holy things for the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>", to which the answer is: "One only is holy, one only is Lord, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> in the glory of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>." The Communion <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> (<em>koinonikon</em>) of the day is sung, and the Communion begins. While the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> Communicate in the Sanctuary a sermon is sometimes preached. The celebrant breaks the Holy Bread into four parts, as it is marked, and arranges them on the diskos thus: --

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>N&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K&nbsp;A <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X&nbsp;S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>(<em>Where</em> I=Iota, S=Sigma) </p></blockquote>

<p>He puts the fraction marked <em>(IOTA-SIGMA)</em> into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> again pours into it a little warm water (the use of warm water is a very old peculiarity of this rite).The part marked <em>(CHI-SIGMA)</em> is divided into as many parts as there are <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> to Communicate. Meanwhile, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are said; those about to Communicate ask pardon of their offences against each other. The celebrant says, "Behold I draw near to our <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> King" etc., and receives <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> in the form of bread, saying: The precious and all-holy Body of Our Lord and Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is given to me N. <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> [or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>] for the forgiveness of my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and for life everlasting." Then he says, "Deacon, approach". and gives him Communion with the same form (To thee N. <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> etc.). The celebrant then drinks of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> with a corresponding form &#151; The precious and all-holy Blood &#151; and communicates the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> as before. After Communion each says silently a very beautiful <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> &#151; I believe, Lord, and I confess that Thou art in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> Christ, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of the living God</a> etc. (Brightman, op. cit., 394.) The rest of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are Communicated from the portion marked <em>(IOTA-SIGMA)</em>, that has been put into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and is therefore soaked in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> wine, with one form (The precious and all-holy Body and Blood). The celebrant divides the portions marked <em>NI</em> and <em>KA</em>, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> puts them into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> with a sponge. The doors are opened and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> says, "Draw near in the fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>". The celebrant comes down to the doors with the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and the spoon and communicates the people with the Holy Bread dipped in the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, and with one form, as before. The people stand to receive Communion (the Byzantine Rite knows practically no kneeling at all). Finally, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> puts all the remaining particles into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and carries it back to the prothesis. Those other particles (prosphora) originally cut off from the bread have lain on the diskos (paten) since the proskomide. It has been a great question whether they are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> or not. The Orthodox now say that they are not, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> puts them into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> after the Communion. It is obviously a question of the celebrant's intention. The <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are told to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> them too, and in their Liturgy the people receive in Communion (Fortescue, op. cit., 417; "Echos d'Orient", III, 71-73).
<h3>Dismissal</h3>

<p>Here begins the Dismissal. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> unwinds his orarion, goes back to the choir before the ikonostasis, and says a short <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> again with the choir. He then goes to the prothesis and consumes all that is left of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> with the prosphora. Meanwhile, some of the bread originally cut up at the Prothesis has remained there all the time. This is now brought to the celebrant, blessed by him, and given to the people as a sacramental (the French <em>pain b&eacute;nit</em> &#151; see <a href="../cathen/01562b.htm">ANTIDORON</a>). After some more <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> the celebrant and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> go to the diakonikon, the doors are shut, they take off their vestments, and the Liturgy is over. The whole service is very much longer than our Mass. It lasts about two hours. It should be noted that all the time that the choir are singing or <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a> being said the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is saying other <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> silently (<em>mystikos</em>). The Byzantine Rite has no provision for low <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>. As they say the Liturgy only on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feast-days, they have less need for such a rite. In cases of necessity, where there is no <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, the celebrant supplies his part as best he can. The Uniats, who have begun to celebrate every day, have evolved a kind of low Liturgy; and at the Greek College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> they have a number of little <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> books containing an arrangement for celebrating with a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and one lay server only. But in the Levant, at any rate, the Liturgy is always sung, and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> is always used; so that the minimum of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> required for the Liturgy is a celebrant, server, and one other man who forms the choir.
<h3>Liturgy of the Presanctified</h3>

<p>The Liturgy of the Presanctified is fitted into the general framework of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom's</a> Rite. It is usually celebrated on Wednesdays and Fridays in the first six weeks of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, and on all the days of <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a>, except <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a> and <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Easter Eve</a> which have the real Liturgy (of St. Basil). On other days in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> there is no <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> service at all. On the Sunday before more loaves (<em>prosphorai</em>) are used than otherwise. The same rite of preparation is made over all. After the <a href="../cathen/05380b.htm">Elevation</a> the celebrant dips the other prosphoras into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> with the spoon, and places it in another <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> in the tabernacle (<em>artophorion</em>) kept for this purpose. The Liturgy of the Presanctified is said after <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> (<em>hesperinos</em>), which forms its first part. There is of course no further Proskomide, but the preparatory <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are said by celebrant and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> as usual. The Great Litany is introduced into the middle of <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> <em>phos ilaron</em> (see below) is sung as usual, and the lessons are read. The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> and their dismissal follow. The Great Entrance is made with the already <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> offerings, and a changed form of the Cherubic Hymn is sung (Maltzew, "Die Liturgien", 149). The curtain of the royal doors is half-drawn across, the whole <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> is omitted, and they go on at once to the Short Litany before the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>, Inclination, and <a href="../cathen/05380b.htm">Elevation</a> with the form: "The presanctified Holy Things to the holy" follow. Wine and warm water are poured into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, but not, of course, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. Communion is given with one form only. The <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> already dipped in <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> wine is now dipped in unconsecrated wine. The celebrant drinks of this wine after his Communion without any <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. The Liturgy ends as usual (with different forms in some parts), and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> consumes what is left of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> (unless some of it is again reserved for the next Presanctified Liturgy and the wine in the Chalice. This is the merest outline of the rite. Its earlier part is inextricably joined to the <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> (Maltzew, op. cit., 121-158).
<h3>The Divine Office</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> is very long and complicated. When sung in choir it lasts about eight hours. It is said entirely only by <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. Secular <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> say part of it, as their devotion dictates. The Uniats frequently apply to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what to do, and the answer is always: <em>Servetur consuetudo</em>, by which is meant that their <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> should say as much of the Office as is customary. It is impossible for them to say it all. The Office is divided into the hours named above (under <em>Service-books</em>) which correspond to ours, with additional short hours (<em>mesoora</em>) intermediate between Prime, <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">Terce</a>, Sext, None, and <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>. It is made up of psalms, lessons, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and especially of a great number of <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> in rhythmical prose. The <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> is divided into twenty parts called <em>kathismata</em>, each of which is made up of three sections (<em>staseis</em>). The whole <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> is sung every week. The most important of the many kinds of <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> are the following: A canon (<em>kanon</em>) is made up of nine odes corresponding to the nine canticles (of Moses, <a href="../bible/exo015.htm#vrs1">Exodus 15:1-19</a>; <a href="../bible/deu032.htm#vrs1">Deuteronomy 32:1-43</a>; of Anna, <a href="../bible/1sa002.htm#vrs1">1 Samuel 2:1-10</a>; Habakkuk 3:2-19; <a href="../bible/isa026.htm#vrs9">Isaiah 26:9-20</a>; <a href="../bible/jon002.htm#vrs2">Jonah 2:2-10</a>; the Benedicite, <a href="../cathen/09534a.htm">Magnificat</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02473a.htm">Benedictus</a>) sung at <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a>. Of these canticles the second is sung only in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>; therefore most canons have no second ode. Each <em>ode</em> is supposed to correspond more or less to its canticle. Thus the sixth ode will generally contain a reference to Jona's whale. Otherwise the canon is always about the feast on which it is sung, and much ingenuity is expended in forcing some connexion between the event of the day and the allusions in the canticles. The odes are further divided into a <em>heirmos</em> and <em>troparia</em> of any number, from three to twenty or more. The heirmos sets the tune for each ode (see <a href="../cathen/12144a.htm">PLAIN CHANT</a>), and the troparia follow it. The last troparion of each ode always refers to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> and is called <em>theotokion</em>. The odes often make an <a href="../cathen/01111a.htm">acrostic</a> in their initial letters; sometimes they are <a href="../cathen/01333a.htm">alphabetic</a>. In long canons a poem is intercalated in the middle during which people may sit (they stand for nearly the whole Office); it is called <em>theotokion</em>. Three troparia form an <em>kathisma</em> ("house", cf. <a href="../cathen/08245a.htm">Italian</a> <em>stanza</em>). The canons for the weekdays are in the Oktoechos, those for immovable feasts in the <a href="../cathen/10177b.htm">Menaias</a>, for movable ones in the Triodion and Pentekostarion (see above under <em>Service-books</em>). One of the most famous of all is <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene's</a> Golden Canon for <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Day</a> (translated by Dr. J. M. Neale in his "Hymns of the Eastern Church", 4th ed., London, pp. 30-44). Other kinds of chant are the <em>kontakion</em>, a short poem about the feast, the <em>stichos</em> a versicle, generally from a psalm (like our <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>), which introduces a <em>sticheron</em>, or <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> sung at <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a> and <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>. An <em>idiomelon</em> is a troparion that has its own melody, instead of following a heirmos (for other kinds of chant see <a href="../cathen/11078a.htm">Nilles</a>, "Kalend. Man.", pp. lvii-lxix, and the example he gives from the feast of the Transfiguration, 6 August). The Great Doxology (<em>doxologia</em>) is our "Gloria in excelsis", the small one our "Gloria Patri". The <a href="../cathen/01092c.htm"><em>Hymnos Akathistos</em></a> ("standing <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>") is a complete Office in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> and of her Annunciation. It has all the Hours and is made up of psalms, odes, etc., like other Offices. It is sung very solemnly on the Saturday before the second <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> before <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>; and they sing parts of it every Friday evening and Saturday morning in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>. It is always sung standing. The Hymnos Akathistos is printed at the end of the Horologion. P. de Meester, O.S.B., has edited it with an Italian translation (<em>Akolouthia tou akathistou hymnou</em>. &#151; Officio dell' inno acatisto, Rome, 1903). At the end of <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> every day is sung the famous <em>phos ilaron</em>, as the evening light disappears, and the lamps are lit: --

<blockquote><p>Hail, gladdening Light, of his pure glory poured <br>Who is the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> Father, heavenly, blest, <br>Holiest of Holies, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ, Our Lord</a>. <br>Now we are come to the sun's hour of rest, <br>The lights of evening round us shine, <br>We <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> the Father, Son and Holy Spirit divine, <br>Worthiest art Thou at all times to be sung <br>With undefiled tongue, <br><a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of our God</a>, giver of life alone. <br>Therefore in all the world, thy glories, Lord, they own. <br>-- Keble's translation in the "Hymns, Ancient and Modern", No. 18.</p></blockquote>

<h3>The seven Great Mysteries (sacraments)</h3>

<p>There are, lastly, services for the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Seven Great Mysteries (the Seven Sacraments)</a> that are printed in the <a href="../cathen/05595b.htm">Euchologion</a> after the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> (ed. cit., pp. 136-288).

<h4>Baptism</h4>

<p>Baptism is always conferred by immersion (the Orthodox have grave <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> as to the validity of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by infusion. See Fortescue, Orth. E. Church, p. 420). The child is anointed all over its body and dipped three times with its face towards the east. The form is: "The servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> N. is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the Father, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, and of the Son, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, and of the Holy Ghost, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>."

<h4>Confirmation</h4>

<p>Confirmation follows at once and is conferred by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> recognizes this confirmation as valid and neither rebaptizes nor reconfirms converts from Orthodoxy). The whole body is again anointed with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a> (<em>to hagion hyron</em>) prepared very elaborately with fifty-five various substances by the cumenical patriarch on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a> (Fortescue, op. cit., 425-426). The form is: "The seal of the gift of the Holy Ghost" (Euch., 136-144). The Orthodox never rebaptize when they are sure of the validity of former <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; but they reconfirm continually. Confirmation has become the usual rite of admittance into their Church, even in the case of <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> who have already been confirmed orthodoxly.

<h4>Holy Communion</h4>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Orthodox <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> Communicates as a rule only four times a year, at <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, <a href="../cathen/15614b.htm">Whitsunday</a>, and the Falling Asleep of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> (15 August). The <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is reserved for the sick in the <em>artophorion</em>, (or <em>ierophylakion</em>) under both kinds more or less, that is to say it has been dipped into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and allowed to dry. It is given to the sick with a spoon and with the usual form (see above under <em>Holy Liturgy</em>). They have no tradition of reverence for the reserved Eucharist.

<h4>Penance</h4>

<p>Penance (<em>metanoia</em>) is administered rarely, usually on the same occasions as <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>. They have no confessionals. The ghostly father (<em>pneumatikos</em>) sits before the ikonostasis under the picture of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, the penitent kneels before him (one of the rare cases of kneeling is in this rite), and several <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are said, to which the choir answers "Kyrie eleison". The "choir" is always the penitent himself. Then the ghostly father is directed to say "in a Cheerful voice: Brother, be not ashamed that you come before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and before me, for you do not confess to me but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who is present here." He asks the penitent his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, says that only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can forgive him, but that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> gave this power to his Apostles saying: "Whose sins ye shall forgive", etc., and absolves him with a deprecatory form in a long <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in which occur the words: "May this same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through me a sinner, forgive you all now and for ever." (Euch., pp. 221-223.)

<h4>Holy Order</h4>

<p>Holy Order (<em>cheirotonia</em>) is given by laying on the right hand only. The form is (for <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace of God</a>, that always strengthens the weak and fills the empty, appoints the most religious sub-deacon N. to be <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. Let us then <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him that the grace of the Holy Ghost may come to him." Long <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> follow, with allusions to St. Stephen and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a>; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> vests the new <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, giving him an orarion and a ripidion. For <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> there is the same form, with the obvious variants, "the most religious deacon N. to be priest", or "the most religious elect N. to be <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of the holy Metropolis N." (nearly all their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have the title <em>Metropolitan</em>), and the subjects receive their vestments and instruments. Priests and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> concelebrate at once with the ordainer (Euch., 160-181). The Orthodox believe that the grace of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> may perish through <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, so they generally reordain converts (the Russian Church has officially refused to do this, Fortescue, op. cit., 423-424).

<h4>Matrimony</h4>

<p>Matrimony (<em>gamos</em>) is often called the "crowning" (<em>stephanoma</em>) from the practice of crowning the spouses (Euch., 238-252). They wear these crowns for a week, and have a special service for taking them off again (Euch., 252).

<h4>The Anointing of the Sick</h4>

<p>The Anointing of the Sick (<em>euchelaion</em>) is administered (when possible) by seven <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The oil contains as a rule wine, in memory of the Good <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>. It is blessed by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> just before it is used. They use a very long form invoking the all-holy Theotokos, the "moneyless physicians" Sts. Cosmas and Damian, and other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. They anoint the forehead, chin, cheeks, hands, nostrils, and breast with a brush. Each <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> present does the same (Euch., 260-288). The service is, as usual, very long. They anoint people who are only slightly ill, (they very much resent our name: <em>Extreme</em> Unction), and in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a> the Metropolitans of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> and Novgorod anoint everyone who presents himself, as a preparation for <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> (Echos d'Orient, II, 193-203).
<h3>Sacramentals</h3>

<p>There are many Sacramentals. People are sometimes anointed with the oil taken from a lamp that burns before a holy icon (occasionally with the form for confirmation: "The seal of the gift of the Holy Ghost"). They have besides the antidoron another kind of blessed bread &#151; the <em>kolyba</em> eaten in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of some saint or in memory of the dead. On the Epiphany ("The Holy Lights" &#151; <em>ta hagia phota</em>) there is a solemn blessing of the waters. They have a great number of <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcisms</a>, very stern <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> (involving abstinence from many things besides flesh meat), and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> for all manner of things. These are to be found in the Euchologion. Preaching was till lately almost a lost art in the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>; now a revival of it has begun (Gelzer, Geistliches u. Weltliches, etc., 76-82). There is a long funeral service (Euch., ed. cit., 393-470). For all these rites (except the Liturgy) a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> does not wear all his vestments but (over his cassock) the epitrachelion and phainolion. The high black hat without a brim (<em>kalemeukion</em>) worn by all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of this rite is well known. It is worn with vestments as well as in ordinary life. Bishops and dignitaries have a black veil over it. All clerks wear long hair and a <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a>. For a more detailed account of all these rites see "Orth. Eastern Church", pp. 418-428.
