<h1>The Roman Rite</h1>  

<p>(<em>Ritus romanus</em>).

<p>The Roman Rite is the manner of celebrating the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>, administering <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacraments</a>, reciting the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, and performing other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions (blessings, all kinds of <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">Sacramentals</a>, etc.) as used in the city and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>The Roman Rite is the most wide-spread in <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. That it has advantages possessed by no other &#151; the most archaic antiquity, unequalled dignity, beauty, and the practical convenience of being comparatively short in its services &#151; will not be denied by any one who knows it and the other ancient <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>. But it was not the consideration of these advantages that led to its extensive use; it was the exalted position of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">see</a> that used it. The Roman Rite was adopted throughout the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a> because the local <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, sometimes kings or emperors, felt that they could not do better than use the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">chief bishop of all</a>, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. And this imitation of Roman <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> practice brought about in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a> the application of the principle (long admitted in the East) that <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> should follow <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>.

<p>Apart from his universal <a href="../cathen/12423a.htm">primacy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had always been unquestioned <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a>. It was then the right and normal thing that the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a> should use his <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a>. The irregular and anomalous incident of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> history is not that the Roman Rite has been used, practically exclusively, in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a> since about the tenth or eleventh century, but that before that there were other <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. Not the disappearance but the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and long toleration of the Gallican and Spanish <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> is the difficulty (see <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">RITES</a>).

<p>Like all others, the Roman Rite bears clear marks of its local origin. Wherever it may be used, it is still Roman in the local sense, obviously composed for use in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Our <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> marks the Roman stations, contains the Roman <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in the Canon (See <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">CANON OF THE MASS</a>), <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honours</a> with special <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> the Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. Our <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feasts</a> are constantly anniversaries of local Roman events, of the <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedication</a> of Roman churches (All Saints, <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">St. Michael</a>, S. Maria ad Nives, etc.). The <a href="../cathen/04103a.htm">Collect</a> for Sts. Peter and Paul (29 June) supposes that it is said at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which "received the beginnings of her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>" from these <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is that of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>), and so on continually. This is quite right and fitting; it agrees with all <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> history. No <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> has ever been composed consciously for general use. In the East there are still stronger examples of the same thing. The Orthodox all over the world use a <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> full of local allusions to the city of Constantinople.

<p>The Roman Rite evolved out of the (presumed) universal, but quite fluid, <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> of the first three centuries during the (liturgically) almost unknown <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> from the fourth to the sixth. In the sixth we have it fully developed in the Leonine, later in the Gelasian, Sacramentaries. How and exactly when the specifically Roman qualities were formed during that <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> will, no doubt, always be a matter of conjecture (see <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">LITURGY</a>; <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">LITURGY OF THE MASS</a>). At first its use was very restrained. It was followed only in the Roman <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">province</a>. North <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was Gallican, the South, Byzantine, but <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> was always closely akin to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> liturgically.

<p>From the eighth century gradually the Roman usage began its career of conquest in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a>. By the twelfth century at latest it was used wherever Latin obtained, having displaced all others except at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and in retreating parts of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. That has been its position ever since. As the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> it is used exclusively in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarchate</a>, with three small exceptions at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, Toledo, and in the still Byzantine churches of Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>.

<p>During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> it developed into a vast number of derived <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, differing from the pure form only in unimportant details and in exuberant additions. Most of these were abolished by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> in 1570 (see <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">LITURGY OF THE MASS</a>). Meanwhile, the Roman Rite had itself been affected by, and had received additions from, the Gallican and Spanish uses it displaced. The Roman Rite is now used by every one who is subject to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> patriarchal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> (with the three exceptions noted above); that is, it is used in Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, including <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, in all countries colonized from Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>: America, <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>, etc., by Western (<a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a>) missionaries all over the world, including the <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Eastern</a> lands where other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> also obtain.

<p>No one may change his <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> without a legal authorization, which is not easily obtained. So the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and so on uses his own Roman Rite, just as at home. On the same principle <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Eastern rites in Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, America, etc., keep their <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>; so that <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> now cross each other wherever such people live together. The language of the Roman Rite is Latin everywhere except that in some churches along the Western Adriatic coast it is said in <a href="../cathen/14041b.htm">Slavonic</a> and on rare occasions in Greek at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (see <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">RITES</a>). In derived forms the Roman Rite is used in some few <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> (Lyons) and by several <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders (<a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>). In these their fundamentally Roman <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> is expressed by a compound name. They are the "Ritus Romano-Lugdunensis", "Romano-monasticus", and so on.
