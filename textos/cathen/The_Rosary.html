<h2 id="section1">In the Western Church</h2>

<p>"The Rosary", says the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Roman Breviary</a>, "is a certain form of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> wherein we say fifteen decades or tens of <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Hail Marys</a> with an <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Our Father</a> between each ten, while at each of these fifteen decades we recall successively in pious meditation one of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of our <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a>." The same lesson for the <a href="../cathen/13189a.htm">Feast of the Holy Rosary</a> informs us that when the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensian heresy</a> was devastating the country of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> earnestly besought the help of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> and was instructed by her, so tradition asserts, to preach the Rosary among the people as an antidote to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. From that time forward this manner of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was "most wonderfully published abroad and developed [<em>promulgari augerique coepit</em>] by <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> whom different <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Supreme Pontiffs</a> have in various past ages of their <a href="../cathen/01640a.htm">apostolic letters</a> declared to be the institutor and author of the same <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a>." That many <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> have so spoken is undoubtedly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and amongst the rest we have a series of <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">encyclicals</a>, beginning in 1883, issued by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a>, which, while commending this <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> in the most earnest terms, assumes the institution of the Rosary by <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> to be a fact <a href="../cathen/07635a.htm">historically</a> established. Of the remarkable fruits of this <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a> and of the extraordinary favours which have been granted to the world, as is piously <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, through this means, something will be said under the headings <a href="../cathen/13189a.htm">F<font size=-2>EAST OF THE ROSARY</font></a> and <a href="../cathen/13188b.htm">C<font size=-2>ONFRATERNITIES OF THE ROSARY</font></a>. We will confine ourselves here to the controverted question of its <a href="../cathen/07635a.htm">history</a>, a matter which both in the middle of the eighteenth century and again in recent years has attracted much attention.

<p>Let us begin with certain facts which will not be contested. It is tolerably obvious that whenever any <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> has to be repeated a large number of times recourse is likely to be had to some mechanical apparatus less troublesome than counting upon the fingers. In almost all countries, then, we meet with something in the nature of prayer-counters or <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">rosary beads</a>. Even in ancient Nineveh a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> has been found thus described by Lavard in his "Monuments" (I, plate 7): "Two winged <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a> standing before the sacred tree in the attitude of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; they lift the extended right hand and hold in the left a garland or rosary." However this may be, it is certain that among the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> the <em>Tasbih</em> or bead-string, consisting of 33, 66, or 99 <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a>, and used for counting devotionally the names of <a href="../cathen/01316a.htm">Allah</a>, has been in use for many centuries. Marco Polo, visiting the King of <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a> in the thirteenth century, found to his surprise that that monarch employed a rosary of 104 (? 108) precious stones to count his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> and his companions were equally astonished to see that rosaries were universally familiar to the <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhists</a> of <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. Among the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> we hear of the <em>kombologion</em>, or <em>komboschoinion</em>, a cord with a hundred knots used to count <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">genuflexions</a> and <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">signs of the cross</a>. Similarly, beside the mummy of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a>, <a href="../cathen/14553d.htm">Thaias</a>, of the fourth century, recently disinterred at <a href="../cathen/01564a.htm">Antin&ouml;e</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, was found a sort of cribbage-board with holes, which has generally been thought to be an apparatus for counting <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a> and other ancient authorities have left us an account. A certain <a href="../cathen/11590b.htm">Paul the Hermit</a>, in the fourth century, had imposed upon himself the task of repeating three hundred <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, according to a set form, every day. To do this, he gathered up three hundred pebbles and threw one away as each <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was finished (<a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a>, <em>Hist. Laus.</em>, xx; Butler, II, 63). It is probable that other <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetics</a> who also numbered their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> by hundreds adopted some similar expedient. (Cf. "Vita S. Godrici", cviii.) Indeed when we find a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a> addressed to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/01616a.htm">St. Apollinaris</a> in Classe requiring them, in gratitude for the <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">pope's</a> benefactions, to say <a href="../cathen/08714a.htm"><em>Kyrie eleison</em></a> three hundred times twice a day (see the <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a> of <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Hadrian I</a>, A.D. 782, in Jaffe-L&ouml;wenfeld, n. 2437), one would infer that some counting apparatus must almost necessarily have been used for the purpose.

<p>But there were other <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to be counted more nearly connected with the Rosary than <a href="../cathen/08714a.htm">Kyrie eleisons</a>. At an early date among the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic orders</a> the practice had established itself not only of offering <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Masses</a>, but of saying vocal <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> as a suffrage for their deceased brethren. For this purpose the private recitation of the 150 <a href="../cathen/12553a.htm">psalms</a>, or of 50 <a href="../cathen/12553a.htm">psalms</a>, the third part, was constantly enjoined. Already in A.D. 800 we learn from the compact between <a href="../cathen/13349a.htm">St. Gall</a> and <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> ("Mon. Germ. Hist.: Confrat.", Piper, 140) that for each deceased brother all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should say one <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> and also fifty <a href="../cathen/12553a.htm">psalms</a>. A charter in Kemble (Cod. Dipl., I, 290) prescribes that each <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> is to sing two fifties (<em>twa fiftig</em>) for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of certain benefactors, while each <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is to sing two <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Masses</a> and each <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> to read two <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">Passions</a>. But as time went on, and the <a href="../cathen/04346b.htm"><em>conversi</em></a>, or <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, most of them quite illiterate, became distinct from the choir <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, it was felt that they also should be required to substitute some simple form of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in place of the <a href="../cathen/12553a.htm">psalms</a> to which their more <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> brethren were bound by rule. Thus we read in the "Ancient Customs of Cluny", collected by Udalrio in 1096, that when the death of any brother at a distance was announced, every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was to offer <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>, and every non-priest was either to say fifty <a href="../cathen/12553a.htm">psalms</a> or to repeat fifty times the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Paternoster</a> ("quicunque sacerdos est cantet missam pro eo, et qui non est sacerdos quinquaginta psalmos aut toties orationem dominicam", P.L., CXLIX, 776). Similarly among the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Knights Templar</a>, whose rule dates from about 1128, the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> who could not attend choir were required to say the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> 57 times in all and on the death of any of the brethren they had to say the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Pater Noster</a> a hundred times a day for a week.

<p>To count these accurately there is every reason to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that already in the eleventh and twelfth centuries a practice had come in of using pebbles, berries, or discs of bone threaded on a string. It is in any case certain that the Countess Godiva of Coventry (c. 1075) left by will to the statue of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> in a certain <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> "the circlet of precious stones which she had threaded on a cord in order that by fingering them one after another she might count her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> exactly" (Malmesbury, "Gesta Pont.", Rolls Series 311). Another example seems to occur in the case of <a href="../cathen/13184a.htm">St. Rosalia</a> (A.D. 1160), in whose <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> similar strings of <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a> were discovered. Even more important is the fact that such strings of <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a> were known throughout the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> &#151; and in some <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Continental</a> tongues are known to this day &#151; as "Paternosters". The evidence for this is overwhelming and comes from every part of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Already in the thirteenth century the manufacturers of these articles, who were known as "paternosterers", almost everywhere formed a recognized <a href="../cathen/07066c.htm">craft guild</a> of considerable importance. The "Livre des m&eacute;tiers" of Stephen Boyleau, for example, supplies full information regarding the four <a href="../cathen/07066c.htm">guilds</a> of <em>paten&ocirc;triers</em> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in the year 1268, while Paternoster Row in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> still preserves the memory of the street in which their <a href="../cathen/05431b.htm">English</a> craft-fellows congregated. Now the obvious inference is that an appliance which was persistently called a "Paternoster", or in <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>fila de paternoster, numeralia de paternoster</em>, and so on, had, at least originally, been designed for counting <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Our Fathers</a>. This inference, drawn out and illustrated with much learning by Father T. Esser, O.P., in 1897, becomes a practical certainty when we remember that it was only in the middle of the twelfth century that the <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Hail Mary</a> came at all generally into use as a formula of <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a>. It is morally impossible that Lady Godiva's circlet of jewels could have been intended to count <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Ave Marias</a>. Hence there can be no doubt that the strings of <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">prayerbeads</a> were called "paternosters" because for a long time they were principally employed to number repetitions of the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>.

<p>When, however, the <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Hail Mary</a> came into use, it appears that from the first the <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">consciousness</a> that it was in its own nature a salutation rather than a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> induced a fashion of repeating it many times in succession, accompanied by <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">genuflexions</a> or some other external <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of reverence. Just as happens nowadays in the firing of salutes, or in the applause given to a public performer, or in the rounds of cheers evoked among school-boys by an arrival or departure, so also then the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> paid by such salutations was measured by numbers and continuance. Further, since the recitation of the <a href="../cathen/12553a.htm">Psalms</a> divided into fifties was, as innumerable documents attest, the favourite form of <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a> for religious and learned persons, so those who were simple or much occupied <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a>, by the repetition of fifty, a hundred, or a hundred and fifty were salutations of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>, to feel that they were imitating the practice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> more exalted <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">servants</a>. In any case it is certain that in the course of the twelfth century and before the birth of <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a>, the practice of reciting 50 or 150 <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Ave Marias</a> had become generally familiar. The most conclusive evidence of this is furnished by the "Mary-legends", or stories of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>, which obtained wide circulation at this epoch. The story of Eulalia, in particular, according to which a client of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> who had been wont to say a hundred and fifty <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Aves</a> was bidden by her to say only fifty, but more slowly, has been shown by Mussafia (Marien-legenden, Pts I, ii) to be unquestionably of early date. Not less conclusive is the account given of <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">St. Albert</a> (d. 1140) by his contemporary biographer, who tells us: "A hundred times a day he <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">bent his knees</a>, and fifty times he prostrated himself raising his body again by his fingers and toes, while he repeated at every <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">genuflexion</a>: 'Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou amongst <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and blessed is the fruit of thy womb'." This was the whole of the <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Hail Mary</a> as then said, and the fact of all the words being set down rather implies that the formula had not yet become universally familiar. Not less remarkable is the account of a similar <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotional exercise</a> occurring in the Corpus Christi <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01464a.htm">Ancren Riwle</a>. This text, declared by K&ouml;lbing to have been written in the middle of the twelfth century (Englische Studien, 1885, P. 116), can in any case be hardly later than 1200. The passage in question gives directions how fifty <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Aves</a> are to be said divided into sets of ten, with prostrations and other marks of reverence. (See The Month, July, 1903.) When we find such an exercise recommended to a little group of <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a> in a corner of <a href="../cathen/05431b.htm">England</a>, twenty years before any <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">Dominican</a> foundation was made in this country, it seems difficult to resist the conclusion that the custom of reciting fifty or a hundred and fifty <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Aves</a> had grown familiar, independently of, and earlier than, the preaching of <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a>. On the other hand, the practice of meditating on certain definite <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, which has been rightly described as the very essence of the Rosary <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a>, seems to have only arisen long after the date of <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic's</a> death. It is difficult to prove a negative, but Father T. Esser, O.P., has shown (in the periodical "Der Katholik", of Mainz, Oct., Nov., Dec., 1897) that the introduction of this meditation during the recitation of the <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Aves</a> was rightly attributed to a certain <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a>, <a href="../cathen/05112b.htm">Dominic the Prussian</a>. It is in any case certain that at the close of the fifteenth century the utmost possible variety of methods of meditating prevailed, and that the fifteen <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> now generally accepted were not uniformly adhered to even by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> themselves. (See Schmitz, "Rosenkranzgebet", p. 74; Esser in "Der Katholik for 1904-6.) To sum up, we have positive evidence that both the invention of the <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a> as a counting apparatus and also the practice of repeating a hundred and fifty <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Aves</a> cannot be due to <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a>, because they are both notably older than his time. Further, we are assured that the meditating upon the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> was not introduced until two hundred years after his death. What then, we are compelled to ask, is there left of which <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> may be called the author?


<p>These positive reasons for distrusting the current tradition might in a measure be ignored as <a href="../cathen/03705a.htm">archaeological</a> refinements, if there were any satisfactory evidence to show that <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> had identified himself with the pre-existing Rosary and become its apostle. But here we are met with absolute silence. Of the eight or nine early Lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, not one makes the faintest allusion to the Rosary. The witnesses who gave evidence in the cause of his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> are equally reticent. In the great collection of documents accumulated by Fathers Balme and Lelaidier, O.P., in their "Cartulaire de St. Dominique" the question is studiously ignored. The early constitutions of the different provinces of the order have been examined, and many of them printed, but no one has found any reference to this <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a>. We possess hundreds, even thousands, of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> containing devotional treatises, sermons, chronicles, Saints' lives, etc., written by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Friars Preachers</a> between 1220 and 1450; but no single verifiable passage has yet been produced which speaks of the Rosary as instituted by <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> or which even makes much of the <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a> as one specially dear to his children. The charters and other deeds of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> for men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, as M. Jean Guiraud points out with emphasis in his edition of the Cartulaire of La Prouille (I, cccxxviii), are equally silent. Neither do we find any suggestion of a connection between <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> and the Rosary in the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> of these two and a half centuries. Even the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> at Bologna and the numberless frescoes by <a href="../cathen/01483b.htm">Fra Angelico</a> representing the brethren of his order ignore the Rosary completely.

<p>Impressed by this conspiracy of silence, the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>, on trying to trace to its source the origin of the current tradition, found that all the clues converged upon one point, the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/01246a.htm">Alan de Rupe</a> about the years 1470-75. He it undoubtedly was who first suggested the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a> of "Our Lady's Psalter" (a hundred and fifty <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Hail Marys</a>) was instituted or revived by <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a>. <a href="../cathen/01246a.htm">Alan</a> was a very earnest and devout <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but, as the highest authorities admit, he was full of delusions, and based his revelations on the imaginary testimony of writers that never existed (see Qu&eacute;tif and <a href="../cathen/05270a.htm">Echard</a>, "Scriptores O.P.", 1, 849). His preaching, however, was attended with much success. The <a href="../cathen/13188b.htm">Rosary Confraternities</a>, organized by him and his colleagues at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and elsewhere had great vogue, and led to the printing of many books, all more or less impregnated with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of <a href="../cathen/01246a.htm">Alan</a>. <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a> were granted for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work that was thus being done and the documents conceding these <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> accepted and repeated, as was natural in that uncritical age, the <a href="../cathen/07635a.htm">historical</a> data which had been inspired by <a href="../cathen/01246a.htm">Alan's</a> writings and which were submitted according to the usual practice by the promoters of the <a href="../cathen/13188b.htm">confraternities</a> themselves. It was in this way that the tradition of <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">Dominican</a> authorship grew up. The first <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> speak of this authorship with some reserve: "Prout in historiis legitur" says <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> in the earliest of all. "Pastoris aeterni" 1520; but many of the later <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> were less guarded.

<p>Two considerations strongly support the view of the Rosary tradition just expounded. The first is the gradual surrender of almost every notable piece that has at one time or another been relied upon to vindicate the supposed claims of <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a>. <a href="../cathen/15001b.htm">Touron</a> and <a href="../cathen/03090a.htm">Alban Butler</a> appealed to the Memoirs of a certain Luminosi de Aposa who professed to have heard <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> preach at Bologna, but these Memoirs have long ago been proved to a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>. Danzas, Von L&ouml;e and others attached much importance to a fresco at Muret; but the fresco is not now in existence, and there is good reason for <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that the rosary once seen in that fresco was painted in at a later date ("The Month" Feb. 1901, p. 179). <a href="../cathen/09578a.htm">Mamachi</a>, Esser, Walsh, and Von L&ouml;e and others quote some alleged contemporary verses about <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">Dominic</a> in connection with a crown of roses; the original <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> has disappeared, and it is certain that the writers named have printed <em>Dominicus</em> where Benoist, the only person who has seen the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, read <em>Dominus</em>. The famous will of Anthony Sers, which professed to leave a bequest to the <a href="../cathen/13188b.htm">Confraternity of the Rosary</a> at <a href="../cathen/11417c.htm">Palencia</a> in 1221, was put forward as a conclusive piece of testimony by <a href="../cathen/09578a.htm">Mamachi</a>; but it is now admitted by <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> authorities to be a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> ("The Irish Rosary, Jan., 1901, p. 92). Similarly, a supposed reference to the subject by <a href="../cathen/14661a.htm">Thomas &agrave; Kempis</a> in the "Chronicle of Mount St. Agnes" is a pure blunder ("The Month", Feb., 1901, p. 187). With this may be noted the change in tone observable of late in authoritative works of reference. In the "Kirchliches Handlexikon" of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> and in the last edition of <a href="../cathen/07251c.htm">Herder's</a> "Konversationslexikon" no attempt is made to defend the tradition which connects <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> personally with the origin of the Rosary. Another consideration which cannot be developed is the multitude of conflicting legends concerning the origin of this <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a> of "Our Lady's Psalter" which prevailed down to the end of the fifteenth century, as well as the early diversity of practice in the manner of its recitation. These facts agree ill with the supposition that it took its rise in a definite <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">revelation</a> and was jealously watched over from the beginning by one of the most learned and influential of the religious orders. No doubt can exist that the immense diffusion of the Rosary and its <a href="../cathen/13188b.htm">confraternities</a> in modern times and the vast influence it has exercised for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> are mainly due to the labours and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the sons of <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/07635a.htm">historical</a> evidence serves plainly to show that their interest in the subject was only awakened in the last years of the fifteenth century.

<p>That the Rosary is pre-eminently the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the people adapted alike for the use of simple and learned is proved not only by the long series of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> utterances by which it has been commended to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> but by the daily experience of all who are familiar with it. The objection so often made against its "vain repetitions" is felt by none but those who have failed to realize how entirely the spirit of the exercise lies in the meditation upon the fundamental <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. To the initiated the words of the <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">angelical salutation</a> form only a sort of half-conscious accompaniment, a bourdon which we may liken to the "Holy, Holy, Holy" of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">heavenly choirs</a> and surely not in itself meaningless. Neither can it be necessary to urge that the freest criticism of the <a href="../cathen/07635a.htm">historical</a> origin of the <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a>, which involves no point of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, is compatible with a full appreciation of the <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotional</a> treasures which this pious exercise brings within the reach of all.

<p>As regards the origin of the name, the word <em>rosarius</em> means a garland or bouquet of roses, and it was not unfrequently used in a figurative sense &#151; e.g. as the title of a book, to denote an anthology or collection of extracts. An early legend which after travelling all over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> penetrated even to <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a> connected this name with a story of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>, who was seen to take rosebuds from the lips of a young <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> when he was reciting <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Hail Marys</a> and to weave them into a garland which she placed upon her head. A <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German</a> metrical version of this story is still extant dating from the thirteenth century. The name "Our Lady's Psalter" can also be traced back to the same period. <em>Corona</em> or <em>chaplet</em> suggests the same <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> as <em>rosarium</em>. The old <a href="../cathen/05458a.htm">English</a> name found in <a href="../cathen/03642b.htm">Chaucer</a> and elsewhere was a "pair of <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a>", in which the word <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm"><em>bead</em></a> originally meant <em><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a></em>.
<h2 id="section2">In the Greek Church, Catholic and schismatic</h2>

<p>The custom of reciting <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> upon a string with knots or <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a> thereon at regular intervals has come down from the early days of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and is still practised in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern</a> as well as in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>. It seems to have originated among the early <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> who used a piece of heavy cord with knots tied at intervals upon which they recited their shorter <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. This form of rosary is still used among the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in the various <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Churches</a>, although <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrites</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> use a very ornamental form of rosary with costly <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a>. The rosary is conferred upon the <a href="../cathen/10467a.htm">Greek monk</a> as a part of his investiture with the <em>mandyas</em> or full <a href="../cathen/10467a.htm">monastic</a> habit, as the second step in the <a href="../cathen/10467a.htm">monastic</a> life, and is called his "spiritual sword". This <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental</a> form of rosary is known in the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Hellenic Greek Church</a> as <em>kombologion</em> (chaplet), or <em>komboschoinion</em> (string of knots or <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a>), in the <a href="../cathen/13253a.htm">Russian Church</a> as <em>vervitza</em> (string), <em>chotki</em> (chaplet), or <em>liestovka</em> (ladder), and in the <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumanian</a> Church as <em>matanie</em> (reverence). The first use of the rosary in any general way was among the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10467a.htm">Orient</a>. Our everyday name of <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">"beads"</a> for it is simply the Old Saxon word <em>bede</em> (a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>) which has been transferred to the instrument used in reciting the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, while the word <em>rosary</em> is an equally modern term. The intercourse of the Western peoples of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> with those of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Rite</a> at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> caused the practice of saying <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> upon knots or <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a> to become widely diffused among the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastic houses</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, although the practice had been observed in some instances before that date. On the other hand, the recitation of the Rosary, as practised in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a>, has not become general in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a>; there it has still retained its original form as a <a href="../cathen/10467a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">exercise of devotion</a>, and is but little known or used among the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, while even the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> seldom use it in their <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotions</a>. <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishops</a>, however, retain the rosary, as indicating that they have risen from the <a href="../cathen/10467a.htm">monastic</a> state, even though they are in the world governing their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>.

<p>The rosary used in the present <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Greek Orthodox Church</a> &#151; whether in <a href="../cathen/13253a.htm">Russia</a> or in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">East</a> &#151; is quite different in form from that used in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>. The use of the prayer-knots or <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">prayer-beads</a> originated from the fact that <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/02322a.htm">rule of St. Basil</a>, the only <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> rule known to the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, were enjoined by their founder to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> without ceasing" (<a href="../bible/1th005.htm#vrs17">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>; <a href="../bible/luk001.htm">Luke 1</a>), and as most of the early <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, engaged often in various forms of work and in many cases without sufficient <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> to read the prescribed <a href="../cathen/09193a.htm">lessons</a>, <a href="../cathen/12553a.htm">psalms</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">daily office</a>, the rosary was used by them as a means of continually reciting their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. At the beginning and at the end of each <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> said by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> upon each knot or <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">bead</a> he makes the "great reverence" (<em>he megale metanoia</em>), bending down to the ground, so that the recitation of the rosary is often known as a <em>metania</em>. The rosary used among the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greeks</a> of <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkey</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">East</a> usually consists of one hundred <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a> without any distinction of great or little ones, while the Old Slavic, or <a href="../cathen/13253a.htm">Russian</a>, rosary, generally consists of 103 <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a>, separated in irregular sections by four large <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a>, so that the first large <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">bead</a> is followed by 17 small ones, the second large <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">bead</a> by 33 small ones, the third by 40 small ones, and the fourth by 12 small ones, with an additional one added at the end. The two ends of a <a href="../cathen/13253a.htm">Russian</a> rosary are often bound together for a short distance, so that the lines of <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a> run parallel (hence the name <em>ladder</em> used for the rosary), and they finish with a three-cornered ornament often adorned with a tassel or other finial, corresponding to the <a href="../cathen/04533a.htm">cross</a> or <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medal</a> used in a <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> rosary.

<p>The use of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek</a> rosary is prescribed in Rule 87 of the "Nomocanon", which reads: "The rosary should have one hundred [the <a href="../cathen/13253a.htm">Russian</a> rule says 103] <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a>; and upon each <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">bead</a> the prescribed <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> should be recited." The usual form of this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> prescribed for the rosary runs as follows: "O <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> and <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">living God</a>, through the <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercessions</a> of thy <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">immaculate Mother</a> [<em>tes panachrantou sou Metros</em>] and of all thy <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">Saints</a>, have mercy and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">save</a> us. If, however, the rosary be said as a <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penitential</a> exercise, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> then is: O <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, have mercy on me a sinner. The <a href="../cathen/13253a.htm">Russian</a> rosary is divided by the four large <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a> so as to represent the different parts of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">canonical Office</a> which the recitation of the rosary replaces, while the four large <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a> themselves represent the four <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Mount Athos</a>, where the severest rule is observed, from eighty to a hundred rosaries are said daily by each <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. In <a href="../cathen/13253a.htm">Russian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> the rosary is usually said five times a day, while in the recitation of it the "great reverences" are reduced to ten, the remainder being simply sixty "little reverences" (bowing of the head no further than the waist) and sixty recitations of the <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penitential</a> form of the prescribed <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> Uniats rosary is but little used by the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian monks</a> make use of it in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern</a> style just described and in many cases use it in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Roman</a> fashion in some <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. The more active life prescribed for them in following the example of <a href="../cathen/10472a.htm">Latin monks</a> leaves less time for the recitation of the rosary according to the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern</a> form, whilst the reading and recitation of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a> during the <a href="../cathen/07500b.htm">canonical Hours</a> fulfils the original <a href="../cathen/10467a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> and so does not require the rosary. Latterly the <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08206a.htm">Italo-Greeks</a> have in many places adopted among their <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> a form of to the one used among the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, but its use is far from general. The <a href="../cathen/13277a.htm">Ruthenian</a> and <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumanian</a> Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> do not use it among the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, but reserve it chiefly for the <a href="../cathen/10467a.htm">monastic</a> clergy, although lately in some parts of Galicia its lay use has been occasionally introduced and is regarded as a latinizing practice. It may be said that among the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greeks</a> in general the use of the rosary is regarded as a religious exercise peculiar to the <a href="../cathen/10467a.htm">monastic</a> life; and wherever among <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> Uniats its lay use has been introduced, it is an imitation of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Roman</a> practice. On this account it has never been popularized among the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> of the peoples, who remain strongly attached to their venerable <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Rite</a>.
