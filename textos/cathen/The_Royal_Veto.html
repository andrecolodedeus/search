<h1>The Royal Veto</h1>  

<p>(In the appointment of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishops</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.)

<p>Although the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> enacted against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> were still on the statute book towards the close of the eighteenth century, they were less strictly administered than before. Several causes helped to bring this about. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> formed the vast majority of the population of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Their sympathies were thought to be with the French whom <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> had at that time cause to fear. The <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> had utterly failed of their purpose, and the Government hoped to reach that purpose by other means. The authority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the influence of both on the people, was great; and the Government thought if it could direct or control the influence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> it would secure the allegiance of the people. It hoped thus to fetter the action of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The Government saw an opportunity when the College of Maynooth was about to be founded. The <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were asked if they would agree that the president or professors of the proposed college be appointed by Government; if they would consent that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> be appointed by the king; and how they would advise the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> if such a proposal about the appointment of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were laid before him. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> on 17 Feb., 1795, rejected the first and second proposals categorically. To the third they answered that they would advise the people "not to agree to his Majesty's <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> if it could be avoided; in unavoidable, the king to nominate one of three to be recommended by the Provincial <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>".

<p>In connection with the Union, Pitt intended to bring in a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Relief Bill, or at least he so pretended; and he sought for such security of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> loyalty as might allay the prejudices which he should have to encounter in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. He commissioned Lord Castlereagh to make such arrangements as would satisfy the king that no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> whose loyalty the king should have reason to suspect would be appointed to an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. Ten <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, trustees of <a href="../cathen/10087b.htm">Maynooth College</a>, met on 17 Jan., 1799, to transact college business. Castlereagh submitted his views to them, reminding them of the suspicion of disloyalty under which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> lay since the insurrection of the year before. The ten <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> embodied their reply in certain resolutions, of which this was one: "That in the appointment of the Prelates of the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic Religion</a> to vacant sees within the kingdom, such interference of government as may enable it to be satisfied of the loyalty of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> appointed, is just, and ought to be agreed to." And as a way towards that security, they expressed the opinion that the name of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> chosen to be submitted to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> might be transmitted to the Government, but that the Government should declare within a month whether there was any cause to suspect his loyalty. They did not leave to the Government to decide the reasonableness of such suspicion, for they said "if government have any proper objection against such candidate". Moreover they laid it down that no security given must in the working out "infringe the discipline of the Roman Catholic Church, or diminish the religious influence which the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">Prelates</a> of the Church ought justly to possess over their respective flocks", and that any agreement made "can have no effect without the sanction of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>".

<p>Those were not resolutions of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> episcopate, but simply the opinion of ten <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had met to transact business of another kind; they were driven against their wish to give an opinion. On 15 June, 1799, <a href="../cathen/02685a.htm">Cardinal Borgia</a>, prefect of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, having heard a report that Dr. Troy, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, was leader of a party which was disposed to compromise the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> by assenting to some plan about church discipline, wrote to him asking him for the facts. On 17 Aug., 1799, Dr. Troy replied to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> declaring it was quite <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> that any plan had been arranged, and having given an account of the meeting and resolutions of the Maynooth trustees he adds: "As to the proposal itself, the Prelates were anxious to set aside or elude it; but being unable to do so, they determined to have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> secured." In the spring of 1800, Dr. Troy, writing on the same topic to his agent at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Father Concannon, says: "We all wish to remain as we are; and we would so, were it not that too many of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were active in the wicked rebellion, or did not oppose it. If the Prelates had refused to consider the proposal, they would be accused of a design to exercise an influence over the people, independent of government, for seditious purposes. Nothing but the well grounded apprehension of such a charge, though groundless in itself, would have induced the Prelates to consider the proposal in any manner. . .If we had rejected the proposal <em>in toto</em> we would be considered as rebels. This is a fact. If we agreed to it without reference to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> we would be branded as schismatics. We were between Scylla and Charybdis." The opinion thus expressed by those ten <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in Jan., 1799, was never published by them. It was not meant for publication; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> never took official cognizance of it except to discard it. Every pronouncement of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from that time forward rejected absolutely any proposal which would allow the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government to meddle in appointments to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>.

<p>In 1805 Fox and Lord Grenville presented to Parliament a petition to relieve the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from their civil disabilities. In the debate which followed, Sir John Hippisley spoke in a general way of securities for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> loyalty. That was the first time any such proposal was made in public; but nothing definite was proposed. On 25 May, 1808, Grattan, in moving for a parliamentary committee to consider the claims of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, said he was authorized by them to propose "that no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> be appointed without the entire <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of His Majesty". On 27 May May, Lord Grenville presented a petition for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the Lords, and, in moving for a committee, proposed an effective veto for the king on the appointment of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. What is known as the "veto" thus assumed a definite form as a public question in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. How did the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> meet it? <a href="../cathen/10315a.htm">Dr. Milner</a> tells us in his "Supplementary Memoirs of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>" that "both in conversation and in correspondence they universally disavowed" what had been said by the promoters of the bill on the subject of the veto; and on 14 September they met and officially protested against the veto. In 1810 Grattan gave notice that he would again bring the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> claims before Parliament. On 1 Feb. the English <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Board held a meeting in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> at which a series of resolutions were carried, including one which involved the veto. It is known as the 5th resolution. Charles Butler, the leader of the English <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> vetoists, says of that resolution that it "was with the single exception of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Midland District, <em>agent of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a></em>, unanimously adopted". He was <a href="../cathen/10315a.htm">Dr. Milner</a>, whom the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had commissioned in 1807 to represent them. The <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at once condemned the 5th resolution. In May, Grattan's motion for a committee to consider the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> petition was defeated. Early in June Lord Donoughmore made a like motion in the House of Lords, which was also defeated. But here was the parting of the ways between the great body of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> led by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, with whom were the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> except <a href="../cathen/10315a.htm">Milner</a>.



<p>In 1813 Grattan, Canning, and Castlereagh brought in what purported to be a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Relief Bill, with a condition which would practically place the appointment of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the hands of a board of commissioners to be named by the king; it also provided that anyone exercising special functions or receiving documents from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> without the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of that Board, was to be considered guilty of a misdemeanour. Those uncatholic conditions notwithstanding, an amendment to the Bill was proposed and carried, which would still disable <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> "to sit and vote in Parliament". Thus the Bill was lost; bigotry had defeated itself. The <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had declared that they could not accept the Bill "without incurring the guilt of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>". A few days after, at a meeting of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Board in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, O'Connell proposed that their thanks be sent to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Some of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, who were in agreement with the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, opposed the vote; but it was carried by a very large majority. The vetoists were disappointed at the defeat of the Bill of 1813. It then occurred to them that if they could get the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in any way to countenance it, the mark of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> attached to it by the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> would no longer stain it. They therefore represented to Propanganda the great benefit which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion would derive from Emancipation, and the harmlessness of the vetoistic conditions on which the Government had offered it. <a href="../cathen/10315a.htm">Dr. Milner</a> was represented to the aged secretary of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, Mgr. Quarantotti, as one whose uncompromising attitude would fasten the chains more painfully on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; the assent of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was set forth as evidence that the veto claimed in the Bill did not contain any element of danger for religion; the motive for the opposition in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> was made to appear political rather than religious.

<p>In the light of these representations Mgr. Quarantotti, whilst rejecting certain conditions of the Relief Bill as not lawful, declared that securities for the loyalty of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> which the Government claimed might be allowed. That was the famous Rescript of February, 1814. It did not contain an order, but rather a permission, its words being: "Haec cum ita sint, indulgemus" etc., thus leaving the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> free to accept or refuse Emancipation on the condition offered. It raised a storm, however, in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> deputed <a href="../cathen/10646b.htm">Dr. Murray</a> and <a href="../cathen/10315a.htm">Dr. Milner</a> to represent to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who had been a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> when it was issued, that there was danger in the Rescript such as it was. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> declared that Mgr. Quartantotii "ought not to have written that letter without authority from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>". He appointed a commission to examine the question. In the meantime, Murat marched on <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> fled to <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>. On 26 April, 1815, <a href="../cathen/09293a.htm">Cardinal Litta</a>, prefect of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, in a letter set forth the only conditions under which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> could safely accept Emancipation. It rejected all arrangements hitherto proposed. The claim of the Government to examine communications between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> "cannot even be taken into consideration". As to the appointment of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, it said that quite enough provision had been made for their loyalty in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>; but for their greater satisfaction it permits "those to whom it appertains" to present to the king's <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> a list of the candidates they select for <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>; it insisted, however, that if those names were presented, the Government must, if it should think any of them "obnoxious or suspected" name him "at once"; moreover, that a sufficient number, from amongst whom the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> would appoint the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, must always remain even after the government objection.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> had become so mistrustful of the Government that they still feared danger and they sent deputies to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to make known their feelings to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Two replies were sent, one to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the other to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> insisted on the terms of <a href="../cathen/09293a.htm">Cardinal Litta's</a> letter, pointing out its reasonableness under the trying circumstances. According to the terms of the letter it would, in fact, be the fault of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> who had the selection of candidates if any undesirable <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> were left for <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> appointment. <a href="../cathen/09293a.htm">Cardinal Litta's</a> letter was the last <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> document issued on the veto question. The controversy between vetoists and anti-vetoists was, however, kept alive by the passions which it had raised. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause grew so hopeless that in December, 1821, O'Connell submitted to Dr. Blake, the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, a sort of veto plan, to get his opinion on it. Soon after the prospect grew brighter; O'Connell founded the Catholic Association in 1823, through which he won Emancipation six years later for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>--without a veto.
