<h1>The Second Council of Nicaea</h1>  

<p>Seventh <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">Ecumenical Council</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, held in 787. (For an account of the controversies which occasioned this council and the circumstances in which it was convoked, see <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">ICONOCLASM</a>, Sections I and II.) An attempt to hold a council at Constantinople, to deal with <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclasm</a>, having been frustrated by the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclastic</a> soldiery, the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> left that city. When, however, they had reached <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> on their way back to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, they were recalled by the Empress Irene. She replaced the mutinous troops at Constantinople with troops commanded by officers in whom she had every confidence. This accomplished, in May, 787, a new council was convoked at Nicaea in Bithynia. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> letters to the empress and to the patriarch (see <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">ICONOCLASM</a>, II) prove superabundantly that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> approved the convocation of the Council. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> afterwards wrote to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>: "Et sic synodum istam, secundum nostram ordinationem, fecerunt" (Thus they have held the synod in accordance with our directions).

<p>The empress-regent and her son did not assist in person at the sessions, but they were represented there by two high officials: the patrician and former consul, Petronius, and the imperial chamberlain and logothete John, with whom was associated as secretary the former patriarch, Nicephorus. The acts represent as constantly at the head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> members the two Roman <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> Peter and the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> Peter; after them come Tarasius, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, and then two Oriental <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, John and Thomas, representatives of the Patriarchs of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The operations of the council show that Tarasius, properly speaking, conducted the sessions. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> John and Thomas professed to represent the Oriental <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, though these did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the council had been convoked. However, there was no <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> on their part: they had been sent, not by the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, but by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of superior rank acting <em>sedibus impeditis</em>, in the stead and place of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> who were prevented from acting for themselves. Necessity was their excuse. Moreover, John and Thomas did not subscribe at the Council as vicars of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, but simply in the name of the Apostolic sees of the Orient. With the exception of these <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and the Roman <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, all the members of the Council were subjects of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>. Their number, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as well as representatives of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, varies in the ancient historians between 330 and 367; Nicephorus makes a manifest mistake in speaking of only 150 members: the Acts of the Council which we still possess show not fewer than 308 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or representatives of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. To these may be added a certain number of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrites</a>, imperial secretaries, and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> of Constantinople who had not the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to vote.

<p>The first session opened in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Sophia, 24 September, 787. Tarasius opened the council with a short discourse: "Last year, in the beginning of the month of August, it was desired to hold, under my presidency, a council in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Apostles at Constantinople; but through the fault of several <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> whom it would be easy to count, and whose names I prefer not to mention, since everybody knows them, that council was made impossible. The sovereigns have deigned to convoke another at <a href="../cathen/11043a.htm">Nicaea</a>, and Christ will certainly reward them for it. It is this Lord and Saviour whom the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> must also invoke in order to pronounce subsequently an equitable judgment in a just and impartial manner." The members then proceeded to the reading of various official documents, after which three <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclastic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had retracted were permitted to take their seats. Seven others who had plotted to make the Council miscarry in the preceding year presented themselves and declared themselves ready to profess the Faith of the Fathers, but the assembly thereupon engaged in a long discussion concerning the admission of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and postponed their case to another session. On 26 September, the second session was held, during which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> letters to the empress and the Patriarch Tarasius were read. Tarasius declared himself in full agreement with the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> set forth in these letters. On 28, or 29, September, in the third session, some <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had retracted their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> were allowed to take their seats, after which various documents were read. The fourth session was held on 1 October. In it the secretaries of the council read a long series of citations from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and the Fathers in favour of the veneration of images. Afterwards the dogmatic <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was presented, and was signed by all the members present, by the <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrites</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and by some <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> added a declaration to the effect that they were ready to receive all who had abandoned the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclastic heresy</a>. In the fifth session on 4 October, passages form the Fathers were read which declared, or seemed to declare, against the worship of images, but the reading was not continued to the end, and the council decided in favour of the restoration and veneration of images. On 6 October, in the sixth session, the doctrines of the <em>conciliabulum</em> of 753 were refuted. The discussion was endless, but in the course of it several noteworthy things were said. The next session, that of 13 October, was especially important; at it was read the <em>horos</em>, or dogmatic decision, of the council [see <a href="../cathen/07664a.htm">VENERATION OF IMAGES</a> (6)]. The last (eighth) was held in the Magnaura Palace, at Constantinople, in presence of the empress and her son, on 23 October. It was spent in discourses, signing of names, and acclamations.

<p>The council <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> twenty-two canons relating to points of discipline, which may be summarized as follows: <ul> <li>Canon 1: The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> must observe "the holy canons," which include the Apostolic, those of the six previous Ecumenical Councils, those of the particular <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> which have been published at other <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, and those of the Fathers. <li>Canon 2: Candidates for a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> orders must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> by heart and must have read thoroughly, not cursorily, all the sacred Scriptures. <li>Canon 3 condemns the appointment of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> by secular princes. <li>Canon 4: Bishops are not to demand money of their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>: any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who through <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> deprives one of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> is himself deposed. <li>Canon 5 is directed against those who boast of having obtained church preferment with money, and recalls the Thirtieth Apostolic Canon and the canons of Chalcedon against those who buy preferment with money. <li>Canon 6: Provincial <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> are to be held annually. <li>Canon 7: <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">Relics</a> are to be placed in all churches: no church is to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> without <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. <li>Canon 8 prescribes precautions to be taken against feigned converts from <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>. <li>Canon 9: All writings against the venerable images are to be surrendered, to be shut up with other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> books. <li>Canon 10: Against <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who leave their own <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> without permission, and become private <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> to great personages. <li>Canon 11: Every church and every <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> must have its own &oelig;conomus. <li>Canon 12: Against <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> who convey <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> to temporal lords. <li>Canon 13: Episcopal residences, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> buildings converted to profane uses are to be restored their rightful ownership. <li>Canon 14: <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">Tonsured</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> not <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a> must not read the Epistle or Gospel in the <a href="../cathen/01381e.htm">ambo</a>. <li>Canon 15: Against pluralities of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. <li>Canon 16: The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> must not wear sumptuous apparel. <li>Canon 17: Monks are not to leave their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and begin building other houses of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> without being provided with the means to finish the same. <li>Canon 18: Women are not to dwell in <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops'</a> houses or in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of men. <li>Canon 19: Superiors of churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> are not to demand money of those who enter the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> or monastic state. But the dowry brought by a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> to a religious house is to be retained by that house if the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> leaves it without any fault on the part of the superior. <li>Canon 20 prohibits <a href="../cathen/10452a.htm">double monasteries</a>. <li>Canon 21: A <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> or <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> may not leave one <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> for another. <li>Canon 22: Among the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of opposite sexes may eat together, provided they give thanks and behave with decorum.
