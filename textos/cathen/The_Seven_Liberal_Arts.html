<h1>The Seven Liberal Arts</h1>  

<p>The expression <em>artes liberales</em>, chiefly used during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, does not mean arts as we understand the word at this present day, but those branches of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which were taught in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of that time. They are called liberal (<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>liber</em>, free), because they serve the purpose of training the free man, in contrast with the <em>artes illiberales</em>, which are pursued for <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> purposes; their aim is to prepare the student not for gaining a livelihood, but for the pursuit of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> in the strict sense of the term, i.e. the combination of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> known as scholasticism. They are seven in number and may be arranged in two groups, the first embracing grammar, rhetoric, and dialectic, in other words, the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> of language, of oratory, and of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, better known as the <em>artes sermocinales</em>, or language studies; the second group comprises arithmetic, geometry, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, and music, i.e. the mathematico-physical disciplines, known as the <em>artes reales</em>, or <em>physicae</em>. The first group is considered to be the elementary group, whence these branches are also called <em>artes triviales</em>, or <em>trivium</em>, i.e. a well-beaten ground like the junction of three roads, or a cross-roads open to all. Contrasted with them we find the mathematical disciplines as <em>artes quadriviales</em>, or <em>quadrivium</em>, or a road with four branches. The seven liberal arts are thus the members of a system of studies which embraces language branches as the lower, the mathematical branches as the intermediate, and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> properly so called as the uppermost and terminal grade. Though this system did not receive the distinct development connoted by its name until the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, still it extends in the history of pedagogy both backwards and forwards; for while, on the one hand, we meet with it among the classical nations, the Greeks and Romans, and even discover analogous forms as forerunners in the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> system of the ancient Orientals, its influence, on the other hand, has lasted far beyond the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, up to the present time.

<p>It is desirable, for several reasons, to treat the system of the seven liberal arts from this point of view, and this we propose to do in the present article. The subject possesses a special interest for the historian, because an evolution, extending through more than two thousand years and still in active operation, here challenges our attention as surpassing both in its duration and its local ramifications all other phases of pedagogy. But it is equally instructive for the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> because thinkers like Pythagoras, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> collaborated in the framing of the system, and because in general much thought and, we may say, much pedagogical wisdom have been embodied in it. Hence, also, it is of importance to the practical teacher, because among the comments of so many <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">schoolmen</a> on this subject may be found many suggestions which are of the greatest utility.

<p>The Oriental system of study, which exhibits an instructive analogy with the one here treated, is that of the ancient <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a> still in vogue among the Brahmins. In this, the highest object is the study of the Veda, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> or <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of divine things, the summary of their speculative and religious writings for the understanding of which ten auxiliary <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> were pressed into service, four of which, viz. phonology, grammar, <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, are of a linguistico-logical nature, and can thus be compared with the Trivium; while two, viz. <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a> and metrics, belong to the domain of mathematics, and therefore to the Quadrivium. The remainder, viz. law, ceremonial lore, legendary lore, and <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, belong to <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. Among the Greeks the place of the Veda is taken by philosophy, i.e. the study of wisdom, the <em>science of ultimate causes</em> which in one point of view is identical with <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. "Natural Theology", i.e. the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">nature of the Godhead</a> and of Divine things, was considered as the domain of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, just as "political <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>" was that of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and "mystical <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>" of the poet. [See O. Willmann, Geschichte des Idealismus (Brunswick, 1894), I, sect. 10.] Pythagoras (who flourished between 540 B.C. and 510 B.C.) first called himself a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, but was also esteemed as the greatest Greek <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>. The curriculum which he arranged for his pupils led up to the <em>hieros logos</em>, i.e. the sacred teaching, the preparation for which the students received as <em>mathematikoi</em>, i.e. learners, or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> occupied with the <em>mathemata</em>, the "science of learning" &#151; that, in fact, now known as mathematics. The preparation for this was that which the disciples underwent as <em>akousmatikoi</em>, "hearers", after which preparation they were introduced to what was then current among the Greeks as <em>mousike paideia</em>, "musical education", consisting of reading, writing, lessons from the poets, exercises in memorizing, and the technique of music. The intermediate position of mathematics is attested by the ancient expression of the Pythagoreans <em>metaichmon</em>, i.e. "spear-distance"; properly, the space between the combatants; in this case, between the elementary and the strictly scientific <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Pythagoras is moreover renowned for having converted geometrical, i.e. mathematical, investigation into a form of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> for freemen. (Proclus, Commentary on Euclid, I, p. 19, <em>ten peri ten geometrian philosophian eis schema paideias eleutherou metestesen</em>.) "He discovered a mean or intermediate stage between the mathematics of the temple and the mathematics of practical life, such as that used by surveyors and business people; he preserves the high aims of the former, at the same time making it the palaestra of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; he presses a religious discipline into the service of secular life without, however, robbing it of its sacred character, just as he previously transformed physical <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> into natural philosophy without alienating it from its hallowed origin" (Geschichte des Idealismus, I, 19 at the end). An extension of the elementary studies was brought about by the active, though somewhat unsettled, <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> life which developed after the Persian <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> in the fifth century B.C. From the plain study of reading and writing they advanced to the art of speaking and its theory (rhetoric), with which was combined dialectic, properly the art of alternate discourse, or the discussion of the <em>pro</em> and <em>con</em>. This change was brought about by the <a href="../cathen/14145c.htm">sophists</a>, particularly by Gorgias of Leontium. They also attached much importance to manysidedness in their theoretical and practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Of Hippias of Elis it is related that he boasted of having made his mantle, his tunic, and his foot-gear (Cicero, De Oratore, iii, 32, 127). In this way, current language gradually began to designate the whole body of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as <em>encyclical</em>, i.e. as universal, or all-embracing (<em>egkyklia paideumata</em>, or <em>methemata</em>; <em>egkyklios paideia</em>). The expression indicated originally the current <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> common to all, but later assumed the above-mentioned meaning, which has also passed into our word <em>encyclopedia</em>.



<p><a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> having already strongly emphasized the moral aims of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> (429-347 B.C.) protested against its degeneration from an effort to acquire culture into a heaping-up of multifarious information (<em>polypragmosyne</em>). In the "Republic" he proposes a course of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> which appears to be the Pythagorean course perfected. It begins with musico-gymnastic culture, by means of which he aims to impress upon the senses the fundamental forms of the beautiful and the good, i.e. rhythm and form (<em>aisthesis</em>). The intermediate course embraces the mathematical branches, viz. arithmetic, geometry, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, and music, which are calculated to put into action the powers of reflection (<em>dianoia</em>), and to enable the student to progress by degrees from sensuous to <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> perception, as he successively masters the theory of numbers, of forms, of the kinetic <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of bodies, and of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of (musical) sounds. This leads to the highest grade of the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> system, its pinnacle (<em>thrigkos</em>) so to speak, i.e. philosophy, which <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> calls dialectic, thereby elevating the word from its current meaning to signify the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of the Eternal as ground and prototype of the world of sense. This progress to dialectic (<em>dialektike poreia</em>) is the work of our highest cognitive faculty, the <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuitive</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> (<em>nous</em>). In this manner <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> secures a <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a>, or noetic, basis for the sequence of his studies, namely: sense-perception, reflection, and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> insight. During the Alexandrine period, which begins with the closing years of the fourth century before Christ, the encyclical studies assume scholastic forms. Grammar, as the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of language (technical grammar) and explanation of the classics (<a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> grammar), takes the lead; rhetoric becomes an elementary course in speaking and writing. By dialectic they understood, in accordance with the teaching of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, directions enabling the student to present acceptable and valid views on a given subject; thus dialectic became elementary practical <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>. The mathematical studies retained their <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> order; by means of <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> poems, the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of the stars, and by means of works on geography, the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of the globe became parts of popular <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> (Strabo, Geographica, I, 1, 21-23). Philosophy remained the culmination of the encyclical studies, which bore to it the relation of maids to a mistress, or of a temporary shelter to the fixed home (Diog. Laert., II, 79; cf. the author's Didaktik als Bildungslehre, I, 9).

<p>Among the Romans grammar and rhetoric were the first to obtain a firm foothold; culture was by them identified with eloquence, as the art of speaking and the mastery of the spoken word based upon a manifold <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things. In his "Institutiones Oratoriae" Quintilian, the first <em>professor eloquentiae</em> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian's</a> time, begins his instruction with grammar, or, to speak precisely, with Latin and Greek Grammar, proceeds to mathematics and music, and concludes with rhetoric, which comprises not only elocution and a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of literature, but also <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> &#151; in other words <a href="../cathen/04770a.htm">dialectical</a> &#151; instruction. However, the encyclical system as the system of the liberal arts, or <em>Artes Bonae</em>, i.e. the learning of the <em>vir bonus</em>, or patriot, was also represented in special handbooks. The "Libri IX Disciplinarum" of the learned M. Terentius Varro of <a href="../cathen/13054a.htm">Reate</a>, an earlier contemporary of Cicero, treats of the seven liberal arts adding to them medicine and architectonics. How the latter <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> came to be connected with the general studies is shown in the book "De Architectur&acirc;", by M. Vitruvius Pollio, a writer of the time of <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>, in which excellent remarks are made on the organic connection existing between all studies. "The inexperienced", he says, "may wonder at the fact that so many various things can be retained in the memory; but as soon as they observe that all branches of learning have a real connection with, and a reciprocal action upon, each other, the matter will seem very simple; for universal <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> (<em>egkyklios</em>, <em>disciplina</em>) is composed of the special <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> as a body is composed of members, and those who from their earliest youth have been instructed in the different branches of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<em>variis eruditionibus</em>) recognize in all the same fundamental features (<em>notas</em>) and the mutual relations of all branches, and therefore grasp everything more easily" (Vitr., De Architectur&acirc;, I, 1, 12). In these views the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> conception is still operative, and the Romans always retained the conviction that in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> alone was to be found the perfection of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Cicero enumerates the following as the elements of a liberal <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>: geometry, literature, poetry, natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, ethics, and politics. (Artes quibus liberales doctrinae atque ingenuae continentur; geometria, litterarum cognito et poetarum, atque illa quae de naturis rerum, quae de hominum moribus, quae de rebus publicis dicuntur.)

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> taught <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to regard <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and culture as a work for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, to which all temporary objects are secondary. It softened, therefore, the antithesis between the liberal and illiberal arts; the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth attains its purpose when it acts so "that the man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be perfect, furnished to every good work" (<a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#vrs17">2 Timothy 3:17</a>). In consequence, labour, which among the classic nations had been regarded as unworthy of the freeman, who should live only for leisure, was now ennobled; but learning, the offspring of leisure, lost nothing of its dignity. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> retained the expression, <em>mathemata eleuthera</em>, <em>studia liberalia</em>, as well as the gradation of these studies, but now <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was the crown of the system in the form of religious instruction for the people, and of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> for the learned. The appreciation of the several branches of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was largely influenced by the view expressed by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> in his little book, "De Doctrin&acirc; Christian&acirc;". As a former teacher of rhetoric and as master of eloquence he was thoroughly familiar with the <em>Artes</em> and had written upon some of them. Grammar retains the first place in the order of studies, but the study of words should not interfere with the search for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which they contain. The choicest gift of bright minds is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, not of the words expressing it. "For what avails a golden key if it cannot give access to the object which we wish to reach, and why find fault with a wooden key if it serves our purpose?" (De Doctr. Christ., IV, 11, 26). In estimating the importance of linguistic studies as a means of interpreting Scripture, stress should be laid upon <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a>, rather than technical grammar. Dialectic must also prove its worth in the interpretation of Scripture; "it traverses the entire text like a tissue of nerves" (Per totum textum scripturarum colligata est nervorum vice, ibid., II, 40, 56). Rhetoric contains the rules of fuller discussion (praecepta uberioris disputationis); it is to be used rather to set forth what we have understood than to aid us in understanding (ibid., II, 18). St. Augustine compared a masterpiece of rhetoric with the wisdom and beauty of the cosmos, and of history &#151; "Ita qu&acirc;dam non verborum, sed rerum, eloquenti&acirc; contrariorum oppositione seculi pulchritudo componitur" (<a href="../fathers/120111.htm"><em>City of God</em> XI.18</a>). Mathematics was not invented by man, but its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> were discovered; they make known to us the mysteries concealed in the numbers found in Scripture, and lead the mind upwards from the mutable to the immutable; and interpreted in the spirit of Divine Love, they become for the mind a source of that wisdom which has ordered all things by measure, weight, and number (De Doctr. Christ., II, 39, also Wisdom, xi, 21). The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> elaborated by the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of old, like precious ore drawn from the depths of an all-ruling Providence, should be applied by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> in the spirit of the Gospel, just as the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> used the <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> of the Egyptians for the service of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">true God</a> (De Doctr. Christ., II, 41).

<p>The series of text-books on this subject in vogue during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> begins with the work of an African, Marcianus Capella, written at Carthage about A.D. 420. It bears the title "Satyricon Libri IX" from <em>satura</em>, sc. <em>lanx</em>, "a full dish". In the first two books, "Nuptiae Philologiae et Mercurii", carrying out the allegory that Phoebus presents the Seven Liberal Arts as maids to the bride Philology, mythological and other topics are treated. In the seven books that follow, each of the Liberal Arts presents the sum of her teaching. A simpler presentation of the same subject is found in the little book, intended for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, entitled, "De artibus ac disciplinis liberalium artium", which was written by Magnus Aurelius Cassiodrus in the reign of <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>. Here it may be noted that <em>Ars</em> means "text-book", as does the Greek word <em>techen</em>; <em>disciplina</em> is the translation of the Greek <em>mathesis</em> or <em>mathemata</em>, and stood in a narrower sense for the mathematical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> derives the word <em>liberalis</em> not from <em>liber</em>, "free", but from <em>liber</em>, "book", thus indicating the change of these studies to book learning, as well as the disappearance of the view that other occupations are servile and unbecoming a free man. Again we meet with the <em>Artes</em> at the beginning of an encyclopedic work entitled "Origines, sive Etymologiae", in twenty books, compiled by St. Isidore, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, about 600. The first book of this work treats of grammar; the second, of rhetoric and dialectic, both comprised under the name of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>; the third, of the four mathematical branches. In books IV-VIII follow medicine, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>; but books IX and X give us linguistic material, etymologies, etc., and the remaining books present a miscellany of useful information. Albinus (or <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>), the well-known statesman and counsellor of Charles the Great, dealt with the <em>Artes</em> in separate treatises, of which only the treatises intended as guides to the Trivium have come down to us. In the introduction, he finds in Prov. ix, 1 (Wisdom hath built herself a house, she hath hewn her out seven pillars) an allusion to the seven liberal arts which he thinks are meant by the seven pillars. The book is written in dialogue form, the scholar asking questions, and the master answering them. One of <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin's</a> pupils, <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a>, who died in 850 as the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, in his book entitled "De institutione clericorum", gave short instructions concerning the <em>Artes</em>, and published under the title, "De Universo", what might be called an encyclopedia. The extraordinary activity displayed by the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> as teachers in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> led to the designation of the <em>Artes</em> as <em>Methodus Hybernica</em>. To impress the sequence of the arts on the memory of the student, mnemonic verses were employed such as the hexameter; <blockquote> Lingua, tropus, ratio, numerus, tonus, angulus, astra. <br>Gram loquiter, Dia vera docet, Rhe verba colorat <br>Mu canit, Ar numerat, Geo ponderat, Ast colit astra. </blockquote>

<p>By the number seven the system was made popular; the Seven Arts recalled the Seven Petitions of the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>, the Seven Gifts of the Holy Ghost, the Seven Sacraments, the Seven Virtues, etc. The Seven Words on the Cross, the Seven Pillars of Wisdom, the Seven Heavens might also suggest particular branches of learning. The seven liberal arts found counterparts in the seven mechanical arts; the latter included weaving, blacksmithing, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, navigation, agriculture, hunting, medicine, and the <em>ars theatrica</em>. To these were added dancing, wrestling, and driving. Even the accomplishments to be mastered by candidates for <a href="../cathen/01695a.htm">knighthood</a> were fixed at seven: riding, tilting, fencing, wrestling, running, leaping, and spear-throwing. Pictorial illustrations of the <em>Artes</em> are often found, usually <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> figures with suitable attributes; thus Grammar appears with book and rod, Rhetoric with tablet and stilus, Dialectic with a dog's head in her hand, probably in contrast to the wolf of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> &#151; cf. the play on words <em>Domini canes, Dominicani</em> &#151; Arithmetic with a knotted rope, Geometry with a pair of compasses and a rule, Astronomy with bushel and stars, and Music with cithern and organistrum. Portraits of the chief representatives of the different <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> were added. Thus in the large group by <a href="../cathen/06332b.htm">Taddeo Gaddi</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Novella in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in 1322, the central figure of which is <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, Grammar appears with either Donatus (who lived about A.D. 250) or Priscian (about A.D. 530), the two most prominent teachers of grammar, in the act of instructing a boy; Rhetoric accompanied by Cicero; Dialectic by <a href="../cathen/15756b.htm">Zeno of Elea</a>, whom the ancients considered as founder of the art; Arithmetic by Abraham, as the representative of the philosophy of numbers, and versed in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the stars; Geometry by Euclid (about 300 B.C.), whose "Elements" was the text-book <em>par excellence</em>; Astronomy by Ptolemy, whose "Almagest" was considered to be the canon of star-lore; Music by Tubal Cain using the hammer, probably in allusion to the harmoniously tuned hammers which are said to have suggested to Pythagoras his theory of intervals. As counterparts of the liberal arts are found seven higher <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>: <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, canon law, and the five branches of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> entitled speculative, scriptural, scholastic, contemplative, and apologetic. (Cf. Geschichte des Idealismus, II, Par. 74, where the position of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> towards the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> is discussed.)

<p>An instructive picture of the seven liberal arts in the twelfth century may be found in the work entitled "Didascalicum", or "Eruditio Didascalici", written by the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian canon</a>, <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugo of St. Victor</a>, who died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in 1141. He was descended from the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Counts Blankenburg in the Harz Mountains and received his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at the Augustinian <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Hammersleben in the Diocese of Halberstadt, where he devoted himself to the liberal arts from 1109 to 1114. In his "Didascalicum", VI, 3, he writes "I make bold to say that I never have despised anything belonging to erudition, but have learned much which to others seemed to be trifling and foolish. I remember how, as a schoolboy, I endeavoured to ascertain the names of all objects which I saw, or which came under my hands, and how I formulated my own thoughts concerning them [<em>perpendens libere</em>], namely: that one cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the nature of things before having learned their names. How often have I set myself as a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> daily task the study of problems [<em>sophismata</em>] which I had jotted down for the sake of brevity, by means of a catchword or two [<em>dictionibus</em>] on the page, in order to commit to memory the solution and the number of nearly all the opinions, questions, and objections which I had learned. I invented legal cases and analyses with pertinent objections [<em>dispositiones ad invicem controversiis</em>], and in doing so carefully distinguished between the methods of the rhetorician, the orator, and the <a href="../cathen/14145c.htm">sophist</a>. I represented numbers by pebbles, and covered the floor with black lines, and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> clearly by the diagram before me the differences between acute-angled, right-angled, and obtuse-angled triangles; in like manner I ascertained whether a square has the same area as a rectangle two of whose sides are multiplied, by stepping off the length in both cases [<em>utrobique procurrente podismo</em>]. I have often watched through the winter night, gazing at the stars [<em>horoscopus</em> &#151; not <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrological</a> forecasting, which was forbidden, but pure star-study]. Often have I strung the magada [Gr. <em>magadis</em>, an instrument of 20 strings, giving ten tones] measuring the strings according to numerical values, and stretching them over the wood in order to catch with my ear the difference between the tones, and at the same time to gladden my heart with the sweet melody. This was all done in a boyish way, but it was far from useless, for this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was not burdensome to me. I do not recall these things in order to boast of my attainments, which are of little or no value, but to show you that the most orderly worker is the most skillful one [<em>illum incedere aptissime qui incedit ordinate</em>], unlike many who, wishing to take a great jump, fall into an abyss; for as with the virtues, so in the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> there are fixed steps. But, you will say, I find in histories much useless and forbidden matter; why should I busy myself therewith? Very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, there are in the Scriptures many things which, considered in themselves, are apparently not worth acquiring, but which, if you compare them with others connected with them, and if you weigh them, bearing in mind this connection [<em>in toto suo trutinare caeperis</em>], will prove to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and useful. Some things are worth knowing on their own account; but others, although apparently offering no return for our trouble, should not be neglected, because without them the former cannot be thoroughly mastered [<em>enucleate sciri non possunt</em>]. Learn everything; you will afterwards discover that nothing is superfluous; limited <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> affords no enjoyment [<em>coarctata scientia jucunda non est</em>]."

<p>The connection of the <em>Artes</em> with philosophy and wisdom was faithfully kept in mind during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Hugo says of it: "Among all the departments of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> the ancients assigned seven to be studied by beginners, because they found in them a higher value than in the others, so that whoever has thoroughly mastered them can afterwards master the rest rather by research and practice than by the teacher's oral instruction. They are, as it were, the best tools, the fittest entrance through which the way to philosophic <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is opened to our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Hence the names <em>trivium</em> and <em>quadrivium</em>, because here the robust mind progresses as if upon roads or paths to the secrets of wisdom. It is for this reason that there were among the ancients, who followed this path, so many wise men. Our <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">schoolmen</a> [<em>scholastici</em>] are disinclined, or do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> while studying, how to adhere to the appropriate method, whence it is that there are many who labour earnestly [<em>studentes</em>], but few wise men" (Didascalicum, III, 3).

<p>St. Bonaventure (1221-74) in his treatise "De Reductione artium ad theologiam" proposes a profound explanation of the origin of the <em>Artes</em>, including philosophy; basing it upon the method of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> as the method of all teaching. <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> speaks to us in three ways: by speech (<em>sermo</em>), by instruction (<em>doctrina</em>), and by directions for living (<em>vita</em>). It is the source of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in speech, of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in things, and of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, and therefore equally of rational, natural, and moral philosophy. Rational philosophy, having for object the spoken <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, treats it from the triple point of view of expression, of communication, and of impulsion to action; in other words it aims to express, to teach, to persuade (<em>exprimere, docere, movere</em>). These activities are represented by <em>sermo congruus, versus, ornatus</em>, and the arts of grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric. Natural philosophy seeks the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in things themselves as <em>rationes ideales</em>, and accordingly it is divided into physics, mathematics, and <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>. Moral philosophy determines the <em>veritas vit&aelig;</em> for the life of the individual as <em>monastica</em> (<em>monos</em> alone), for the domestic life as <em>oeconomica</em>, and for <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> as <em>politica</em>.

<p>To general erudition and encyclopedic learning <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> has less close relations than that of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, principally because the Trivium had a formal character, i.e. it aimed at training the mind rather than imparting <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. The reading of classic authors was considered as an appendix to the Trivium. Hugo, who, as we have seen, does not undervalue it, includes in his reading poems, fables, histories, and certain other elements of instruction (<em>poemata, fabulae, historiae, didascaliae quaedam</em>). The <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of language, to use the expression of Augustine, is still designated as the key to all positive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; for this reason its position at the head of the Arts (<em>Artes</em>) is maintained. So <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a> (b. between 1110 and 1120; d. 1180, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>) says: "If grammar is the key of all literature, and the mother and mistress of language, who will be bold enough to turn her away from the threshold of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>? Only he who thinks that what is written and spoken is unnecessary for the student of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>" (Metalogicus, I, 21). <a href="../cathen/13045c.htm">Richard of St. Victor</a> (d. 1173) makes grammar the servant of history, for he writes, "All arts serve the Divine Wisdom, and each lower art, if rightly ordered, leads to a higher one. Thus the relation existing between the word and the thing required that grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric should minister to history" (Rich., ap. Vincentium Bell., Spec. Doctrinale, XVII, 31). The Quadrivium had, naturally, certain relations to to the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> and to life; this was recognized by treating geography as a part of geometry, and the study of the calendar as part of <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>. We meet with the development of the <em>Artes</em> into encyclopedic <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as early as Isadore of Seville and <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a>, especially in the latter's work, "De Universo". It was completed in the thirteenth century, to which belong the works of <a href="../cathen/15439a.htm">Vincent of Beauvais</a> (d. 1264), instructor of the children of St. Louis (IX). In his "Speculum Naturale" he treats of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and nature; in the "Speculum Doctrinale", starting from the Trivium, he deals with the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>; in the "Speculum Morale" he discusses the moral world. To these a continuator added a "Speculum Historiale" which was simply a universal history.

<p>For the academic development of the <em>Artes</em> it was of importance that the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> accepted them as a part of their curricula. Among their <em>ordines</em>, or faculties, the <em>ordo artistarum</em>, afterwards called the faculty of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, was fundamental: <em>Universitas fundatur in artibus</em>. It furnished the preparation not only for the <em>Ordo Theologorum</em>, but also for the <em>Ordo Legistarum</em>, or law faculty, and the <em>Ordo Physicorum</em>, or medical faculty. Of the methods of teaching and the continued study of the arts at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> in the fifteenth century, the text-book of the contemporary <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a>, <a href="../cathen/12731a.htm">Gregory Reisch</a>, Confessor of the Emperor Maximilian I, gives us a clear picture. He treats in twelve books: (I) of the Rudiments of Grammar; (II) of the Principles of Logic; (III) of the Parts of an Oration; (IV) of Memory, of Letter-writing, and of Arithmetic; (V) of the Principles of Music; (VI) of the Elements of Geometry; (VII) of the Principles of Astronomy; (VIII) of the Principles of Natural Things; (IX) of the Origin of Natural Things; (X) of the Soul; (XI) of the Powers; (XII) of the Principles of Moral Philosophy.-- The illustrated edition printed in 1512 at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> has for appendix: the elements of Greek literature, Hebrew, figured music and architecture, and some technical instruction (Graecarum Litterarum Institutiones, Hebraicarum Litterarum Rudimenta, Musicae Figuratae Institutiones, Architecturae Rudimenta).

<p>At the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> the <em>Artes</em>, at least in a formal way, held their place up to modern times. At Oxford, <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a> (1553-58) erected for them colleges whose inscriptions are significant, thus: "Grammatica, Litteras disce"; "Rhetorica persuadet mores"; "Dialectica, Imposturas fuge"; "Arithmetica, Omnia numeris constant"; "Musica, Ne tibi dissideas"; "Geometria, Cura, quae domi sunt"; "Astronomia, Altiora ne quaesieris". The title "Master of the Liberal Arts" is still granted at some of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> in connection with the Doctorate of Philosophy; in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> that of "Doctor of Music" is still in regular use. In practical teaching, however, the system of the <em>Artes</em> has declined since the sixteenth century. The <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> saw in the technique of style (<em>eloquentia</em>) and in its mainstay, erudition, the ultimate object of collegiate <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, thus following the Roman rather than the Greek system. Grammar and rhetoric came to be the chief elements of the preparatory studies, while the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> of the Quadrivium were embodied in the miscellaneous learning (<em>eruditio</em>) associated with rhetoric. In <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> higher <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> philosophy remained as the intermediate stage between philological studies and professional studies; while according to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> scheme philosophy was taken over (to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>) as a Faculty subject. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> present the following gradation of studies: grammar, rhetoric, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and, since philosophy begins with <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, this system retains also the ancient dialectic.

<p>In the erudite studies spoken of above, must be sought the germ of the encyclopedic learning which grew unceasingly during the seventeenth century. Amos Comenius (d. 1671), the best known representative of this tendency, who sought in his "Orbis Pictus" to make this diminutive encyclopedia (<em>encyclop&aelig;diola</em>) the basis of the earliest grammatical instruction, speaks contemptuously of "those liberal arts so much talked of, the knowledge of which the common people believe a master of philosophy to acquire thoroughly", and proudly declares, "Our men rise to greater height". (Magna Didactica, xxx, 2.) His <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> classes are the following: grammar, physics, mathematics, ethics, dialectic, and rhetoric. In the eighteenth century undergraduate studies take on more and more the encyclopedic character, and in the nineteenth century the class system is replaced by the department system, in which the various subjects are treated simultaneously with little or no reference to their gradation; in this way the principle of the <em>Artes</em> is finally surrendered. Where, moreover, as in the <em>Gymnasia</em> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, philosophy has been dropped from the course of studies, miscellaneous erudition becomes in principle an end unto itself. Nevertheless, present <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> systems preserve traces of the older systematic arrangement (language, mathematics, philosophy). In the early years of his <em>Gymnasium</em> course the youth must devoted his time and energy to the study of languages, in the middle years, principally to mathematics, and in his last years, when he is called upon to express his own thoughts, he begins to deal with <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> and dialectic, even if it be only in the form of composition. He is therefore touching upon philosophy. This gradation which works its own way, so to speak, out of the present chaotic condition of learned studies, should be made systematic; the fundamental <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <em>Artes Liberales</em> would thus be revived.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, therefore, that we should advance gradually from sense-perception by way of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> argumentation to <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a>, is by no means antiquated. Mathematical instruction, admittedly a preparation for the study of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, could only gain if it were conducted in this spirit, if it were made <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> clearer, if its technical content were reduced, and if it were followed by <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>. The express correlation of mathematics to <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, and to musical theory, would bring about a wholesome concentration of the mathematico-physical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, now threatened with a plethora of erudition. The insistence of older writers upon the organic character of the content of instruction deserves earnest consideration. For the purpose of concentration a mere packing together of uncorrelated subjects will not suffice; their original connection and dependence must be brought into clear consciousness. Hugo's admonition also, to distinguish between hearing (or learning, properly so called) on the one hand, and practice and invention on the other, for which there is good opportunity in grammar and mathematics, deserves attention. Equally important is his demand that the details of the subject taught be weighed &#151; <em>trutinare</em>, from <em>trutina</em>, the goldsmith's balance. This gold balance has been used far too sparingly, and, in consequence, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> has suffered. A short-sighted realism threatens even the various branches of language instruction. Efforts are made to restrict grammar to the vernacular, and to banish rhetoric and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> except so far as they are applied in composition. It is, therefore, not useless to remember the "keys". In every department of instruction method must have in view the series: induction, based on sensuous perception; deduction, guided also by perception, and abstract deduction &#151; a series which is identical with that of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. All understanding implies these three grades; we first understand the meaning of what is said, we next understand inferences drawn from sense perception, and lastly we understand dialectic conclusions. Invention has also three grades: we find words, we find the solution of problems, we find thoughts. Grammar, mathematics, and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> likewise form a systematic series. The grammatical system is empirical, the mathematical rational and constructive, and the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> rational and speculative (cf. O. Willmann, Didaktik, II, 67). Humanists, over-fond of change, <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> condemned the system of the seven liberal arts as barbarous. It is no more barbarous than the <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style, a name intended to be a reproach. The Gothic, built up on the conception of the old basilica, ancient in origin, yet <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> in character, was misjudged by the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> on account of some excrescences, and obscured by the additions engrafted upon it by modern lack of taste (op. cit., p. 230). That the achievements of our forefathers should be understood, recognized, and adapted to our own needs, is surely to be desired.
