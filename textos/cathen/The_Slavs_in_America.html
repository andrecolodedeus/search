<h1>The Slavs in America</h1>  

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> races have sent large numbers of their people to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and this immigration is coming every year in increasing numbers. The earliest immigration began before the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the States, but within the past thirty years it has become so great as quite to overshadow the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and German immigration of the earlier decades. For two-thirds of that period no accurate figures of tongues or nationalities were kept, the immigrants being merely credited to the political governments or countries from which they came, but within the past twelve years more accurate data have been preserved. During these years (1899-1910) the total immigration into the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> has been about 10,000,000 in round numbers, and of these the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> have formed about 22 percent (actually 2,117,240), to say nothing of the increase of native-born <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> in this country during that period, as well as the numbers of the earlier arrivals. Reliable estimated compiled from the various racial sources show that there are from five and a half to six millions of <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> including the native-born of <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. We are generally unaware of these facts, because the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> are less conspicuous among us than the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, or <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; their languages and their history are unfamiliar and remote, besides they are not so massed in the great cities of this country.
<h2 id="section1">Bohemians</h2>

<p>(<em>Cech</em>; adjective, <em>cesky</em>, Bohemian)

<p>These people &#151; also called the <em>Czechs</em> &#151; are named <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> after the original tribe of the Boii, who dwelt in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> in Roman times. By a curious perversion of language, on account of various gypsies who about two centuries ago travelled westward across <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and thereby came to be known in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> as "Bohemians," the word <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> came into use to designate one who lived an easy, careless life, unhampered by serious responsibilities. Such a meaning is, however, the very antithesis of the serious conservative Czech character. The names of a few <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> are found in the early history of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Augustyn Herman (1692) of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> Manor, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, and Bedrich Filip (Frederick Philipse, 1702) of Philipse Manor, Yonkers, New York, are the earliest. In 1848 the revolutionary uprisings in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> sent many <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> to this country. In the eighteenth century the Moravian Brethren (<a href="../cathen/02616a.htm">Bohemian Brethren</a>) had come in large numbers. The finding of gold in <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> in 1849-50 attracted many more, especially as serfdom and labour dues were abolished in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> at the end of 1848, which left the peasant and the workman free to travel. In 1869 and the succeeding years immigration was stimulated by the labour strikes in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, and one occasion all the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> workers of several cigar factories came over and settled in New York. About 60 percent of the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> and Moravians who have settled here are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and their churches have been fairly maintained. Their immigration during the past ten years has been 98,100, and in 1910 the number of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> immigrants and native born, was reckoned at 55,000. They have some 140 <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches and about 250 <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> priests; their <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and general institutions are active and flourishing.
<h2 id="section2">Bulgarians</h2>

<p>(<em>Bulgar</em>; adjective <em>bulgarski</em>, Bulgarian)

<p>This part of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> race inhabits the present Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> provinces of Eastern Rumelia, representing ancient <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>. Thus it happens that the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> are almost equally divided between Turkey and <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>. Their ancestors were the Bolgars or Bulgars, a Finnish tribe, which conquered, intermarried, and coalesced with the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> inhabitants, and eventually gave their name to them. The <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> tongue is in many respects the nearest to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Slavonic, and it was the ancient <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> which Sts. Cyril and Methodius are said to have learned in order to evangelize the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>. The modern <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> language, written with Russian characters and a few additions, differs from the other <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> languages in that it, like English, has lost nearly every inflection, and, like Rumanian, has the peculiarity of attaching the article to the end of the word, while the other <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> tongues have no article at all. The <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> who have gained their freedom from <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> supremacy in the present Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> are fairly contented; but those in <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a> chafe bitterly against <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> rule and form a large portion of those who <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrate</a> to America. The <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> are nearly all of the Greek <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>; there are some twenty thousand Byzantine <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, mostly in <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>, and about 50,000 Latin-Rite <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The Greek Patriach of Constantinople has always claimed <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, and he enforced his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> until 1872, when the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a> was appointed to exercise supreme <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Since that time the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> have been in a state of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> to the patriarch. They are ruled in <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> by a Holy Synod of their own, whilst the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a>, resident in Constantinople, is the head of the entire <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> Church. He is recognized by the Russian Church, but is considered <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> by the Greek Patriarch, who however retained his authority over the Greek-speaking churches of <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a> and <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>.



<p>Bulgarians came to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> as early as 1890; but there were then only a few of them as students, mostly from <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>, brought hither by mission bodies to study for the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> ministry. The real immigration began in 1905, when it seems that the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> discovered America as a land of opportunity, stimulated probably by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> and Greek persecutions then raging in Macdeonia against them. The railroads and steel works in the West needed men, and several enterprising steamship agents brought over Macedonians and <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> in large numbers. Before 1906 there were scarcely 500 to 600 <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> in the country, and these chiefly in St. Louis, Missouri. Since then they have been coming at the rate of from 8000 to 10,000 a year, until now (1911) there are from 80,000 to 90,000 <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> scattered throughout the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. The majority of them are employed in factories, railroads, mines, and sugar works. Granite City, Madison, and <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, Illinois; St. Louis, Missouri; Indianapolis, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>; Steelton, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>; Portland, <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, and New York City all have a considerable <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> population. They also take to farming and are scattered throughout the northwest. They now (1911) have three Greek Orthodox churches in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> at Granite City and Madison, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, and at Steelton, Pennsyvania, as well as several mission stations. Their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> consist of one <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and two <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>; and they also have a church in <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. There are not <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, either of the Greek or <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> sufficient to form a church here. The <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>, unlike the other <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, have no church or benefit <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> or brotherhood in America. They publish five <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> papers, of which the "Naroden Glas" of Granite City in the most important.
<h2 id="section3">Croatians</h2>

<p>(<em>Hrvat</em>; adjective, <em>hrvatski</em>, Croatian)

<p>These are the inhabitants of the autonomous or home-rule province of Croatia-Slavonia, in the southwestern part of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> where it reaches down to the Adriatic Sea. It included not only them but also the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> inhabitants of Istria and <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>, in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and those of <a href="../cathen/02694a.htm">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> who are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and use the Roman alphabet. In blood and speech the Croatians and Serbians are practically one; but religion and politics divide them. The former are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and use the Roman letters; the latter are Greek Orthodox and use modified Russian letters. In many of the places on the borderline school-children have to learn both alphabets. The English word "cravat" is derived from their name, it being the Croatian neckpiece which the south Austrian troops wore. Croatia-Slavonia itself has a population of nearly 2,500,000 and is about one-third the size of the state of New York. Croatia in the west is mountainous and somewhat poor, while Slavonia in the east is level, fertile, and productive. Many Dalmatian Croats from seaport town came here from 1850 to 1870. The original emigration from Croatia-Slavonia began in 1873, upon the completion of the new railway connections to the seaport of Fiume, when some of the more adventurous Croatians came to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. From the early eighties the Lipa-Krbava district furnished much of the emigration. The first Croatian settlements were made in Calumet, <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, while many of them became lumbermen in <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a> and stave-cutters along the Mississippi. Around <a href="../cathen/01225b.htm">Agram</a> (Zagreb, the Croatian capital) the grape disease caused large destruction of vineyards and the consequent emigration of thousands. Later on emigration began from Varasdin and from Slavonia also, and now immigrants arrive from every county in Croatia-Slavonia. In 1899 the figures for Croatia-Slavonia were 2923, and by 1907 the annual immigration had risen to 22,828, the largest number coming from <a href="../cathen/01225b.htm">Agram</a> and Varasdin Counties. Since then it has fallen off, and at the present time (1911) it is not quite 20,000. Unfortunately the governmental statistics do not separate the Slovenians from the Croatians in giving the arrivals of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austro-Hungarian</a> immigrants, but the Hungarian figures of departures serve as checks.

<p>The number of <a href="../cathen/04510a.htm">Croatians</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> at present, including the native-born, is about 280,000, divided according to their origin as follows: from Croatia-Slavonia, 160,000; <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>, 80,000; Bosnia, 20,000; Herzegovina, 15,000; and the remainder from various parts of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and Serbia. The largest group of them is in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, chiefly in the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, and they number probably from 80,000 to 100,000. Illinois has about 45,000, chiefly in <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>. <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> has about 35,000, principally in <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a> and the vicinity. Other considerable colonies are in New York, <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/08602a.htm">Kansas City</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>. They are also in <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">Montana</a>, <a href="../cathen/04129a.htm">Colorado</a>, and Michigan. The Dalmatians are chiefly engaged in business and grape culture; the other Croatians are mostly labourers employed in mining, railroad work, steel mills, stockyards, and stone quarries. Nearly all of these are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and they now have one Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and 16 Latin-Rite <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are almost wholly from the Diocese of Krizevac (Crisium), and are chiefly settled at <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> and <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>. They have some 250 <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> devoted to church and patriotic purposes, and in some cases to Socialism, but as yet they have no very large central organization, the National Croatian Union with 29,247 members being the largest. They publish ten newspapers, among them two dailies, of which "Zajednicar" the organ of Narodne Hrvatske Zajednice (National Croatian Union) is the best known.
<h2 id="section4">Poles</h2>

<p>(<em>Polak</em>, a Pole; adjective <em>polski</em>, Polish)

<p>The Poles came to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> quite early in its history. Aside from some few early settlers, the American Revolution attracted such noted men as <a href="../cathen/08694a.htm">Kosciuszko</a> and <a href="../cathen/12561a.htm">Pulaski</a>, together with many of their fellow countrymen. The Polish Revolution of 1830 brought numbers of Poles to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. In 1851 a Polish colony settled in <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>, and called their settlement Panna Marya (Our Lady Mary). In 1860 they settled at Parisville, <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, and Polonia, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>. Many distinguished Poles served in the Civil War (1861-65) upon both sides. After 1873 the Polish immigration began to grow apace, chiefly from <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. Then the tide turned and came from <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and later from Russian <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. In 1890 they began to come in the greatest numbers from <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> and Russian <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, until the flow from German <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> has largely diminished. The immigration within the past ten years has been as follows: from <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, 53 percent; from <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> about 43 percent; and only a fraction over 4 percent from the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> or German portion. It is estimated that there are at present about 3,000,000 <a href="../cathen/12204c.htm">Poles in the United States</a> counting the native-born. It may be said that they are almost solidly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>; the dissident and disturbing elements among them being but comparatively small, while there is no purely <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> element at all. They have one Polish <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, about 750 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and some 520 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, besides 355 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. There are large numbers, both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who are members of the various <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities. The Poles publish some 70 newspapers, amongst them nine dailies, 20 of which are purely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> publications. Their religious and national <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> are large and flourishing; and altogether the Polish element is active and progressive.
<h2 id="section5">Russians</h2>

<p>(<em>Rossiyanin</em>; adjective <em>rossiiski</em>, Russian)

<p>Russia is the largest nation in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and its <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> inhabitants (exclusive of Poles) are composed of Great <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russians</a> or Northern Russians, White Russians or Western Russians, and the Little Russians (Ruthenians) or Southern Russians. The area around <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> and St. Petersburg is called Great <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, in allusion to its stature and great predominance in number, government, and language. The White Russians are so called from the prevailing colour of the clothing of the peasantry, and inhabit the provinces lying on the borders of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> &#151; Vitebsk, Mohilev, <a href="../cathen/10333a.htm">Minsk</a>, <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>, and Grodno. Their language differs but slightly from Great Russian, inclining towards Polish and Old Slavonic. The Little Russians (so called from their low stature) differ considerably from the Great <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russians</a> in language and customs, and they inhabit the Provinces of Kiev, Kharkov, Tchernigov, Poltava, Podolia, and Volhynia, and they are also found outside the Empire of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, in Galicia, Bukovina, and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> (see below, section VI). The Great <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russians</a> may be regarded as the norm of the Russian people. Their language became the language of the court and of literature, just as High German and <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscan</a> Italian did, and they form the overwhelming majority of the inhabitants of the Russian Empire. They are practically all Eastern Orthodox, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> being Poles or Germans where they are of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, and Little Russians (<a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>) where they are of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russians</a> have long been settled in America, for <a href="../cathen/01246b.htm">Alaska</a> was Russian territory before it was purchased by the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in 1867. The Russian Orthodox church has been on American soil since the early nineteenth century. The immigration from <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> is however composed of very few Russians. It is principally made up of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (Russian and Polish), Poles, and <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuanians</a>. Out of an average emigration of from 250,000 to 260,000 annually from the Russian Empire to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, 65 percent have been <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and only from three to five percent actual Russians. Nevertheless the Russian peasant and <a href="../cathen/08719a.htm">working</a> class are active emigrants, and the exodus from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> is relatively large. But it is directed eastward instead of to the west, for <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> is intent upon settling up her vast prairie lands in <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a>. Hinderances are placed in the way of those Russians (except the Hews) who would leave for America or the west of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, while inducements and advantages are offered for settlers in <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a>. For the past five years about 500,000 Russians have annually migrated to <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a>, a number equal to one-half the immigrants yearly received by the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> from all sources. They go in great colonies and are aided by the Russian Government by grants of land, loans of money, and low transportation. New towns and cities have sprung up all over Siberia, which are not even on our maps, thus rivalling the American settlement of the Dakotas and the North West. Many Russians religious colonists, other than the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, have come to America; but often they are not wholly of <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> blood or are Little Russians (Ruthenians). It therefore happens that there are very few Russians in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> as compared with other nationalities. There are, according to the latest estimates, about 75,000, chiefly in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> and the Middle West. There has been a Russian colony in <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a> for sixty years, and they are numerous in and around New York City.

<p>The Russian <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> is well established here. About a third of the Russians in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> are opposed to it, being of the anti-government, semi-revolutionary type of immigrant. But the others are enthusiastic in support of their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and their national customs, yet their Church included not only them but the Little Russians of Bukovina and a very large number of Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Galicia and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> whom they have induced to leave the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and enter the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>. The Russian Church in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> is endowed by the tsar and the Holy Governing Synod, besides having the support of Russian missionary <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> at home, and is upon a flourishing financial basis in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. It now (1911) has 83 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> 15 in <a href="../cathen/01246b.htm">Alaska</a>, and 18 in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, making a total of 126 places of worship, besides a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Minneapolis and a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at South <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Canaan</a>, Pennsylvannia. Their present <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> is composed of one <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 6 proto-priests, 89 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 2 <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrites</a>, 2 hegumens, and 18 monastic <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, making a total of 119, while they also exercise <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the Serbian and Syrian Orthodox <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> besides. Lately they took over a Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sisterhood, and now have four <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> is now divided up into the following six districts of the Russian Church, intended to be the territory for future <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>: New York and the New England States, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> and the Atlantic States; Pittsburg and the Middle West; Western Pacific States; <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>; and Alaska. Their statistics of church population have not been published lately in their year-books, and much of their growth has been of late years by additions gained from the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> of Galicia and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and is due largely to the active and energetic work and financial support of the Russian church authorities at St. Petersburg and <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>.

<p>They have the "Russkoye Pravoslavnoye Obshestvo Vzaimopomoshchi" (Russian Orthodox Mutual Aid Society) for men, founded in 1895, now (1911) having 199 councils and 7072 members, and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women's</a> division of the same, founded in 1907, with 32 councils and 690 members. They publish two church papers, "America Orthodox Messenger", and "Svit"; although there are some nine other Russian papers published by <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Socialists.
<h2 id="section6">Ruthenians</h2>

<p>(<em>Rusin</em>; adjective <em>russky</em>, Ruthenian)

<p>These are the southern branch of the Russian <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, extending from the middle of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a> across the southern part of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. The use of the adjective <em>russky</em> by both the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> and the Russians permits it to be translated into English by the work "Ruthenian" or "Russian". They are also called Little Russians (<em>Malorossiani</em>) in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> itself, and sometimes <em>Russniaki</em> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. The appellations "Little Russians" and "Ruthenians" have come to have almost a technical meaning, the former indicating subjects of the Russian Empire who are of the Greek <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, and the latter those who are in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a> and are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>. Those who are active in the Panslavic movement and are Russo-philes are very anxious to have then called "Russians", no matter whence they come. The <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> are of the original Russo-Slavic race, and gave their name to the peoples making up the present Russian Empire. They are spread all over the southern part of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, in the provinces of Kiev, Kharkov, Tchernigogg, Poltava, and Podolia, and Volhynia (see above, V. RUSSIANS), but by force of governmental pressure and restrictive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> are being slowly made into Great <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russians</a>. Only within the past five years has the use of their own form of language and their own newspapers and press been allowed by law in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Nearly every <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> author in the empire has written his chief works in Great Russian, because denied the use of his own language. They are also spread throughout the Provinces of <a href="../cathen/09403a.htm">Lublin</a>, in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>; Galicia and Bukovina, in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>; and the Counties of <a href="../cathen/15761b.htm">Szepes</a>, Saros, Abauj, Zamplim, Ung, Marmos, and Bereg, in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. They have had an opportunity to develop in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and also in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. In the latter country they are closely allied with the Slovaks, and many of them speak the Slovak language. They are all of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, and with the exception of those in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and Bukovina are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. They use the Russian alphabet for their language, and in Bukovina and a portion of Galicia have a phonetic spelling, thus differing largely from Great Russian, even in words that are common to both.

<p>Their immigration to America commenced in 1880 as labourers in the coal mines of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, and has steadily increased ever since. Although they were the poorest of peasants and labourers, illiterate for the most part and unable to grasp the English language or American customs when they arrived, they have rapidly risen in the scale of prosperity and are now rivalling the other nationalities in progress. <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Greek Ruthenian</a> churches and institutions are being established upon a substantial basis, and their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are steadily advancing. They are scattered all over the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, and there are now (1911) between 489,000 and 500,000 of them, counting immigrants and native born. Their immigration for the past five years has been as follows: 1907, 24,081; 1908, 12,361; 1909, 15,808; 1910, 27,970; 1911, 17,724; being an average of 20,000 a year. They have chiefly settled in the <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">State of Pennsylvania</a>, over half of them being there; but <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, New York, <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">New Jersey</a>, and Illinois have large numbers of them. The <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> in the Slavonic language is firmly established through them in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> but they suffer greatly from Russian Orthodox endeavours to lead them from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as well as from frequent internal dissensions (chiefly of an old-world political nature) among themselves. They have 152 Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches, with a Greek <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> consisting of a Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who has his seat at Philadelphia, but without <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> powers as yet, and 127 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, of whom 9 are <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. During 1911 <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Order of St. Basil</a> were introduced. The <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> have flourishing religious mutual benefit <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, which also assist in the building of <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek</a> churches. The "Soyedineniya Greko-Katolicheskikh Bratstv" (Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Union) in its senior division has 509 members, brotherhoods or councils and 30,255 members, while the junior division has 226 brotherhoods and 15,200 members; the "Russky Narodny Soyus" (Ruthenian National Union) has 301 brotherhoods and 15,200 members; while the "Obshchestvo Russkikh Bratstv" (Society of Russian Brotherhood) has 129 brotherhoods and 7359 members. There are also many <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> who belong to Slovak organizations. The <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> publish some ten papers, of which the "Amerikansky Russky Vietnik", "Svododa", and "Dushpastyr" are the principal ones.
<h2 id="section7">Serbians</h2>

<p>(<em>Srbin</em>; adjective <em>srpski</em>, Serbian, or Servian)

<p>This designation applies not only to the inhabitants of the Kingdom of Serbia, but includes the people of the following countries forming a <a href="../cathen/06447a.htm">geographical</a> although not a political whole: southern <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, the Kingdoms of Serbia and <a href="../cathen/10529c.htm">Montenegro</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Provinces of Kossovo, Western <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>, and Novi-Bazar, and the annexed <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> provinces of <a href="../cathen/02694a.htm">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>. The last two provinces may be said to furnish the shadowy boundary line between the Croatians and the Serbians. The two peoples are ethnologically the same, and the Serbian and Croatian languages are merely two dialects of the same Slavonic tongue. Serbians are sometimes called the <em>Shtokavski</em>, because the Serbian word for "what" is <em>shto</em>, while the Croats use the word <em>cha</em> for "what", and Croatians are called <em>Chakavski</em>. The Croatians are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and use the Roman alphabet (<em>latinica</em>), whilst the Serbians are Eastern Orthodox and use the Cyrillic alphabet (<em>cirilica</em>), with additional signs to express special sounds not found in the Russian. Serbians who happen to be <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> are called <em>Bunjevaci</em> (disturbers, dissenters).

<p>Serbian immigration to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> did not commence until about 1892, when several hundred Montenegrins and Serbians came with the <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatians</a> and settled in <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>. It began to increase largely in 1903 and was at its highest in 1907. They are largely settled in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, and Illinois. There are no governmental statistics showing how many Serbians come from <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Serbia</a> and how many from the surrounding provinces. The <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Serbian</a> Government has established a special consular office in New York City to look after Serbian immigration. There are now (1911) about 150,000 Serbians in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. They are located as follows: New England States, 25,000; Middle Atlantic States, 50,000; Middle Western States, 25,000; Western and Pacific States, 25,000; and the remainder throughout the Southern States and Alaska. They have brought with them their Orthodox <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and are at present affiliated with the Russian <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> here although they expect shortly to have their own national <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. They now (1911) have in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> 20 churches (of which five are in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>) and 14 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, of whom 8 are <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and 6 seculars. They publish eight newspapers in Serbian, of which "Amerikanski Srbobran" of <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, "Srbobran" of New York, and "Srpski Glasnik" of <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a> are the most important. They have a large number of church and patriotic <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, of which the Serb Federation "Sloga" (Concord) with 131 <em>drustva</em> or council and over 10,000 members and "Prosvjeta" (Progress), composed of <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Serbians</a> from <a href="../cathen/02694a.htm">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, are the most prominent.
<h2 id="section8">Slovaks</h2>

<p>(<em>Slovak</em>; adjective <em>slovensky</em>, Slovak)

<p>These occupy the northwestern portion of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> upon the southern slopes of the Carpathian mountains, ranging over a territory comprising the Counties of Poszony, Nyitra, Bars, Hont, Z&oacute;lyom, Trencs&eacute;n, Turocz, Arva, Lipt&ouml;, <a href="../cathen/15761b.htm">Szepes</a>, S&aacute;ros, Zemplin, Ung, Abauj, G&ouml;m&ouml;r, and N&oacute;grad. A well-defined ethnical line is all that divides the Slovaks from the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> and the Magyars. Their language is almost the same as the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a>, for they received their literature and their mode of writing it from the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a>, and even now nearly all the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Slovak literature is from <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> sources. It must be remembered however that the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> and Moravians dwell on the northern side of the Carpathian mountains in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, whilst the Slovaks are on the south of the Carpathians and are wholly in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. Between the Moravians and the Slovaks, dwelling so near to one another, the relationship was especially close. The Slovak and Moravian people were among those who first heard the story of Christ from the Slavonic apostles Sts. Cyril and Methodius, and at one time their tribes must have extended down to the Danube and the southern <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>. The Magyars (Hungarians) came in from <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and the East, and like a wedge divided this group of northern <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> from those on the south.

<p>The Slovaks have had no independent history and have endured successively Polish rule, Magyar conquest, Tatar invasions, German invading colonization, Hussite raids from <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, and the dynastic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. In 1848-49, when revolution and rebellion were in the air, the Hungarians began their <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>; the Slovaks in turn rose against the Hungarians for the language and national customs, but on the conclusion of peace, they were again incorporated as part of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> without any of their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> recognized. Later they were ruthlessly put down when they refused to carry out the Hungarian decrees, particularly as they had rallied to the support of the Austrian throne. In 1861 the Slovaks presented their famous Memorandum to the Imperial Throne of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for a bill of <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and for their autonomous nationality. Stephen Moyses, the distinguished Slovak <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Bishop, besought the emperor to grant national and language <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to them. The whole movement awoke popular enthusiasm, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> working together for the common good. In 1862 high schools were opened for Slovaks; the famous "Slovenska Matica", to publish Slovak books and works of art and to foster the study of the Slovak history and language, was founded; and in 1870 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> also founded the "Society of St. Voytech", which became a powerful helper. Slovak newspapers sprang into existence and 150 reading clubs and <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> were established. After the defeat of the Austrian arms at Sadowa in 1866, pressure was resumed to split the empire into two parts, Austrian and Hungarian, each of which was practically independent. The Slovaks thenceforth came wholly under Hungarian rule. Then the Law of Nationalities was passed which recognized the predominant position of the Magyars, but gave some small recognition to the other minor nationalities, such as the Slovaks, by allowing them to have churches and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> conducted in their own language.

<p>In 1878 the active Magyarization of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> was undertaken. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was mooted that a native of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> could not be a patriot unless he spoke, thought, and felt as a Magyar. A Slovak of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> who remained true to his ancestry (and it must be remembered that the Slovaks were there long before the Hungarians came) was considered deficient in patriotism. The most advanced political view was that a compromise with the Slovaks was impossible; that there was but one expedient, to wipe them out as far as possible by assimilation with the Magyars. Slovak <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and institutions were ordered to be closed, the charter of the "Matica" was annulled, and its <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> and rich historical and artistic collections, as well as its funds, were confiscated. Inequalities of every kind before the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> were devised for the undoing of the Slovaks and turning them into <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungarians</a>; so much so that one of their authors likened them to the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> in their troubles. The Hungarian authorities in their endeavour to suppress the Slovak nationality went even to the extent of taking away Slovak children to be brought up as Magyars, and forbade them to use their language in <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and church. The 2,000,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Slovaks clung to their language and <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> customs, but the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in their <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> through the medium of the Magyar tongue and required in their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> to conform to the state <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. Among the 750,000 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Slovaks the Government went even further by taking control of their <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Even Slovak <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> names were changed to Hungarian ones, and preference was only through Hungarians channels. Naturally, religion decayed under the stress and strain of repressed nationality. Slovak <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> did not perform their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> with ardour or diligence, but confined themselves to the mere routine of canonical <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. There are no <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> or <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders among the Slovaks and no provision is made for any kind of community life. Catechetical instruction is at a minimum and is required to be given whenever possible through the medium of the Hungarian language. There is no lack of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the Slovak country, yet the practice of solemnizing the reception of the first <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">communion</a> by the children is unknown and many other forms of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> devotion are omitted. Even the <a href="../cathen/13188b.htm">Holy Rosary Society</a> was dissolved, because its devotions and proceedings and devotions were conducted in Slovak. The result of governmental restriction of any national expression has been a complete lack of initiative on the part of the Slovak <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and it is needless to speak of the result upon their flocks. In the eastern part of the Slovak territory where there were Slovak-speaking Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, they fared slightly better in regard to the attempts to make them Hungarians. There the liturgy was Slavonic and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who used the Magyar tongue still were in close touch with their people through the offices of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. All this pressure on the part of the authorities tended to produce an active Slovak emigration to America, while bad harvests and taxation also contributed.

<p>A few immigrants came to America in 1864 and their success brought others. In the late seventies the Slovak exodus was well marked, and by 1882 it was sufficiently important to be investigated by the Hungarian Minister of the Interior and directions given to repress it. The American immigration figures indicated the first important Slovak influx in 1873 when 1300 immigrants came from <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, which rose to 4000 in 1880 and to nearly 15,000 in 1884, most of them settling in the mining and industrial regions of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. At first they came from the Counties of Zemplin, Saros, <a href="../cathen/15761b.htm">Szepes</a>, and Ung, where there were also many <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>. They were called "Huns" or "Hankies", and were used at first to fill the places left vacant by strikers. They were very poor and willing to work for little when they arrived, and were accordingly <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by the members of the various unions. The Slovak girls, like the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, mostly went into service, and because they had almost no expense for living managed to earn more than the men. Today the Slovaks of America are beginning to possess a national culture and organization, which presents a striking contrast to the cramped development of their kinsmen in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. Their immigration of late years has ranged annually from 52,368 in 1905 to 33,416 in 1910. Altogether it is estimated that there are now some 560,000 Slovaks in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> including the native born. They are spread throughout the country, chiefly in the following states: <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, 270,000; <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, 75,000; Illinois, 50,000; New Jersey, 50,000; New York, 35,000; Connecticut, 20,000; <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, 15,000; Missouri, 10,000; whilst they range from 5000 to a few hundreds in the other states. About 450,000 of them are Latin-Rite <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 10,000 Byzantine-Rite <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and 95,000 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>.

<p>The first Slovak <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was founded by Rev. Joseph Kossalko at Streator, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, and was dedicated 8 Dec., 1883. Following this he also built St. Joseph's Church at Hazleton, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, in 1884. In 1889 Rev. Stephen Furdek founded the Church of St. Ladislas at <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, together with a fine <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, both of which were dedicated by Bishop Gilmour. The American <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were anxious to get Slovak <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for the increasing immigration, and Bishop Gilmour sent Father Furdek to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> for that purpose. The Hungarian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were unwilling to send Slovak <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at first, but as immigration increased they acceded to the request. At present (1911) the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Slovaks have a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> consisting of one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (Rt. Rev. J.M. Koudelka) and 104 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and have '34 churches situated as follows: in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, 81 (Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/01368a.htm">Altoona</a>, 10; Erie, 4; Harrisburg, 3; Philadelphia, 15; Pittsburg, 35; and Scranton, 14); in <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, 14 (in the <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Diocese of Cleveland</a>, 12; and <a href="../cathen/04149a.htm">Columbus</a>, 2); in <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, 10 (in the Arch-diocese of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, 7; and Peoria, 3); in New Jersey 11 (in the <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Diocese of Newark</a>, 7; and <a href="../cathen/15037a.htm">Trenton</a>, 4); in New York, 6; and in the States of Connecticut, 3; <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, 2; <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, 2; and Minnesota, <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, <a href="../cathen/01240a.htm">Alabama</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15605a.htm">West Virginia</a>, one each. Some of the Slovak church buildings are very fine specimens of church architecture. There are also 36 Slovak <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, that of Our Lady Mary in Cleveland having 750 pupils. They have also introduced and American order of Slovak <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, the Sisters of Saints Cyril and Methodius, who are established under the direction of Bishop Hoban in the <a href="../cathen/13633a.htm">Diocese of Scranton</a>, where they have four <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Slovaks followed the example of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and established their first church at Streator, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, in 1885, and later founded a church at Minneapolis in 1888, and from 1890 to 1894 three churches in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. They now have in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> 60 Slovak churches and congregations (of which 28 are in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>), with 34 <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> (not including some 5 <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a>), who are organized under the name of "The Slovak Evangelical Lutheran Synod of America". The Slovaks have a large number of organizations. The principal <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ones are: Prva Katok&iacute;cka Slovensk&aacute; Jednota (First Slovak <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Union), for men, 33,000 members; Pennsylv&aacute;nska Slovensk&aacute; Rimsko a Gr&eacute;cko Katol&iacute;cka Jednota (Pennsylvania Slovak Roman and Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Union), 7500 members; Prva Katol&iacute;cka Slovensk&aacute; Zensk&aacute; Jednota (First <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Slovak Women's Union), 12,000 members; Pennsylv&aacute;nska Slovensk&aacute; Zensk&aacute; Jednota (Pennsylvania Slovak Women's Union), 3500 members; Zivena (Women's League), 6000 members. There are also: N&aacute;rodny Slovensky Spolok (National Slovak Society), which takes in all Slovaks except <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, 28,000 members; Evanjel&iacute;cka Slovensk&aacute; Jednota (Evangelical Lutheran Slovak Union), 8000 members; Kalvinsk&aacute; Slovensk&aacute; Jednota (Presbyterian Slovak Union), 1000 members; Neodvisly N&aacute;rodny Slovensky Spolok (Independent National Slovak Society), 2000 members. They also have a large and enterprising Press, publishing some fourteen papers. The chief ones are: "Slovensky Denn&iacute;k" (Slovak Journal), a daily, of <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>; "Slovak v Amerike" (Slovak in America), of New York; "Narodne Noviny" (National News), a weekly, of <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, with 38,000 circulation; "Jednota" (The Union), also a weekly, of Middleton, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, with 35,000 circulation; and "Bratstvo" (Brotherhood) of Wilkes-Barre, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. There are also <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> and Socialistic journals, whose circulation is small. Among the distinguished Slovaks in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> may be mentioned Rev. Joseph Murgas of Wilkes-Barre, who, in addition to his work among his people, has perfected several inventions in wireless telegraphy and is favourably known in other scientific matters.
<h2 id="section9">Slovenes</h2>

<p>(<em>Slovenec</em>; adjective <em>slovenski</em>, Slovenian)

<p>These come chiefly from southwestern <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, from the Provinces of Carniola (Kranjsko; Ger., Krain), Carinthia (<em>Kransjsko</em>; Ger., <em>K&auml;rnten</em>), and Styria (<em>Krain</em>; Ger., <em>Steiermark</em>); as well as from Resia (<em>Resja</em>) and <a href="../cathen/15118a.htm">Udine</a> (<em>Videm</em>) in northeastern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and the Coast Lands (<em>Primorsko</em>) of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a>. Their neighbours on the southwest are <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>; on the west and north, Germans; on the east, Germans and Magyars; and towards the south, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> and Croatians. Most of them are bilingual, speaking not only the Slovenian but also the <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German language</a>. For this reason they are not so readily distinguishable in America as the other <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, and have less trouble in assimilating themselves. At home the main centres of their language and literature have been <a href="../cathen/08743a.htm">Laibach</a> (Ljubljana), Klagenfurt (Celovec), Graz (Gradec), and <a href="../cathen/06654b.htm">G&ouml;rz (Gorica)</a>, the latter city being also largely Italian. In America they are more often known as "Krainer", that being the German adjective of <a href="../cathen/08696a.htm">Krain</a> (Carniola), from whence the larger number of them come to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>; sometimes the word has even been mispronounced and set down as "Griner". The Slovenes became known somewhat early in the history of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. <a href="../cathen/02282b.htm">Father Frederic Baraga</a> was among the first of them to come here in 1830, and began his missionary work as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> among the Indians of Michigan, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, and Minnesota, and finally became the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09689a.htm">Marquette</a>, Michigan. He studied the Indian languages and wrote their grammars and history in his various English, German, and Slovenian works. He also published several catechisms and religious works in Slovenian, and brought over several other Slovenian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.

<p>In Calumet, <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, the Slovenes settled as early as 1856; they first appeared in <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> and in <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a> about 1863, and in 1866 they founded their chief farming colony in Brockway, Minnesota. Here they still preserve their own language and all their minute local peculiarities. They came to Omaha in 1868, and in 1873 their present large colony in Joliet, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, was founded. Their earliest settlement in New York was towards the end of 1878, and gradually their numbers have increased until they have churches in Haverstraw and Rockland Lake, where their language is used. They have also established farm settlements in <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>, <a href="../cathen/14160a.htm">South Dakota</a>, <a href="../cathen/07627a.htm">Idaho</a>, Washington, and in additional places in <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>. Their very active immigration began in 1892, and has been (1990-1910) at the rate of from 6000 to 9000 annually, but has lately fallen off. The official government statistics class them along with the Croatians. There are now (1911) in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> a little over 120,000 Slovenes; practically all of them are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and with no great differences or factions among them. There is a leaning towards Socialism in the large mining and manufacturing centres. In <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> there are about 30,000; in <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, 15,000; in <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, 12,000; in <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, 8000; in <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>, 12,000; in <a href="../cathen/04129a.htm">Colorado</a>, 10,000; in Washington, 10,000; in <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">Montana</a>, 5000; and in fact there are Slovenes reported in almost every state and territory except Georgia. Their immigration was caused by the poverty of the people at home, especially as Carniola is a rocky and mountainous district without much fertility, and neglected even from the times of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. Latterly the institution of Raffeisen banks, debt-paying and mutual aid associations introduced among the people by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party (Slovenska Ljudska Stranka), has diminished immigration and enabled them to live more comfortably at home.

<p>The Slovenes are noted for their adaptability, and have given many prominent missionary leaders to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Among them are <a href="../cathen/02282b.htm">Bishop Baraga</a>, <a href="../cathen/10624d.htm">Mrak</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15377b.htm">Vertin</a> (of Marquette), Stariha (of <a href="../cathen/09098a.htm">Lead</a>), and Trobec (of St. Cloud); Monsignori Stibil, Buh, and Plut; Abbot Bernard Locnika, O.S.B.; and many others. There are some 92 Slovenian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and twenty-five Slovenian churches. Many of their churches are quite fine, especially st.Joseph's, Joliet, Illinois; St. Joseph's, Calumet, Michigan; and Sts.Cyril and Methodius, Sheboygan, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>. There are also mixed <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> where the Slovenes are united with other nationalities, usually with <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a>, Slovaks, or Germans. There are no exclusively Slovenian <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities. At St. John's, <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>, there are six Slovenian <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, and at Rockland Lake, New York, three Slovenian <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, who are undertaking to establish a Slovenian and Croatian community. From them much of the information herein has been obtained. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> at Joliet, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, have many Slovenian sisters; at <a href="../cathen/08602a.htm">Kansas City</a>, <a href="../cathen/08597a.htm">Kansas</a>, there are several Slovenian sisters engaged in <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> work; and there are some Slovenians among the Notre Dame Sisters of <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. Archbishop Ireland of <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>, sent to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> for Slovenian seminarians to finish their <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> here, and also appointed three Slovenian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are professors in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, thus providing a Slovenian- American <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> for their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in his province.

<p>There are several church and benevolent organizations among the Slovenians in America. The principal ones are: Kranjsko Slovenska Katoliska Jednota (Krainer Slovenian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Union), organized in April, 1894, now having 100 councils and a membership of 12,000; Jugoslovenska Katoliska Jednota (South Slovenian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Union), organized in Jan., 1901, having 90 councils and 8000 members; besides these there are also Slovenska Zapadna Zveza (Slovenian Western Union), with 30 councils and about 3000 members, Drustva Sv. Barbara (St. Barbara Society), with 80 councils, chiefly among miners, and the semi-socialistic Delvaska Podporna Zveza (Workingmen's Benevolent Union) with 25 councils and a considerable membership. There are also Sv. Rafaelova Druzba (St. Raphael's Society), to assist Slovenian immigrants founded by Father Kasimir, O.F.M., and the Society of Sts. Cyril and Methodius to assist Slovenian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, as well as numerous singing and gymnastic organizations. The Slovenians publish ten newspapers in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The oldest is the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> weekly "Amerikanski Slovenec" (American Slovene), established in 1891 at Joliet, and it is the organ of the Krainer Slovenian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Union. "Glas Naroda" (Voice of the People), established in 1892 in New York City, is a daily paper somewhat Liberal in its views, but it is the official organ of the South Slavonic <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Union and the <a href="../cathen/02284d.htm">St. Barbara</a> Society. "Ave Maria" is a religious monthly published by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> of Rockland Lake, New York. "Glasnik" (The Herald) is a weekly of Calumet, Michigan; as are "Edinost" (Unity), of <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>; "Clevelandska Amerika", of <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>; "Narodni Vestnik" (People's Messenger), of <a href="../cathen/05188c.htm">Duluth </a>, Minnesota; and "Slovenski Narod" (Slovenian People), of Pueblo, <a href="../cathen/04129a.htm">Colorado</a>. There are also two purely Socialistic weeklies in <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>: "Proletarec" (Proletarian) and "Glas Svobode" (Voice of Freedom).
