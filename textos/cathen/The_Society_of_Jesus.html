<p>(Company of Jesus, Jesuits)

<p>The Society of Jesus is a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order founded by <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">Saint Ignatius Loyola</a>. Designated by him "The Company of Jesus" to indicate its true leader and its soldier spirit, the title was Latinized into "Societas Jesu" in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> approving its formation and the first formula of its Institute ("Regimini militantis ecclesia", 27 Sept., 1540). The term "Jesuit" (of fifteenth-century origin, meaning one who used too frequently or appropriated the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of Jesus</a>), was first applied to the society in reproach (1544-52), and was never employed by its founder, though members and friends of the society in time accepted the name in its good sense. The Society ranks among religious institutes as a <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant order</a> of clerks regular, that is, a body of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> organized for apostolic work, following a religious rule, and relying on <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> for their support [<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>, "Dum indefessae", 7 July, 1571; <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>, <a href="../cathen/01766d.htm">"Ascendente Domino"</a>, 25 May, 1585].

<p>As has been explained under the title <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">"Ignatius Loyola"</a>, the founder began his self-reform, and the enlistment of followers, entirely prepossessed with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the imitation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and without any plan for a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order or purpose of attending to the needs of the days. Unexpectedly prevented from carrying out this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, he offered his services and those of this followers to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, "Christ upon Earth", who at once employed him in such works as were most pressing at the moment. It was only after this and just before the first companions broke to go at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> command to various countries, that the resolution to found an order was taken, and that Ignatius was commissioned to draw up Constitutions. This he did slowly and methodically; first introducing rules and customs and seeing how they worked. He did not codify them for the first six years. Then three years were given to formulating <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> the wisdom of which had been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proven</a> by experiment. In the last six years of the Saint's life the Constitutions so composed were finally revised and put into practice everywhere. This sequence of events explains at once how the society, though devoted to the following of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as though there were nothing else in the world to care for, is also excellently adapted to the needs of the day. It began to attend to them before it began to legislate; and its legislation was the codification of those measures which had been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by experience to be apt to preserve its preliminary religious principle among men actually devoted to the requirements of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in days not unlike our own.

<p>The Society was not founded with the avowed intention of opposing <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. Neither the <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">papal letters</a> of <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> nor the Constitutions of the order mention this as the object of the new foundation. When Ignatius began to devote himself to the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he had probably not even heard of the names of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant Reformers</a>. His early plan was rather the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> which, a few decades after the final triumph of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> over the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, must have strongly appealed to the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">chivalrous</a> <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>.

<p>The name "Societas Jesu" had been born by a <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military order</a> approved and recommended by <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> in 1450, the purpose of which was to fight against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and aid in spreading the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a>. The early Jesuits were sent by Ignatius first to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> lands or to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries; to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> countries only at the special request of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the cradle-land of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, at the urgent solicitation of the imperial ambassador.

<p>From the very beginning the missionary labours of the Jesuits among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, Central and South America were as important as their activity in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> countries. As the object of the society was the propagation and strengthening of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> everywhere, the Jesuits naturally endeavored to counteract the spread of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. They became the main instruments of the <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a>; the re-conquest of southern and western <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and other countries were due chiefly to their exertions.
<h2>Institutes, constitutions, legislation</h2>

<p>The official publication which constitutes all the regulations of the Society, its <em>codex legum</em>, is entitled "Institutum Societas Jesu" of which the latest edition was issued at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Florence 1869-91 (for full biography see Sommervogel, V, 75-115; IX, 609-611; for commentators see X, 705-710). The Institute contains:

<p>(1) The special <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> and other pontifical documents approving the Society and canonically determining or regulating its various works, and its <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> standing and relations.

<p>Besides those already mentioned, other important <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> are those of: <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, "Injunctum nobis", 14 March, 1543; <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a>, "Exposcit debitum", 21 July, 1550; <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>, "&AElig;quum reputamus", 17 January, 1565; <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, "Solicitudo omnium ecclesiarum", 7 August, 1814, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, "Dolemus inter alia", 13 July, 1880.

<p>(2) The Examen Generale and Constitutions. The Examen contains subjects to be explained to <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a> and points on which they are to be examined. The Constitutions are divided into ten parts: <ol><li>admission; <li>dismissal; <li>novitiate; <li>scholastic training; <li>profession and other grades of membership; <li>religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and other <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> as observed by the Society; <li>missions and other ministries; <li>congregations, local and general assemblies as a means of union and uniformity; <li>the general and chief superiors; <li>the preservation of the spirit of the Society.</ol>

<p>Thus far in the Institute all is by <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">Saint Ignatius</a>, who has also added "Declarations" of various obscure parts. Then come:
<ul><li>Decrees of General Congregations, which have equal authority with the Constitutions; <li>Rules, general and particular, etc.; <li>Formulae or order of business for the congregations; <li>Ordinations of generals, which have the same authority as rules; <li>Instructions, some for superiors, others for those engaged in the missions or other works of the Society; <li>Industriae, or special counsels for superiors; <li>The Book of the Spiritual; and <li>the <a href="../cathen/12654a.htm">Ratio Studiorum</a>, which have directive force only.</ul>

<p>The Constitutions as drafted by Ignatius and adopted finally by the first congregation of the Society, 1558, have never been altered. Ill-informed writers have stated that <a href="../cathen/08747a.htm">Lainez</a>, the second general, made considerable changes in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> conception of the order; but Ignatius' own later recension of the Constitutions, lately reproduced in facsimile (Rome, 1908), exactly agree with the text of the Constitutions now in force, and contains no word by <a href="../cathen/08747a.htm">Lainez</a>, not even in the declarations, or <a href="../cathen/06588a.htm">glosses</a> added to the text, which are all the work of Ignatius. The text in use in the Society is a Latin version prepared under the direction of the third congregation, and subjected to a minute comparison with the Spanish original preserved in the Society's archives, during the fourth congregation (1581).

<p>These Constitutions were written after long deliberation between Ignatius and his companions in the founding of the Society, as at first it seemed to them that they might continue their work without the aid of a special Rule. They were the fruit of long experience and of serious meditation and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Throughout they are inspired by an exalted spirit of charity and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p>They contain nothing unreasonable. To appreciate them, however, requires a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of canon law applied to <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">monastic life</a> and also of their history in the light of the times for which they were framed. Usually those who find fault with them either have never read them or else have misinterpreted them. Monod, for instance, in his introduction to B&ouml;hmer's essay on the Jesuits ("Les jesuites", Paris, 1910, p. 13, 14) recalls how Michelet mistranslated the words of the Constitutions, p. VI, c. 5, <em>obligationem ad peccatum</em>, and made it appear that they require obedience even to the commission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as if the text were <em>obligatio ad peccandum</em>, where the obvious meaning and purpose of the text is precisely to show that the transgression of the rules is not in itself <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Monod enumerates such men as <a href="../cathen/01742a.htm">Arnauld</a>, Wolf, Lange, Ranke in the first edition of his "History", Hausser and Droysen, Philippson and Charbonnel, as having repeated the same <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, although it has been refuted frequently since 1824, particularly by Gieseler, and corrected by Ranke in his second edition.

<p>Whenever the Constitutions enjoin what is already a serious <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, or superiors, by virtue of their authority, impose a grave <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, transgression is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>; but this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of such transgressions not only in the society but out of it. Moreover such commands are rarely given by the superiors and only when the good of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> member or the common good imperatively demands it. The rule throughout is one of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> inspired by wisdom, and must be interpreted in the spirit of charity which animates it. This is especially <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of its provisions for the affectionate relations of members with superiors and with one another, by the <a href="../cathen/09597a.htm">manifestation of conscience</a>, more or less practiced in every <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, and by <a href="../cathen/04394a.htm">mutual correction</a> when this may be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. It also applies to the methods employed to ascertain the qualification of members for various offices or ministries.


<p>The chief authority is vested in the general congregation, which elects the general, and could, for certain grave causes, <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">depose</a> him. This body could also (although there has never yet been an occasion for so doing) add new Constitutions and abrogate old ones. Usually this congregation is convened on the occasion of the death of a general, in order to <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> a successor, and to make provisions for the government and welfare of the Society. It may also be called at other times for grave reasons. It consists of the general, when alive, and his assistants, the provincials, and two deputies from each province or territorial division of the society elected by the superiors and older <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">professed</a> members.

<p>Thus authority in the Society eventually rests on a democratic basis. But as there is no definite <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> for calling the general congregation &mdash; which in fact rarely occurs except to <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> a new general &mdash; the exercise of authority is usually in the hands of the general, in whom is vested the fullness of administrative power, and of spiritual authority. He can do anything within the scope of the Constitutions, and can even dispense with them for good causes, though he cannot change them. He resides at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and has a council of assistants, five in number at present, one each for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and the countries of Spanish origin, one for <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, and one for English-speaking countries &mdash; <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and British colonies (except <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>). These usually hold office until the death of the general. Should the general through age or infirmity become incapacitated for governing the Society, a <a href="../cathen/15401a.htm">vicar</a> is chosen by a general congregation to act for him. At his death he names one so to act until the congregation can meet and <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> his successor.

<p>Next to him in order of authority comes the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincials</a>, the heads of the Society, whether for an entire country, as <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, Mexico, or, where these units are too large or too small to make convenient provinces they may be subdivided or joined together. Thus there are now four provinces in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>: <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>-New York, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>. In all there are now twenty-seven provinces. The provincial is appointed by the general, with ample administrative <a href="../cathen/05749a.htm">faculties</a>. He too has a council of "counselors" and an "admonitor" appointed by the general. Under the provincial come the local superiors. Of these, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rectors</a> of <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a>, <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provosts</a> of professed houses, and masters of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> are appointed by the general; the rest by the provincial. To enable the general to make and control so many appointments, a free and ample correspondence is kept up, and everyone has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of private communication with him. No superior, except the general, is named for life. Usually <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincials</a> and <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rectors</a> of <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a> hold office for three years.

<p>Members of the society fall into four classes: <ul><li><em>Novices</em> (whether received as <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> for the domestic and temporal services of the order, or as aspirants to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>), who are trained in the spirit and discipline of the order, prior to making the religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. <li>At the end of two years the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> make simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and, if aspirants to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, become <em>formed scholastics</em>; they remain in this grade as a rule from two to fifteen years, in which time they will have completed all their studies, pass (generally) a certain period in teaching, receive the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and go through a third year of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> or probation (the tertianship). According to the degree of discipline and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and to the talents they display (the latter are normally tested by the <a href="../cathen/05673a.htm">examination</a> for the Degree of Doctor of Theology) they may now become formed coadjutors or professed members of the order. <li><em>Formed coadjutors</em>, whether formed <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, make <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> which, though not <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a>, are perpetual on their part; while the Society, on its side binds itself to them, unless they should commit some grave offense. <li>The <em>professed</em> are all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who make, besides the three usual <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of religion, a fourth, of special obedience to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the matter of missions, undertaking to go wherever they are sent, without even requiring money for the journey. They also make certain additional, but non-essential, simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, in the matter of poverty, and the refusal of external <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honours</a>. The professed of the four <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> constitute the kernel of the Society; the other grades are regarded as preparatory, or as subsidiary to this. The chief offices can be held by the professed alone; and though they may be dismissed, they must be received back, if willing to comply with the conditions that may be prescribed. Otherwise they enjoy no <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privileges</a>, and many posts of importance, such as the government of <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a>, may be held by members of other grades. For special reasons some are occasionally professed of three <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and they have certain but not all the <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privileges</a> of the other professed.</ul>

<p>All live in community alike, as regards food, apparel, lodging, recreation, and all are alike bound by the rules of the Society.

<p>There are no secret Jesuits. Like other orders, the Society can, if it will, make its friends participators in its <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of its good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>; but it cannot make them members of the order, unless they live the life of the order. There is indeed the case of <a href="../cathen/06213a.htm">St. Francis Borgia</a>, who made some of the probations in an unusual way, outside the houses of the order. But this was in order that he might be able to conclude certain business matters and other affairs of state, and thus appear the sooner in public as a Jesuit, not that he might remain permanently outside the common life.
<h3>Novitiate and training</h3>

<p>Candidates for admission come not only from the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a> conducted by the Society, but from other <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Frequently post-graduate or professional students, and those who have already begun their career in business or professional life, or even in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, apply for admission. Usually the candidate applies in person to the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a>, and if he considers him a likely subject he refers him for <a href="../cathen/05673a.htm">examination</a> to four of the more experienced <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">fathers</a>. They question him about the age, health, position, occupation of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, their religion and good <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>, their dependence on his services; about his own health, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> such as <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a>, or other <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contractual</a> relations; his studies, qualifications, <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>, personal motives as well as the external influences that may have lead him to seek admission. The results of their questioning and of their own observation they report severally to the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a>, who weighs their opinions carefully before deciding for or against the applicant. Any notable bodily or <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> defect in the candidate, serious <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">indebtedness</a> or other <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, previous membership in another <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order even for a day, indicating instability of <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">vocation</a>, unqualifies for admission. Undue influence, particularly if exercised by members of the order, would occasion stricter scrutiny than usual into the personal motives of the applicant.

<p>Candidates may enter at any <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, but usually there is a fixed day each years for their admission, toward the close of the summer holidays, in order that all may begin their training, or probation, together. They spend the first ten days considering the manner of life they are to adopt, and its difficulties, the rules of the order, the obedience required of its members. They then make a brief <a href="../cathen/12795b.htm">retreat</a>, meditating on what they have learned about the Society and examining their own motives and hopes for perserverance in the new mode of life. If all be satisfactory to them and to the superior or director who has charge of them, they are admitted as <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, wear the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> costume (as there is no special Jesuit habit) and begin in earnest the life of members in the Society. They rise early, make a brief visit to the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, a meditation on some subject selected the night before, assist at Mass, review their meditation, breakfast, and then prepare for the day's routine. This consists of manual labor in or out of doors, reading books on spiritual topics, <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>, biography, particularly of men or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> distinguished for <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and enterprise in missionary or <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> fields. There is a daily conference by the master of the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> on some detail of the Institute, notes of which all are required to make, so as to be ready, when asked, to repeat the salient points.

<p>Wherever it is possible some are submitted to certain tests of their <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">vocation</a> or usefulness; to teaching <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> in the village churches; to attendance on the sick in <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>; to going about on a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> or missionary journey without money or other provision. As soon as possible, all make the spiritual exercises for 30 days. This is really the chief test of a <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">vocation</a>, as it is also in epitome the main work of the two years of the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, and for that matter of the entire life of a Jesuit. On these exercises the Constitutions, the life, and activity of the Society are based, so they are really the chief factor in forming the <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> of a Jesuit.

<p>In accordance with the ideals set forth in these exercises, of disinterested conformity with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will, and of personal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> is trained diligently in the meditative study of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of religion, in the habit of self-knowledge, in the constant scrutiny of his motives and of the actions inspired by them, in the correction of every form of self-deceit, illusion, plausible pretext, and in the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of his will, particularly in making choice of what seems best after careful deliberation and without self-seeking. Deeds, not words, are insisted upon as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of genuine service, and a mechanical, emotional, or fanciful <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> is not tolerated. As the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> gradually thus becomes master of his will, he grows more and more capable of offering to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the reasonable service enjoined by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, and seeks to follow the divine will, as manifested in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, by His <a href="../cathen/15403b.htm">vicar on earth</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> appointed to rule His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, by his more immediate or religious superiors, and by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil powers</a> rightfully exercising authority. This is what is meant by Jesuit obedience, the characteristic virtue of the order, such a sincere respect for authority as to accept its decisions and comply with them, not merely by outward performance but in all sincerity with the conviction that compliance is best, and that the command expresses for the time the will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as nearly as it can be ascertained.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">noviceship</a> lasts two years. On its completion the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> makes the usual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of religion, the simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> in the Society having the force of a diriment <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediment</a> to <a href="../cathen/09691b.htm">matrimony</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">noviceship</a> but a brief time daily is devoted to reviewing previous studies. The <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">noviceship</a> over, the scholastic members, i.e., those who are to become <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the Society, follow a special course in classics and mathematics lasting two years, usually in the same house with the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>. Then, in another house and neighbourhood, three years are given to the study of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, about five years to teaching in one or other of the public <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a> of the Society, four years to the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> orders being conferred after the third, and finally, one year more to another probation or <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">noviceship</a>, intended to help the young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> renew his spirit of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and to learn how to utilize to the best of his ability all the learning and experience he has required. In exceptional cases, as in that of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who has finished his studies before entering the order, allowance is made and the training periods need not last over ten years, a good part of which is spent in active ministry.

<p>The object of the order is not limited to practicing any one class of good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, however laudable (as preaching, <a href="../cathen/09304a.htm">chanting</a> <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">office</a>, doing penance, etc.), but to study, in the manner of the Spiritual, what <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would have done, if He were living in our circumstances, and to carry out that ideal. Hence elevation and largeness of aim. Hence the motto of the Society, "Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam". Hence the selection of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of obedience as the characteristic of the order, to be ready for any call, and to keep unity in every variety of work. Hence, by easy sequence, the omission of <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">office</a> in choir, of a special distinctive habit, of unusual <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penances</a>. Where the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> reformers aimed at reorganizing the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> at large according to their particular conceptions, Ignatius began with interior self-reform; and after that had been thoroughly established, then the earnest preaching of self-reform to others. That done, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> would not, and did not, fail to reform herself. Many religious distinguished themselves as educators before the Jesuits; but the Society was the first order which enjoined by its very Constitutions devotion to the cause of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. It was, in this sense, the first "teaching order".

<p>The ministry of the Society consists chiefly in preaching; teaching <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>, especially to children; administering the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> especially penance and the Eucharist; conducting <a href="../cathen/10391a.htm">missions in the parishes</a> on the lines of the Spiritual; directing those who wish to follow those exercises in houses of <a href="../cathen/12795b.htm">retreat</a>, <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>; taking care of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> or <a href="../cathen/04114a.htm">collegiate</a> churches; organizing <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">confraternities</a>, sodalities, <a href="../cathen/15154a.htm">unions of prayer</a>, <a href="../cathen/02648a.htm">Bona Mors associations</a> in their own and other <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; teaching in <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of every grade &mdash; academic; <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>; writing books, pamphlets, periodical articles; going on foreign missions among uncivilized peoples.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> functions the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> is followed. The proper exercise of all these functions is provided for by rules carefully framed by the general congregations or by the generals. All these regulations command the greatest respect on the part of every member. In practice the superior for the time being is the living rule &mdash; not that he can alter or abrogate any rule, but because he must interpret and determine its application. In this fact and in its consequences, the Society differs from every <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order antecedent to its foundation; to this principally, it owes its life, activity, and power to adapt its Institutes to modern <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> without need of change in that instrument or of reform in the body itself.

<p>The story of the foundation of the Society is told in the article <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">Ignatius Loyola</a>. Briefly, after having inspired his companions <a href="../cathen/11767a.htm">Peter Faber</a>, <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">Francis Xavier</a>, <a href="../cathen/08747a.htm">James Lainez</a>, <a href="../cathen/13402b.htm">Alonso Salmer&oacute;n</a>, <a href="../cathen/02605a.htm">Nicolas Bobadilla</a>, Simon Rodriquez, Claude Le Jay, Jean Codure, and Paschase Brouet with a desire to dwell in the Holy Land imitating the life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they first made <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of poverty and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> at Montmartre, Paris, on 15 August, 1534, adding a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to go to the Holy Land after two years. When this was found to be inpracticable, after waiting another year, they offered their services to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>. Fully another year was passed by some in <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> towns in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, by others at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where, after encountering much opposition and <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a>, all met together to agree on a mode of life by which they might advance in <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">evangelical perfection</a> and help others in the same task. The first formula of the Institute was submitted to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and approved of viva voce, 3 September 1539, and formally, 27 September, 1540.
