<h1>The Society of the Blessed Sacrament</h1>  

<p>A congregation of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> founded by <a href="../cathen/05735b.htm">Venerable Pierre-Julien Eymard</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1 June, 1856. His aim was to create a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> whose members should devote themselves exclusively to the worship of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> approved the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> by Briefs of 1856 and 1858 and by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 3 June, 1863, approved the rule <em>ad decennium</em>. On 8 May, 1895, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> approved it <em>in perpetuum</em>. The first to join the founder was Pere de Cuers, whose example was soon followed by Pere Champion. The community prospered, and in 1862 Pere Eymard opened a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, which was to consist of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>. The former recite the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> in choir and perform all the other <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; the latter share in the principal end of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> &mdash; perpetual adoration, and attend to the various household employments peculiar to their state. The <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is always exposed for adoration, and the sanctuary never without adorers in <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a>, and if a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a>. Every hour at the sound of the signal bell, all the religious kneel and recite a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> and of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>. Since 1856, the following houses have been established: <ul> <li>France &mdash; <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1856), <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> (1859), <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a>, (1861), <a href="../cathen/10068c.htm">Saint Maurice</a> (1866), Trevoux (1895), Sarcelles (1898); Belgium-Brussels (1866), Ormeignies (1898), Oostduinkerke (1902), Bassenge (1902), Baronville (1910), Baelen Post Eupen on the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> frontier for Germans (1909); <li>Italy &mdash; <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1882), <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> (1901), Castel-Vecchio (1905); <li>Austria &mdash; Botzen (1896); <li>Holland &mdash; Baarle-Nassau, now Nijmegen (1902); <li>Spain &mdash; Tolosa (1907); <li>Argentina &mdash; Buenos-Ayres (1903); <li>Chile &mdash; Santiago (1908); <li>Canada &mdash; <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (1890), Terrebonne (1902); <li>United States &mdash; New York (1900); Suffern, N. Y. (1907). </ul>

<p>All the houses in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> were closed by the Government in 1900 but Perpetual Adoration is still held in their <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, which is in charge of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, by the members of "The People's Eucharistic League". The first foundation in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> took place in 1900, under the leadership of P&egrave;re Estevenon, the present superior-general, in New York City, where the Fathers were received in the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Saint-Jean-Baptiste, 185 East 76th Street. A new church is under construction. In September, 1904, the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> opened a preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Suffern, Rockland Co., N. Y. Here young boys who give evidence of a vocation are trained to the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, while pursuing a course of secular study. From the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> the youths pass to the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, where, after two years, they make the three <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of religion, and then enter upon their first <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course preparatory to <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>.

<p>From every house of the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> emanates a series of Eucharistic works, all instituted by their founder. They are: "The Eucharistic Weeks, or, Lights and Flowers", a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> whose members devote themselves to the proper adornment of the altar; "The People's Eucharistic League", which numbers over 500,000; "The Priests' Eucharistic League", with a membership of 100,000; "The Priests' Communion League" an association of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> under the title of "Sacerdotal Eucharistic League", established at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the church of San Claudio, July, 1906, and at once raised by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> to the dignity of an archconfraternity. Its object is to spread the practice of frequent and daily Communion, in conformity with the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Sacred Congregation of the Council, "De quotidiana SS. Eucharisti&aelig; sumptione" (20 December, 1905). The means there highly recommended refer to the following points: (1) To instruct, refute objections, spread writings favouring daily Communion; (2) To encourage assistance at Holy Mass; (3) To promote Eucharistic triduums; (4) To induce children especially to approach the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">Holy Table</a> frequently. "The Society of Nocturnal Adoration", the members of which for an entire night keep watch before the Host, reciting the Office of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, and offering various acts of reparative homage; The apostolate of the press is a prominent feature in the labours of these religious. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, they publish "Emmanuel", the organ of <a href="../cathen/12422b.htm">"The Priests' Eucharistic League"</a>, and "The Sentinel of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>".
