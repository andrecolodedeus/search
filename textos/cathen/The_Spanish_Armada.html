<h1>The Spanish Armada</h1>  

<p>The Spanish Armada, also called the Invincible Armada (<em>infra</em>), and more correctly <em>La Armada Grande</em>, was a fleet (I) intended to invade <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and to put an end to the long series of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> aggressions against the colonies and possessions of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish Crown</a>; (II) it was however all but destroyed by a week's fighting and a disastrous cruise; (III) this led to the gradual decadence of the maritime power of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; (IV) <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> on the whole supported the Armada, but with some notable exceptions.
<h2 id="section1">English provocation</h2>

<p>At the commencement of Elizabeth's reign (1558) <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip</a> had been her best friend. His intercession helped to save her life after <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wycliffe's</a> rebellion (1554). He facilitated her accession, supported her against the claims of <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Stuart</a>, and intervened powerfully in her favor to prevent <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> aid from being sent to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. When <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> had emerged triumphant at the treaty of <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a> (1560), Elizabeth sent him a special mission of thanks, with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Lord Montague at its head, to whom she gave a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in order that he might practice <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> during the embassy.

<p>The victory of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> now being complete, greater coolness was shown. As time went on the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> ambassador was treated with disrespect, his house beset, visitors to his <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>; <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> ships were <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a> with impunity in the Channel. In 1562, Hawkins forced his way by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> into the forbidden markets of the West Indies, his trade being chiefly in <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slaves</a>, whom he had captured in West <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. In 1564 and 1567 the same <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> measures were repeated, but the last ended in disaster for him. Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> party in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> began to rebel in 1566, and was subsidized by <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.

<p>In 1568, a <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> ship having put into <a href="../cathen/12171b.htm">Plymouth</a> with pay for the whole of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> army in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, the money was seized by the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> government. Here ensued reprisals on both sides, trade was paralyzed, and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was on the point of breaking out, both on the occasion of the Northern rising (1569) and at the time of the Ridolfi conspiracy in 1571. The imprudent <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> ambassador, Don Gerau Despes, was then expelled from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip</a> having previously dismissed from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> ambassador, Dr. Mann, an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, whose selection was naturally considered an insult. Whilst the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> fleet was fighting the cause of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> at Lepanto (1572), Drake thrice sacked the almost defenseless colonies on the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> Main, from which he returned with enormous booty (1570, 1571, 1572-73).

<p>Slightly better relations between the two countries ensued toward the close of this decade, when Elizabeth feared that, with the decay of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> power in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> might conquer the country for herself. So in 1578 a <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> ambassador was received in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, though at the same time Drake was allowed to sail on his great buccaneering voyage around the world. On his return public opinion began to condemn aloud the "master-robber of the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>", but Elizabeth exerted herself warmly in his favor, gave him the honor of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knighthood</a>, and three years later, immediately before sending her army to fight the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, she dispatched him once more to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">spoil</a> the West Indies. It was then that Drake "convinced <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> that in <a href="../cathen/13691a.htm">self-defense</a> she must crush <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>" (J.R. Seeley, <em>Growth of British Policy</em>).

<p>Mr. Froude and the older panegyrists of Queen Elizabeth frequently justify the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> piracies as acts of retaliation against the cruelties of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, and maintain that <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip</a> had given cause for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> by encouraging plots against Elizabeth's throne and <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>. The prime motive of the Armada, they say, was to overthrow <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. But these statements cannot be substantiated and are misleading (see Laughton, p. xxii; Pollen, The Month, February, March, April, 1902). It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the ineffective attempts of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> to shut out the rest of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> from traffic with her colonies were unwise, perhaps <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, and acted as an incentive to secret and unwarranted traffic. But it must also be remembered that <a href="../cathen/10497b.htm">trade monopolies</a> flourished in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to such an extent that her pirates may have taken to that profession because honorable trading was so much impeded (Dascent, Acts of Privy Council, VII, p. xviii). On the other hand, one must unreservedly blame the cruelties of <a href="../cathen/01371a.htm">Alva</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisitors</a>, which much embittered the struggle when it had once begun.
<h2 id="section2">The conflict</h2>

<p>Since July, 1580, <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip</a> had begun to regard the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> freebooters in a new light. He had then made good by the force of arms his claim to the crown of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, by which he became lord over the rich and widely-stretching <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> colonies. If he did not soon bestir himself to defend them, they would be lost as well as <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a>. He was, moreover, now the master of a considerable fleet. The danger from the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turk</a> had been greatly diminished. The <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> had sapped the powers of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. James of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> had broken the trammels with which Elizabeth had bound him during his boyhood, and he showed some desire to help his mother, <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Queen Mary</a>, and she might persuade the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to support the army that should be sent to liberate her. But <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip</a> arrived at his conclusion so very slowly and silently that it is hard to say when he passed from speculative <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> to the actual determination to fight.

<p>In April, May, and June, 1587, Drake cruised off the coast of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and, contrary to Elizabeth's wish, attacked the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> shipping, burnt the half-finished and unmanned ships at <a href="../cathen/03131b.htm">Cadiz</a>, and did enormous damage to the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> navy. <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip</a>, at last convinced that fight he must, began to exert himself to the utmost. But his inefficiency as an organizer was never more evident. Slow, inactive, and not only <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the secret of sea power, but unwilling to admit that there was any need for special advice and direction, he wasted months on making plans of campaign while the building and vitualling of the fleet was neglected.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> of that day were reputed the best soldiers in the world, but in naval maneuvers and in the use of heavy artillery they were far behind their rivals. The worst blunder of all was committed after the death of the Marquess of Santa Cruz, Don Alvaro de Bazan the elder, a veteran sailor, the only naval commander of repute that <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> possessed. <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip</a> after long consideration appointed the Duke of Medina Sidonia to succeed him. In vain did the Duke express his lack of ability and his inexperience in naval matters. The king insisted, and the great nobleman loyally left his splendid castle to attempt the impossible, and to make in <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a> the most disastrous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of leadership.

<p>A striking comment on the inefficiency of the vast preparations is afforded by the letters of the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip's</a> court. He reports at the end of February, 1588, that he had been talking with the other envoys from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and that none of them could make out for certain that the fleet was intended to attack <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> after all, for which they all thought it far too weak. Next month he was reassured by one of <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip's</a> own councillors &#151; they felt sure all would go well, if they once got a footing in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (Vatican Archives, Germania, CX sq., 58, 60).

<p>The Armada left <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> on the 20th of May, 1588. It consisted of about 130 ships, and 30,493 <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; but at least half of the ships were transports, and two-thirds of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were soldiers. It was bound for <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, where it was to join the Prince of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, who had built a number of pontoons and transports to carry over his army. But the fleet found it necessary to put back in the harbor of Corunna almost immediately, in order to refit. The admiral was already suggesting that the expedition should be given up, but <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip</a> continued to insist, and it sailed on the 12th of July, according to the old style then observed in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. This time the voyage prospered, and a week later the Armada had reassembled at the Lizard and proceeded next day, Saturday, 20 July, eastward towards <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>.

<p>Beacon lights gave notice of their arrival to the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a>, who hurriedly put out from <a href="../cathen/12171b.htm">Plymouth</a> and managed to slip past the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> in the night, thus gaining the weather gauge, an advantage they never afterwards lost. The fighting ships of the Armada were now arranged in a crescent, the transports keeping between the horns, and in this formation, they slowly advanced up the channel, the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> cannonading the rearmost, and causing the loss of three of the chief vessels. Still on Saturday afternoon, 27 July, the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> were anchored in Calais roads, in sore need of refitting indeed, but with numbers still almost intact.

<p>According to the best modern authorities, these numbers, which had been at first slightly in favor of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, now that the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> had received reinforcements and the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> had met with losses, were in favor of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a>. There were about sixty warships in either fleet, but in number and weight of guns, the advantage was with the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a>, and in gunnery and naval tactics there was no comparison at all.

<p>Howard did not allow his enemy any time to refit. The next night some fireships were drifted into the Armada as the tide flowed. The <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, ready for this danger, slipped their cables, but nonetheless suffered some losses from collisions. On the Monday following, the great battle took place off Gravelines, in which the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> were entirely outclassed and defeated. It says much for their heroism that only one ship was reported captured; but three sank, four or five ran ashore, and the Duke of Medina Sidonia took the resolution of leading the much damaged remnant around the north of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and so back to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. But for that very difficult voyage they had neither a chart nor a pilot in the whole fleet. More and more ships were now lost in every storm, and at every point of danger. Eventually on the 13th of September, the duke returned to <a href="../cathen/13458d.htm">Santander</a>, having lost about half his fleet and about three-quarters of his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.
<h2 id="section3">The sequel</h2>

<p>Great as were the effects of the failure of the Armada, they are nevertheless often exaggerated. The defeat no doubt set bounds on the expansion of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and secured the power of her rival. Yet it is a mistake to suppose that this change was immediate, obvious, or uniform. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, promoted by Elizabeth, ended in weakening that country to such an extent that <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> seemed within two years of the Armada to be nearer to universal domination than ever before, and this consummation was averted by the reconciliation of <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry IV</a> to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, which, by reuniting <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, restored the balance of power in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, as was acknowledged by <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> at the peace of Vervius in 1598.

<p>Even the change of sea power was not immediate or obvious. In reality <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> had always been the superior at sea, as the history of Drake and his colleagues clearly shows. Her weakness lay in the smallness of her standing navy, and her want of adequate ammunition. <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> took so long to attempt a readjustment of sea-power, that <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> had ample time to organize and arm a superior fleet. But <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, though she failed at sea, remained the chief power on land, and, having recognized her naval inferiority, strengthened her land defenses with such success that the depredation of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in her colonies after her defeat were incomparably less than those which had occurred before. Her decline ensued because <em>the causes of the defeat</em> were not remedied. <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">Slave labor</a>, with its attendant corruptions, in the colonies, want of organization, and free government at home, joined with grasping at power abroad--these, and not any single defeat, however great, were the causes of the decline of the great world-power of the sixteenth century.
<h2 id="section4">Catholic co-operation</h2>

<p>Among the many side-issues which meet the student of the history of the Armada, that of the cooperation or favor of the <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Pope</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party among the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a>, is naturally important for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. There can be no doubt, then, that though the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> predominance was not at all desired for its own sake by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, or of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, yet the widespread suffering and irritation caused by the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> Elizabeth fomented, and the indignation caused by her <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">religious persecution</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">execution</a> of <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Stuart</a>, caused <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> everywhere to sympathize with <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and to regard the Armada as a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the most dangerous enemy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Faith</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Pope Sixtus V</a> agreed to renew the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of the queen, and to grant a large subsidy to the Armada, but, knowing the slowness of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, would give nothing till the expedition should actually land in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In this way he was saved his million crowns, and spared the reproach of having taken futile proceedings against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> queen. This <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> had of course been richly deserved, and there is extant a proclamation to justify it, which was to have been published in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> if the invasion had been successful. It was signed by <a href="../cathen/01322b.htm">Cardinal Allen</a>, and is entitled "An Admonition to the Nobility and Laity of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>". It was intended to comprise all that could be said against the queen, and the indictment is therefore fuller and more forcible than any other put forward by the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> exiles, who were generally very reticent in their complaints. <a href="../cathen/01322b.htm">Allen</a> also carefully consigned his publication to the fire, and we only know of it through one of Elizabeth's ubiquitous spies, who had previously stolen a copy.

<p>There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that all the exiles for <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a> at that time shared <a href="../cathen/01322b.htm">Allen's</a> sentiments, but not so the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. They had always been the most conservative of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> parties. The resentment they felt at being <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> led them to blame the queen's ministers, but not to question her <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to rule. To them the great power of Elizabeth was evident, the forces and intentions of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> were unknown quantities. They might, should, and did resist until complete justification was set before them, and this was in fact never attempted. Much, for instance, as we know of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">Catholic clergy</a> then laboring in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, we cannot find that any of them used <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a> to advance the cause of the Armada. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> contemporaries alike agree that the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were energetic in their preparations against it.

<p>This being so, it was inevitable that the leaders of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> abroad should lose influence, through having sided with <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. On the other hand, as the <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">pope</a> and all among whom they lived had been of the same mind, it was evidently unjust to blame their want of political insight too harshly. It point of fact the change did not come until near the end of Elizabeth's reign, when, during the appeals against the <a href="../cathen/16004a.htm">archpriest</a>, the old leaders, especially the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/11729a.htm">Father Robert Persons</a>, were freely blamed for the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> alliance. The terms of the blame were exaggerated, but the reason for complaint cannot be denied.

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The literature that has been gathered round the Armada is voluminous, and of course has been largely influenced by the national and religious prejudices of the contending nations. A trifle may suffice to indicate how the wind has been blowing. Almost all writers hitherto have written of the "Invincible" Armada, thinking that they were using an epithet applied to their fleet by the Spaniards themselves, and one that confessedly betrayed Spanish pride. Now it appears that it was only one of the insults that contemporary English pamphleteers, and is not found in any contemporary Spanish writer (Laughton, p. xix). On the English side, the most representative of the old school are J. L. Motley, Rise of the Dutch Republic, and J. A. Froude, History of England, XII, and English Seamen of the Sixteenth century. The last writer is notoriously inaccurate, but the worst fault of both is their reliance on colored, and even grossly prejudiced evidence. The older Spanish view is given by F. Strada, De Bello Belico, and L. Carrera de Cordoba, Felipe Segudo, 1619. But all these writers have been superseded by the publication of English and Spanish state papers, especially by J. K. Laughton and J. S. Corbett, in the publications of the Navy Record Society (London, 1892-93), I, II, and the Spanish collections of Captain C. Fernandez Duro, La Armada Invencible (Madrid, 1884), and Armada Espanola, II, III (Madrid, 1896); and Martin Hume, Spanish Calendars. Still the chief desideratum at present is a more ample collection of Spanish papers illustrating the whole naval war from the beginning. D. de Alcedo y Herrera, Piraterias y aggressiones de los Ingleses en la America espanola (Madrid, 1882) conatins little about the period under review. The most scholarly account of the fighting yet published is that of a American student, W. F. Tilton, Die Katastrophe der spanischen Armada (Freiburg, 1894). J. S. Corbett, Drake and the Tudor Navy, endeavors to reconcile the old English traditions with modern discoveries, and not always scientifically. For Papal and Catholic views see J. A. v. Hubner, Sixte Quint (Paris, 1870, best edition); T.F. Knox, Letters of Cardinal Allen (London 1882).</p></div>
