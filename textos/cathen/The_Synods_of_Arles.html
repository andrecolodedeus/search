<h1>The Synods of Arles</h1>  

<p>The first Council of Arles was held in 314, for the purpose of putting an end to the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> controversy. It confirmed the findings of the Council of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (313), i.e. it recognized the validity of the election of Caecilian of Carthage, and confirmed the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of Donatus of Casae Nigrae. Its twenty-two canons dealing with various abuses that had crept into <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life since the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> (284-305) are among the most important documents of early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation. A council held in 353, and attended, among others, by two <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a>, was decidedly <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> in attitude. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> were tempted into rejecting communion with <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> and refused to condemn Arius, an act which filled <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Pope Liberius</a> with grief. In the synod of 443 (452), attended also by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of neighbouring provinces, fifty-six canons were formulated, mostly repetitions of earlier disciplinary decrees. Neophytes were excluded from major orders; married men aspiring to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> were required to promise a life of continency, and it was forbidden to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> without the assistance of three other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the consent of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. A council of 451 held after the close of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> in that year, sent its adhesion to the "Epistola dogmatica" of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a>, written by <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian of Constantinople</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">EUTYCHES</a>.) A council was held on New Year's Day, 435, to settle the differences that had arisen between the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of L&eacute;rins and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06269a.htm">Fr&eacute;jus</a>. Apropos of the conflict between the archiepiscopal See of Vienne and Arles a council was held in the latter city in 463, which called forth a famous letter from <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo I</a> (Leonis I, Opp., ed. <a href="../cathen/02223b.htm">Ballerini</a>, I, 998; Hefele, Conciliengeschichte, II, 590). Between 475 and 480 another council was called, attended by thirty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, in which the pre-destinationist teachings of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Lucidus were condemned. In 524 a council was held under the presidency of <a href="../cathen/03135b.htm">St. Caesarius of Arles</a>; its canons deal chiefly with the conferring of orders. Little is known of the councils of 554 and 682. An important council was held in 813, at the instigation of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, for the correction of abuses and the reestablishment of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>. Its decrees insist on a sufficient <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, on the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of both to preach frequently to the people and to instruct them in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, on the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to instruct their children, etc. In 1034 a council was held at Arles for the re-establishment of peace, the restoration of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>, the awakening in the popular heart of a sense of divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and of salutary fear by the consideration of past evils. In 1236 a council held under the presidency of Jean Baussan, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Arles, issued twenty-four canons, mostly against the prevalent <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensian heresy</a>, and for the observance of the decrees of the Lateran Council of 1215 and that of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> in 1229. Close inspection of their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> is urged on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, as a remedy against the spread of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; testaments are declared invalid unless made in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. This measure, met with in other councils, was meant to prevent testamentary dispositions in favour of known <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. In 1251, Jean, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Arles, held a <a href="../cathen/02159a.htm">council near Avignon</a> (<em>Concilium Insculanum</em>), among whose thirteen canons is one providing that the sponsor at <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is bound to give only the white robe in which the infant is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. In 1260 a council held by Florentin, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Arles, decreed that confirmation must be received <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and that on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feast days the religious should not open their churches to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, nor preach at the hour of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> Mass. The <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> should be instructed by their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The religious should also frequent the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> service, for the sake of good example. This council also condemned the doctrines spread abroad under the name of <a href="../cathen/08406c.htm">Joachim of Flora</a>. In 1275, earlier observances, twenty-two in number, were <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> anew at a Council of Arles.
