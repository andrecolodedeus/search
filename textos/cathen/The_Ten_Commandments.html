<h1>The Ten Commandments</h1>  

<p>Called also simply THE COMMANDMENTS, COMMANDMENTS OF GOD, or <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">THE DECALOGUE</a> (Gr. <em>deka</em>, ten, and <em>logos</em>, a word), the Ten Words of Sayings, the latter name generally applied by the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>.

<p>The Ten Commandments are precepts bearing on the fundamental <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a> and embodying the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> expression of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator's</a> will in relation to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> whole <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to his fellow-creatures. They are found twice recorded in the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>, in <a href="../bible/exo020.htm#vrs20">Exodus 20</a> and <a href="../bible/deu005.htm#vrs5">Deuteronomy 5</a>, but are given in an abridged form in the <a href="../cathen/13120c.htm">catechisms</a>. Written by the finger of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on two tables of stone, this <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine code</a> was received from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty</a> by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> amid the thunders of <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a>, and by him made the ground-work of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> resumed these Commandments in the double precept of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>--<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of the neighbour; He proclaimed them as binding under the New Law in <a href="../bible/mat019.htm#vrs19">Matthew 19</a> and in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs5">Matthew 5</a>). He also simplified or interpreted them, e.g. by declaring unnecessary <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a> equally unlawful with false, by condemning <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, by enjoining even <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of enemies, and by condemning indulgence of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires as fraught with the same malice as <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs5">Matthew 5</a>). The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, on the other hand, after changing the day of rest from the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Jewish Sabbath</a>, or seventh day of the week, to the first, made the Third Commandment refer to <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> as the day to be kept <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> as the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Lord's Day</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. VI, can. xix) condemns those who deny that the Ten Commandments are binding on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.

<p>There is no numerical division of the Commandments in the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Books of Moses</a>, but the injunctions are distinctly tenfold, and are found almost identical in both sources. The order, too, is the same except for the final prohibitions pronounced against <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, that of <a href="../bible/deu000.htm">Deuteronomy</a> being adopted in preference to <a href="../bible/exo000.htm">Exodus</a>. A confusion, however, exists in the numbering, which is due to a difference of opinion concerning the initial precept on <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">Divine worship</a>.

<p>The system of numeration found in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">Bibles</a>, based on the <a href="../cathen/07175a.htm">Hebrew text</a>, was made by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (fifth century) in his book of "Questions of Exodus" ("Qu&aelig;stionum in Heptateuchum libri VII", Bk. II, Question lxxi), and was adopted by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. It is followed also by the German <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, except those of the school of <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Bucer</a>. This arrangement makes the First Commandment relate to false worship and to the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">worship of false gods</a> as to a single subject and a single class of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to be guarded against &#151; the reference to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> being regarded as mere application of the precept to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the prohibition as directed against the particular offense of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> alone. According to this manner of reckoning, the injunction forbidding the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">use of the Lord's Name in vain</a> comes second in order; and the decimal number is safeguarded by making a division of the final precept on <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>--the Ninth pointing to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh and the Tenth to desires for unlawful possession of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">goods</a>.

<p>Another division has been adopted by the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> and <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Helvetian</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> churches on the authority of <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo Jud&aelig;us</a>, <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, and others, whereby two Commandments are made to cover the matter of <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">worship</a>, and thus the numbering of the rest is advanced one higher; and the Tenth embraces both the Ninth and Tenth of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> division. It seems, however, as logical to separate at the end as to group at the beginning, for while one single object is aimed at under <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">worship</a>, two specifically different <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forbidden under <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>; if <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and theft belong to two distinct species of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">moral wrong</a>, the same must be said of the desire to commit these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evils</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Supreme Law-Giver</a> begins by proclaiming <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">His Name</a> and His Titles to the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of the creature <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: "I am the <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Lord</a>, thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. . ." The <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">laws</a> which follow have regard to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His representatives on earth (first four) and to our fellow-man (last six). <ul><li>Being the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">one true God</a>, He alone is to be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>, and all rendering to creatures of the <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">worship</a> which belongs to Him falls under the ban of His displeasure; the making of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">"graven things"</a> is condemned: not all pictures, <a href="../cathen/07664a.htm">images</a>, and works of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a>, but such as are intended to be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> and served (First). <li>Associated with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and representing Him, is <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">His Holy Name</a>, which by the Second Commandment is declared worthy of all veneration and respect and its <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">profanation</a> reprobated. <li>And He claims <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">one day</a> out of the seven as a memorial to Himself, and this must be kept <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> (Third). <li>Finally, <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> being the natural providence of their offspring, invested with authority for their guidance and correction, and holding the place of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> before them, the child is bidden to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and respect them as His lawful representatives (Fourth).</ul>

<p>The precepts which follow are meant to protect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his natural <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> against the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> of his fellows.

<ul><li>His <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> is the object of the Fifth; <li>the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of his body as well as the source of <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>, of the Sixth; <li>his lawful <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">possessions</a>, of the Seventh; <li>his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>, of the Eighth; <li>And in order to make him still more secure in the enjoyment of his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, it is declared an offense against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to desire to wrong him, in his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> by the Ninth; <li>and in his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> by the Tenth. </ul>

<p>This legislation expresses not only the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Maker's</a> positive will, but the voice of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">nature</a> as well--the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">laws</a> which govern our being and are written more or less clearly in every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> heart. The necessity of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">written law</a> is explained by the obscuring of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">unwritten</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. These <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine mandates</a> are regarded as binding on every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human creature</a>, and their violation, with sufficient reflection and <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> of the will, if the matter be grave, is considered a grievous or mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">offense against God</a>. They have always been esteemed as the most precious rules of life and are the basis of all Christian legislation.
