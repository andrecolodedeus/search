<h1>The Theological Aspects of the Avesta</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">God</h2>

<p>The name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Supreme God</a> of the Avestic system is <em><a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a></em> (in the Achaemenid royal inscriptions, <em>Auramazda</em>), which probably signifies the All-Wise Lord. This divine name was later modified into the Pahlavi form <em>Auharmazd</em>, the modern Persian <em><a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ormuzd</a></em> (Greek <em>Oromazes</em>). Hence the name of <em>Mazdeism</em> commonly applied to Avestic religion.

<p>Ahura Mazda is a pure spirit; His chief attributes are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, wisdom, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, majesty, power. He is the Creator (<em>datar</em>) of the all good creatures &mdash; not, however, of Evil, or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> beings. He is the supreme Lawgiver, the Rewarder of moral good, and the Punisher of moral <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. He dwells in Eternal Light; in the later literature light is spoken of as the clothing of <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a> or even His "body", i.e. a kind of manifestation of His presence, like the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> <em>Shekinah</em>. In this same patristic (Pahlavi) literature we find frequent enumerations of the attributes of <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a>; thus these are said to be "omniscience, <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a>, all-sovereignty, all-goodness". Again He is styled "Supreme Sovereign, Wise Creator, Supporter, Protector, Giver of good things, Virtuous in act, Merciful, Pure Lawgiver, Lord of the good Creations".
<h2 id="section2">Dualism</h2>

<p>It has been remarked above that <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a> is the Creator of all good creatures. This at once indicates the specific and characteristic feature of the Avestic <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> generally known as "dualism". The great problem of the origin of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which has ever been the main stumbling-block of religious systems, was solved in the <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Zoroastrian</a> Reform by the trenchant, if illogical, device of two separate creators and creations: one good, the other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Opposed to <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a>, or Ormuzd, is His rival, <em><a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Anro Mainyus</a></em> (later, <em>Aharman, Ahriman</em>), the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil Spirit</a>. He is conceived as existing quite independently of <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a>, apparently from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, but destined to destruction at the end of time. Evil by nature and in every detail the exact opposite of <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a>, he is the creator of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, both moral and physical. Zoroaster in the Gathas says (Ys., xlv, 2, Jackon's translation):

<blockquote><p>Now shall I preach of the World's <em>two primal Spirits</em>, <br>The Holier one of which did thus address the Evil: <br>Neither do our minds, our teachings, nor our concepts, <br>Nor our <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>, nor words, nor do our deeds in sooth, <br>Nor yet our consciences, nor <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> agree in aught. </p></blockquote>

<p>It is here to be remarked that the specific name of <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a> in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil Spirit</a> is <em>Spento Mainyus</em>, the Holy Spirit, and <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a> and Spento Mainyus are used as synonyms throughout the <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Avesta</a>. The obviously illogical <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of two separate and supreme creators eventually led to certain <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> attempts to reduce the double system to uniformity. One of these consisted in throwing back the Divine unity to an anterior stage in which <em>Zrvana Akarana</em>, "illimitable time", becomes the single, indifferent, primordial source from which both spirits proceed. Another solution was sought in attributing two spirits (faculties or functions) to <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a> himself, his Spento Mainyus and his <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Anro Mainyus</a>, or his creative and destructive spirit &#151; an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> probably borrowed from Indian philosophy. This seems the favourite <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the modern Parsees of <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>, as may be seen in Mr. Navroji Maneckji Kanga's article in the "Babylonian and Oriental Record" for May, 1900 (VIII, 224-28), and it is claimed to be strictly founded on teaching of the Gathas; but although such a development of thought a real <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">monotheism</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Zoroastrian</a> <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a>, these theories cannot really be called Avestic at all, except in so far as <em>Zrvana Akarana</em> is an Avestic term. They are "patristic" or "scholastic".

<p>The result of the <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualistic</a> conception of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is that of a continuous <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> that has been going on even from the beginning between two hostile worlds or camps. All creatures belong to one or another of the camps, not only sentient and intelligent beings, like the spirit and man, but also the animal and the vegetable worlds. All dangerous, noxious, poisonous animals and plants are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by their very creation and nature. [We see here the primal germ of <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ism</a>. Mani was a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> of the Mazdean <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (A.D. 258). This "heresy" is often reprobated in the Pahlavi religious books, together with <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.] Hence &mdash; in sharp contrast to the Hindi <em>ahimsa</em>, a characteristic tenet of <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a>, which prohibits the killing of any creature, even the smallest and the most noxious insect &mdash; to kill as many as possible of the Khrafstras, or noxious creatures of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil Spirit</a> (such as wolves, serpents, snakes, locusts, intestinal worms, ants), is one of the most meritorious of religious actions. This great <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a>, both spiritual and material, will go on to the end of time. It is to end in a final triumph of the Good and the annihilation (apparently) of Evil, including <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Anro Mainyus</a> himself. Such at least is the teaching in the later "patristic" literature.


<h2 id="section3">Angelology</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a> in its widest sense seems to be an inherent and ineradicable tendency of the Iranian mind. Almost everything is conceived in pairs or doubles. Hence the constant reference to the "Two Worlds", the spiritual and the material. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Spirit World, whether belonging to the good or the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> creation, is highly developed in the <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Avesta</a> and subsequent literature. Around <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a> is a whole <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of spirits, corresponding very closely with our <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">"angels"</a>. There is, however, this to be noted, that in the <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Zoroastrian</a> system many of these creature-spirits are demonstrably old Aryan nature <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> who have been skilfully transformed into <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and so fitted into a <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">monotheistic</a> framework, frequently enough, in <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and other passages, by the simple interpolation of the epithet <em>Mazdadata</em> (created by Mazda), before their names. Of the good spirits who surround <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura</a>, the most important are the <em>Amesha Spentas</em> ("Holy Immortals" or "Immortal Saints") generally reckoned as six (though <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a> himself is frequently included among them, and they are then called seven). These are the characteristic genii of the Gathas and their very names show that they are merely personified attributes of the Creator Himself. They are: <em>Vohu Manah</em> (Good Mind), <em>Asha Vahishta</em> (Best Holiness), <em>Khshathra Vairya</em> (Desirable Sovereignty), <em>Spenta Armaiti</em> (Holy Piety, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> spirit), <em>Haurvatat</em> (Health), and <em>Ameretat</em> (Immortality). In the Younger <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Avesta</a> and later traditional literature these evident personifications, whose very names are but abstract nouns, become more and more concrete personages or genii, with varying functions, most of all <em>Vohu Manah</em> (Vohuman) rises to a position of unique importance. Dr. L.H. Gray, however, argues, in a very striking article, that even these are evolutions of original naturalistic <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> [Archiv f&uuml;r <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> wissenschaft (Leipzig, 1904), VII, 345-372]. In later patristic literature Vohu Manah is conceived as the "Son of the Creator" and identified with the Alexandrine <em>Logos</em>. (See Casartelli, Philosophy of the Mazdayasnian Religion, 42-90.) Asha, also (the equivalent of the Sanskrit <em>Rta=Dharma</em>), is the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine Law</a>, Right, Sanctity (cf. <a href="../bible/psa118.htm">Psalm 118</a>), and occupies a most conspicuous position throughout the <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Avesta</a>.

<p>But besides the Amesha Spentas, there are a few other archangels whose rank is scarcely less, if it does not sometimes exceed theirs. Such is <em>Sraosha</em> ("Obedience" &mdash; i.e. to the divine Law). With him are associated, in a trio, <em>Rashnu</em> (Right, Justice) and <em><a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithra</a></em>. This last is perhaps the most characteristic, as he is the most enigmatical, figure of the Iranian <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelology</a>. Undoubtedly in origin (like the <a href="../cathen/15318a.htm">Vedic</a> <em>Mitra</em>) a Sun-deity of the primitive Aryan nature-worship, he has been taken over into the <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Avesta</a> system as the Spirit of Light and Truth &mdash; the favourite and typical virtue of the Iranian race, as testified even by the Greek historians. So important is his position that he is constantly linked with <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a> himself, apparently almost as an equal, in a manner recalling some of the divine couples of the Vedas. It is well known how in later times the <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithra cult</a> became a regular religion and spread from <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> all over the Roman Empire, even into Britain. [See, especially, Cumont's great work, Monuments relatifs au cultede Mithra" (Paris, 1893).] Nor must mention be omitted of Atars, the Genius of Fire, on account of the particular importance and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> attached to fire as a symbol of the divinity and its conspicuous use in the cult (which has given rise to the entirely <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> conception of <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Zoroastrianism</a> as "Fire-worship", and of the Parsees as "Fire-worshippers"). Water, Sun, Moon, Stars, the sacred <em>Haoma</em> plant (Skt. <em>Soma</em>), and other natural elements all have their special spirits. But particular mention must be made of the enigmatical Farvashis, the origin and nature of whom is still uncertain. Some writers [especially Soderblom, "Les Fravashis" (Paris, 1899); "La vie future" (Paris, 1901)] have seen in them the spirits of the departed, like the <em>dii manes</em>, or the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> <em>pitris</em>. But, as a matter of fact, their primal conception seems to approach nearest to the pre-existent <em>Ideai</em> of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. Every living creature has its own Fravashi, existing before its creation; nay in some places inanimate beings, and, stranger still, <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a> Himself, have their Fravashis. They play an important role in both the <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a> and the ritual cult of Mazdeism.

<p>Face to face with the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of celestial spirits is a diabolical one, that of the <em>daevas</em> (demons, Pahlavi and Mod. Persian <em>div</em> or <em>dev</em>) and <em>druj's</em> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil Spirit</a>. They fill exactly the places of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and Jewish <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. Chief of them is Aka Manah (Pahlavi Akoman, "Evil Mind"), the direct opponent of Vohu Manah. Perhaps the most frequently mentioned of all is <em>Aeshma</em>, the Demon of Wrath or Violence, whose name has come down to us in the <a href="../cathen/01792c.htm">Asmodeus</a> (<em>Aeshmo daeva</em>) of the Book of Tobias (iii, 8). The <em>Pairikas</em> are <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> spirits of seductive but malignant nature, who are familiar to us finder the form of the Peris of later Persian poetry and Iegend.
<h2 id="section4">Man</h2>

<p>In the midst of the secular <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> that has gone on from the beginning between the two hosts of Good and Evil stands Man. Man is the creature of the Good Spirit, but endowed with a <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> and power of choice, able to place himself on the side of <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a> or on that of <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Anro Mainyus</a>. The former has given him, through His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Zarathushtra (Zoroaster) His <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a> and law is (<em>daena</em>). According as man obeys or disobeys this <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> his future lot will be decided; by it he will be judged at his death. The whole <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> system is built upon this great principle, as in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. Moral good, righteousness, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> (<em>asha</em>) is according to the Divine will and decrees; Man by his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> conforms to, or transgresses, these. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil Spirit</a> and his <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">innumerable hosts</a> tempt Man to deny or transgress the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, as he tempted Zoroaster himself, promising him as reward the sovereignty of the whole world. &mdash; "No!" replied the Prophet, "I will not renounce it, even if body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and life should be severed!" (Vendidad, xix, 25, 26). It is well to emphasize this basis of Avestic <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, because it at once marks off the <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Avesta</a> system from the fatalistic systems of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> with their <em>karma</em> and innate pessimism. [See Casartelli, "Id&eacute;e du p&eacute;ch&eacute; chez les Indo-Eraniens" (Fribourg, 1898.)]. A characteristic note of Iranian religious philosophy is its essential optimism; if there is human <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, there is also repentance and expiation. In the later Pahlavi religious literature there is a proper confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (<em>patet</em>) and a developed casuistry. Asceticism, however, finds no place therein.

<p>Divine worship, with elaborate ritual, is an essential <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of man towards his Creator. There is indeed no animal sacrifice; the leading rites are the offering of the quasi-divine <em>haoma</em> (the fermented juice of the a sacred plant, a species of <em>Asclepias</em>), the exact counterpart of the <a href="../cathen/15318a.htm">Vedic</a> <em>soma</em>-sacrifice; the care of the Sacred Fire, the chanting of the ritual <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and passages of the Sacred Books (Avesta).

<p>The moral teaching is closely akin to our own. Stress is constantly laid on the necessity of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in thought, word, and deed (<em>humata, hakhta, hvarshta</em>) as opposed to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thought, word, and deed (<em>dushmata, duzhukhta, duzhvarshta</em>). Note the emphatic recognition of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in thought. Virtues and vices are enumerated and estimated much as in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ethics. Special value is attributed to the virtues of religion, truthfulness, purity and generosity to the poor. Heresy, untruthfulness, <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, sexual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, tyranny are specially reprobated. Zoroaster's reform being social as well as religious agriculture and farming are raised to the rank of religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and regarded as spiritually meritorious. The same will account for the exaggerated importance, almost <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, attached to the dog. On the other hand, the one repulsive feature of Avestic morality is the glorification, as a religious meritorious act, of the <em>Khvaetva-datha</em>, which is nothing else than intermarriage between the nearest of kin, even brothers and sisters. In later times this practice was entirely repudiated by the modern Parsees.
<h2 id="section5">Eschatology</h2>

<p>After death the disembodied <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> hovers around the corpse for three days. Then it sets off across the <em>Cinvat</em> bridge to meet its judgment and final doom in the world beyond the grave. The three judges of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithra</a>, Sraosha, and Rashnu. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the just passes safely over the bridge into a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> (<em>Auhu vahishta, Garo nmana</em>), the abode of <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura</a> and His blessed <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. The wicked <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> falls from the fatal bridge and is precipitated into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> (<em>Duzh auhu</em>). Of this abode of misery a lively description occurs in the later Pahlavi "Vision of Arda Viraf", whose visit to the Inferno, with the realistic description of its torments, vividly recalls that of <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>. The state called <em>Hamestakan</em>, or Middle State, does not appear in <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Avesta</a> itself, but is a development of the later patristic <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. It is not, however, conceived, exactly as our <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, but rather as an indifferent state for those whose <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> deeds are found at death to be in perfect equilibrium. They are therefore neither in suffering nor in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. At the end of time, the approach of which is described in the Pahlavi literature in terms strikingly like those of our Apocalypse, will come to the last Prophet, Saosyant (Saviour) under whom all occur the Ressurection of the Dead (<em>Frashokereti</em>), the General Judgment the <em>apokatastasis</em> or renewal of the whole world by the great conflagration of the earth and consequent flood of burning matter. According to the Pahlavi sources, this terrible flood will purify all creatures; even the wicked will be cleansed and added to the "new heavens and the new earth". Meanwhile a mighty combat takes place between Saoshyant and his followers and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon hosts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil Spirit</a>, who are utterly routed and destroyed forever. (See Yasht, xix and xiii)
<h2 id="section6">Mazdeism and the Persian kings</h2>

<p>It is frequently asserted or assumed that the <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Avesta</a> religion as above sketched was the religion of Darius and the other Achaemenid Kings of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> (549-336 B.C.) From the cuneiform inscriptions of these sovereigns (in the Old Persian language, a sister dialect of the Avestic Zend) we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> pretty well what their religion was. They proclaim themselves Mazdeans (<em>Auramazdiya</em>, Darius, Behistun Column, IV, 56); their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Supreme God</a> is Auramazda, greatest of gods (<em>Mathishta baganam</em>). He is Creator of all things &mdash; <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, earth, and man &mdash; all things happen by His will (<em>vashna</em>); He sees and knows all things, man must obey His <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> (<em>framana</em>), and follow the "good way" (<em>pathim rastam</em>); man must invoke and praise Him; He hates <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, especially falsehood which is denounced as the chief of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, also insubordination and despotism. Inferior spirits are associated with Him, "clan gods" and particularly <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithra</a> and Anahita. Yet, with all these close similarities, we must hesitate to consider the two religious systems are identical. For in this Achaemenid inscriptions there is absolutely no trace of the <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a> which is the characteristic and all-prevailing feature of the <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Avesta</a>, and no allusion whatever to the great <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Zoroaster, or the revelation of which he was the mouthpiece. The exact relation between the two systems remains enigmatical.
<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>"The highest religious result to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> unaided by revelation, can attain" is the deliberate verdict of a learned <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> (Father Ernest Hull, S.J., in "Bombay Examiner" 28 March, 1903). This estimate does not appear exaggerated. The <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Avesta</a> system may be best defined as <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">monotheism</a> modified by a physical and moral <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a>, with an <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> system based on a Divinely revealed <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> code and human <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. As it is now followed by the living descendents of its first votaries, the Parsees of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, it is virtually the same as it appears in the <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Avesta</a> itself, except that its <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">monotheism</a> is more rigid and determined, and that it has shed such objectionable practices as <em>Khvetuk-das</em> (<em>Khvaetva-datha</em>) and seeks to explain them away. A great revival in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the old sacred languages (Zend and Pahlavi) which had become almost forgotten, has taken place during the past half-century under the stimulus of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> scholarship, whose results have been widely adopted and assimilated. The religious cult is scrupulously maintained as of old. The ancient traditional and characteristically national virtues of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and open-handed generosity flourish exceedingly in the small, but highly intelligent, community.
