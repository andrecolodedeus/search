<h1>The University of Aberdeen</h1>  

<p>The founder of this, one of the three <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> established in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> times, was William Elphinstone, who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01041c.htm">Aberdeen</a> from 1483 to 1514. Early in his episcopate a <a href="../cathen/11777a.htm">petition</a> had been sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the name of King James IV, but probably framed by Elphinstone himself, representing the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> which prevailed in the greater part of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and in the northern districts of the kingdom generally. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Papal Bull</a> for the erection of Aberdeen University was issued 24 February, 1491 (1495 according to our modern way of reckoning). Bishop Elphinstone had been a professor at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> for nine years, and it was on the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, both as to form and organization, and also in its wide scope of general <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> training, that the new establishment was modelled by its founder. In 1495 Elphinstone procured a royal charter assigning to academic purposes certain <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> revenues and conceding to the new <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> all the <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privileges</a> enjoyed by the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, St. Andrews, and <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>. <a href="../cathen/02609c.htm">Hector Boece</a>, professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, was appointed first principal of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, which was established in what is now known as Old Aberdeen, near the ancient <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of St. Machar. In 1593, George Keith, fifth Earl Marshal of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, founded a second <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> (hence called Marischal College) in the new town of Aberdeen, and granted to it the buildings of the dispossessed Black (Dominican), Grey (Franciscan), and <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">White (Carmelite) Friars</a> as <a href="../cathen/05421b.htm">endowment</a>. The two <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> were united for a time (from 1640 until after the Restoration), and many schemes for their permanent reunion were <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in the 18th century; but it was not until 1859 that their fusion was finally affected, after much local opposition. New professorships and lectureships have been recently founded, and at Marischal College, now the seat of the faculties of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a>, a scheme of building extension on a great scale is at present (1905) being carried out. The number of students is about 700, and the number of professors 24.
