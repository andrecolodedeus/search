<h1>The University of Bologna</h1>  

<p>A tradition of the thirteenth century attributed the foundation of this <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> to Theodosius II (433); but this legend is now generally rejected. The authentic "Habita", issued by <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a> in 1158, was at best only an implicit recognition of the existence of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Bologna, and the bull of <a href="../cathen/04018a.htm">Clement III</a> (1189), though it speaks of "masters and scholars", has no reference to a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> organization. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, in fact, developed out of the "Schools of the Liberal Arts" which flourished at Bologna early in the eleventh century. An important feature of the general <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> given in these <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> was the <em>Dictamen</em>, or Art of composition which included rules for drawing up briefs and other legal documents. The study of grammar and rhetoric was closely connected with the study of law. At the same time, the political, commercial and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> growth of the Lombard cities created a demand for legal instruction. <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, long the home of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>, lost is prestige through its conflict with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, and Bologna was its successor. Towards the close of the eleventh century Pepo is mentioned in connection with the revived study of the "Digest"; but it was <a href="../cathen/08168a.htm">Irnerius</a> who began the study of the entire "Corpus Juris Civillis" and organized the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of law as distinct from the arts <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> (1100-30). Along with this revival of the Civil Law came the epoch-making compilation of the <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a> (or Bendedictine) <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Gratian. The "Decretum Gratiani" (q.v.) published about 1140, became at once the recognized textbook of canon law. Bologna was thus in its origin, a "jurist" <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. The work of <a href="../cathen/08168a.htm">Irnerius</a> and Gratian was continued by such men as Odopedus (d. 1300), Joannes Andrea (1270-1348), St. Raymond of Pennafort (1175-1275), and Ricardus Angelicus, who later became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03657a.htm">Chichester</a> (about middle of thirteenth century).

<p>The fame of its professors drew to Bologna students from all parts of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and from nearly every country of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. It is said that their number at the beginning of the thirteenth century was 10,000. Bologna was known as the "Mater studiorum", and its motto, "Bononia docet", was literally <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. The foreign (non-Bolognese) students formed two "universities"; that of the Cismontanes and that of the Ultramontanes. The former comprised seventeen "Nations", the latter, eighteen, including the English. The nations were organized on a plan similar to that of the guilds. Each framed its own statutes, elected its own "Consiliari", and held its own meetings. The <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> was elected by the students. The masters, also, were grouped in guilds or colleges. In the examination of candidates for degrees, the authority of the masters was supreme; in other matters the students had full control. In the conflicts that often arose between them and the city, the students enforced their claims by emigrating to other towns &mdash; Vincenza (1204), Arezzo (1215), Padua (1222), Sienna (1321). Appeal was sometimes taken to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who as a rule decided in favour of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. Notable among these <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> interventions was the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> (1217).

<p>Bologna in its earliest organization was a "student" <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>: professors were hired by the students to give instruction. The lectures were either "ordinary" or "extraordinary", a distinction which corresponded with that between the more essential and the less essential of the law-texts (Rashdall). Ordinary lectures were reserved for the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>; the extraordinary might be given by a student as part of his preparation for the baccalaureate. (See <a href="../cathen/01756c.htm">BACHELOR OF ARTS</a>.) This classification of teachers survives in the modern German <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. At Bologna, no examination was required for the Bachelor's degree; permission to lecture was granted the student after a five years' course in law. For the Licentiate, the candidate was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to pass a private, and for the Doctorate a public, examination (<em>Conventus, Inceptio</em>). The examinations and the conferring of degrees belonged originally to the masters; but in 1219 <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> prescribed that no one should receive the Doctorate without the consent of the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of Bologna. In 1292 <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a> decreed that all who were licensed <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of Bologna should have the right, without further examination or <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>, to teach everywhere. These enactments not only enhanced the value of the degree, but also affected the organization of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. Functions hitherto exercised by private corporations passed into the hands of an official commissioned by <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">public authority</a>, and that authority was <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>. The degree system of Bologna was henceforth the same as that which had already been established at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; and these two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> became the models upon which the later <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> were organized.

<p>The development of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at Bologna had as one result the reduction of the Liberal Arts to a position of secondary importance. On the other hand, two factors in the situation favoured the Arts and made possible a new growth in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, namely, the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> philosophy and the introduction of mathematics from the Arabian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The physics and physiology of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> formed the basis of the study of <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a>, while mathematics opened the way to <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a>, and eventually to <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>. Among the physicians of note in Bologna were a number of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, one of whom, Nicolaus de Farnham, became (1241) <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>. Churchmen were forbidden to study medicine by <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> (1219). But there was no regularly organized <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of medicine until Thaddeus of Florence began his teaching, about 1260. From that time onward the medical faculty grew in importance. Surgery received special attention; dissection was practised, and the foundations of modern <a href="../cathen/01457e.htm">anatomy</a> were laid by <a href="../cathen/10476b.htm">Mundinus</a> (1275-1326). Closely allied with the work in medicine was the study of <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a>. A famous astrologist, Cecco d'Ascoli (d. 1327), declared that a physician without <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a> would be like an eye without the power of vision. The scientific study of <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a> was founded by the investigations of <a href="../cathen/11134b.htm">Novara</a> and his disciple <a href="../cathen/04352b.htm">Copernicus</a> (1473-1543). Both medical and mathematical studies were influenced by Arabian scholarship, in particular by that of <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> and <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a>. As these were also <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, their theories came to be part of the scholasticism of Bologna, and their authority was scarcely inferior to that of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>.

<p>Theology had long been taught in the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; but the faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was established by <a href="../cathen/08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a> in 1360. Its chancellor was the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bologna, and its <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> depended upon him rather than upon the student body. The faculty received many privileges from <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban V</a>, <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a>, and their successors. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, in fact, favoured the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in every possible way. <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> sent it to the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a>; <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, various bulls and encyclicals. Among the benefactors were <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>, <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a>, <a href="../cathen/08019a.htm">Innocent VII</a>, <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> and <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a>. <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> founded (1372), in connection with the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, the <em>Collegium Gregorianum</em> for poor students of medicine and philosophy. Other colleges with similar scope were established by <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> (see list in Moroni). One of the most important was the College of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (<em>Casa Spagnuola</em>, or <em>Collegio Magiore</em>), which owed its existence and endowment to Cardinal Albornoz (1364). The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> at Bologna took an active part in the direction of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and eventually became the supreme authority. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, also the student body lost its control, and the various <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were consolidated in one <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> organization.

<p>In the development of modern literature and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> Bologna took an important part. The famous <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Cardinal Bessarion</a>, a leader in the Renaisance movement, was <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> from 1451 to 1455. Under his influence classical studies flourished in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and Humanists like Filelfo (1398-1481) and <a href="../cathen/07053a.htm">Guarino</a> were among its professors. To these should be added, in more recent times, the great Messofanti (1774-1849). In the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, especially, Bologna points to a long list of distinguished men; the anatomists Achillini (1463-1512), Vesalius (1514-64), Varoli (1542-75), and Malpighi (1628-94), the botanist <a href="../cathen/01281b.htm">Aldrovandi</a> (1522-1607), and the <a href="../cathen/12047a.htm">physicist</a> Galvani (1737-98) are among the most illustrious. The number of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who taught at Bologna is also remarkable, including Novella, daughter of Joannes Andrea the jurist, Laura Bassi (1711-78), and <a href="../cathen/01214b.htm">Maria Agnesi</a> (1718-99), mathematicians, and Clotilda Tambroni (1758-1817), professor of Greek.

<p>During the <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleonic</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> suffered considerably: chairs were suppressed, and the existence of the entire <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was often endangered. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, in particular <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> came to its assistance, reorganized the faculties, and provided generously for the continuation of scientific work. Their control, however, ceased when the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a> were merged in the present <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> now comprises the faculties of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and letters, mathematics and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and medicine, with <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of pharmacy, agriculture, and engineering. The professors and instructors number 190; the students 1800. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> founded in 1605 by <a href="../cathen/01281b.htm">Aldrovandi</a>, contains 250,000 volumes. One of the most important institutes connected with the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> is the Academy of Science, established in 1690 by the generous Count Marsigli, and reorganized by <a href="../cathen/12134a.htm">Pius VIII</a> in 1829.
