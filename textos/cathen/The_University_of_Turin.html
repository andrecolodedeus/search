<h1>The University of Turin</h1>  

<p>The University of Turin was founded in 1404, when the lectures at <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a> and Pavia were interrupted by the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. Some of the professors of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, medicine, and arts at <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a> obtained permission from Louis of Savoy-Acaia to continue their courses at <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>. This prince had obtained from the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, in 1405, the pontifical privilege for a <em>studium generale</em>, and in 1412 the permission of the emperor was likewise granted. In the following year <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a> confirmed the concessions of <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> rendered <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> which had disturbed the <em>studium</em> of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>. The <em>studium</em> then comprised three faculties: <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, law (canon and civil), medicine (with arts and philosophy). The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> was always chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. As at Bologna, the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> continued for a long time to be chosen from their own body by the students, who in 1679 represented thirteen nations. The professors' salaries were paid by the communes of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>; but from 1420 the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> also contributed, and at a later period the dukes. In the seventeenth century the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> levied a tax on the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Under Duke Amedo VIII, the State began to restrict the autonomy of the <em>studium</em> by means of <em>riformatori</em> and subjected the professors and students in criminal matters to ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. From 1427 to 1436 the seat of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was temporarily transferred to Chieri and Savignano (1434). The number of salaried professors in the years 1456 and 1533 was twenty-five (only two of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>), but the number of lecturers was much greater; e.g., in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty (1427-36) nineteen masters &mdash; eleven <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and eight <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> &mdash; are named. Among the distinguished Professors of that age were the jurisconsult Claudio Beisello, a noted translator of many Greek classics, Pietro Carol Cristoforo Castiglione e Grassi, the physician Guainiero, and the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> Francesco della Rovere, afterwards <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>.

<p>In 1536 the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was closed, owing to the Franco-Spanish <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>; in 1560 it was re-established at <a href="../cathen/10478a.htm">Mondov&igrave;</a> by Duke Emanuele Filiberto back to <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, with <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> permitting increasing state interference in the affairs of the university. Ut acquired a great reputation, which, however declined under Charles Emanmuel I (1580-1630), who, owing to the expenses of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, had to suspend his financial contributions to the Studium. In the seventeenth century the officials of the respective nations granted the students the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to interrupt the professors' lectures. Studies naturally languished. In 1687 there were 3 professors of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, 13 of law, 10 of medicine, 6 of arts. The art course did not then include the belles-lettres, which were taught in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>. Victor Amedeo II granted a new constitution to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> (1720-29), which thence forward was a purely state institution; he also had the present building erected after the design of Gio. Antonio Ricca. A royal official was appointed to supervise the observance of the Statutes and to act as a censor of books. From 1729 the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> was chosen from among the professors. At the same time the Collegio delle Provincie was established for students not natives of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> contained a regulation strictly <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliging</a> the students to be present in the oratory of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> on holy days of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. On the other hand, the king ordered the professors of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> to observe neutrality concerning Gallicanism.

<p>At the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> declined rapidly; the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/01457e.htm">anatomy</a>, for instance became a political club. Under <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> (1800-14) the studies were reorganized according to french methods; several new chairs were established, and the revival in this sense was continued by Prospero Balbo. In 1821 the students, under the impulse of the constitutional movement, rebelled, and severe measures were adopted. Lectures were continued outside of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. In the third decade of the nineteenth century there were notable agitations in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty in favour of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>, and agitations brought about by the moralist Dettorri, who was afterwards exiled. During the Revolution of July 1830, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was closed, and the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> dispersed among different cities. In 1845 the curriculum was re-organized. In the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty chairs of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>, oratory, and <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">Biblical exegesis</a> were established. In 1860 this faculty was, here as elsewhere, abolished.

<p>Among the distinguished professors of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> since the sixteenth century the jurist Gian Francesco Balbo and the physician Giovanni Nevizzano are worthy of mention; after the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, the jurists Cuiacius and Pancirolus, the physicians Blessed Giovenale Ancina (afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13405c.htm">Saluzzo</a>) and Lucille Filalteo; the Greek scholar Teodoro Rendio, was called to the Collegio Greco by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>. Distinguished in the eighteenth century were <a href="../cathen/06733b.htm">Vincenzo Gravina</a> and Luigi Fantoni the jurisconsults, the Augustinian Giulio Accetta in mathematics, the <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarist</a> Giambattista Beecaria, in physics, the <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabite</a> <a href="../cathen/06471b.htm">Sigismondo Gerdil</a>, in ethics, Giambattista Carburi and Vitaliano Donati in medicine, the historian Carlo Denino, and Francesco Antonio Chionio, the professor of canon law whose work "De regimine ecclesiae" caused <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> by reducing all religion to internal worship, and leaving the control of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>; in the nineteenth century: Father Peyron, professor of Oriental languages a celebrated Egyptologist, the philologists Vallauri and Fabretti, the mathematician and <a href="../cathen/12047a.htm">physicist</a> Galileo Ferrari, the historian Balbo, the physiologist Cesare Lombroso. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> has 22 chairs of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> with 18 professors and 20 docents; 24 chairs of physical and mathematical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> with 17 professors and 17 docents; 28 chairs of medicine with 25 professors and 89 docents; 22 chairs of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and literature with 19 professors and 21 docents. In connection with the medical faculty are a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of pharmacy, various clinics, laboratories, etc., as well as the laboratories, cabinets, and <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> observatory of the other scientific faculties. In 1910-11 there were 2204 students enrolled.
