<h1>The Ursulines of Quebec</h1>  

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Quebec is the oldest institution of learning for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in North America. Its history begins on 1 August, 1639, when its first members landed in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, thirty-one years after <a href="../cathen/03567a.htm">Champlain</a> had founded Quebec (1608) and only four after his death. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was established by <a href="../cathen/09668a.htm">Marie Huyard de l'Incarnation</a>, declared Venerable by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (1874), and Madame de la Peltrie, a rich <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Alen on in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>. The former, after ten years of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowhood</a>, had joined the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>. Her first biographer was her son, Dom Claude Martin, a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, who died in the odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, in 1696. His "Life of the Venerable Mother of the Incarnation" was approved (1677), by the venerable Bishop Laval. <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> (Etats d'oraison, IX) calls Marie de l'Incarnation "the Theresa of her time and of the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>." The letters royal sanctioning the foundation and signed by Louis XIII are <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1639. After three years spent in the Lower Town, near <a href="../cathen/03567a.htm">Champlain's</a> <em>Habitation</em>, the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> entered (1642) the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> built on the ground they still occupy, conceded to them (1639) by the Company of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a>. Their first pupils were Indians, with whom they succeeded better than the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> with their native boys. Marie de l'Incarnation mastered the difficult Indian languages thoroughly, composed dictionaries in <a href="../cathen/01311b.htm">Algonquin</a> and <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>, also a sacred history in the former, and a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> in the latter idiom. The first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was burned in 1650, but was soon rebuilt. The Constitutions, written by <a href="../cathen/08752c.htm">Father J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Lalemant</a>, uncle of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, <a href="../cathen/08752b.htm">Gabriel Lalemant</a>, combined the rules of the two Congregations of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, and were observed until Bishop Laval decided (1681) in favor of the former, which binds its members by a fourth <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to teach girls.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> shared at all times the country's fate. It was threatened by the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> in 1661-2, when one of its <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, the Sulpician Vignal, was slain and devoured near <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> by those savages. It underwent the siege and bombardment of Quebec by Phips (1690) and by Wolfe (1759). After the fateful battle of 13 Sept., 1759, the French hero, Montcalm, was buried by night in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. The first English governor, Murray, used part of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> as his headquarters. On that occasion the rations served to the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> for nursing the wounded and sick saved them from perishing of starvation. The governors and viceroys, both English and French, were always friendly to the institution.

<p>The foundress, who died in 1672, one year after Madame de la Peltrie, practised devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and had established it in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> years before the revelation to the blessed Margaret Mary. The first celebration of the feast in the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> took place in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> 18 June, 1700 (<em>Mandement</em> of Bishop de St-Vallier, 30 March, 1700. The register of the Confraternity of the Sacred Heart begins in 1716. <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> (1718) enriched it with <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. The first superior elected (1760) after the conquest was Esther Wheelwright, a New England captive, rescued from the Abenakis by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Bigot, and a prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of the first governor, <a href="../cathen/15311a.htm">Vaudreuil</a>. Besides the French, the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, Scotch and American elements in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> have given distinguished subjects to this <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, prominent among whom was Mother Cecilia O'Conway of the Incarnation, the first Philadelphia <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>, one of Mother Seton's earliest associates. The list of alumnae is not less remarkable. Conspicuous among its pupils were Jeanne Le Ber, the saintly "recluse of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>", and <a href="../cathen/15736c.htm">Venerable Mother D'Youville</a>, foundress of the Grey Sisters at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. The Quebec <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> founded <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> at <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a> (1697), Roberval (1882), Stanstead (1884), and Rimouski, with normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> (1906), besides sending missionaries to <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> (1822), Charlestown  (Boston) (1824), Galveston (1849), and <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">Montana</a> (1893). During the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> several French refugees were <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, the most notable being Abb&eacute; L.-P. Desjardins, who died in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Through him were procured the valuable <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Philippe de Champaigne, <a href="../cathen/09106a.htm">Lebrun</a>, Collin de Vermont, <a href="../cathen/02516a.htm">Peter of Cortona</a>, and others, that adorn the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>.
