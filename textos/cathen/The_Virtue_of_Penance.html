<h1>The Virtue of Penance</h1>  

<p>Penance (<em>poenitentia</em>) designates (1) a virtue; (2) a sacrament of the New Law; (3) a canonical punishment inflicted according to the earlier <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a>; (4) a work of satisfaction enjoined upon the recipient of the sacrament. These have as their common centre the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> must repent and as far as possible make reparation to Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Repentance, i.e., heartfelt sorrow with the firm purpose of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> no more, is thus the prime condition on which depends the value of whatever the sinner may do or suffer by way of expiation. The <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a> will be treated in a separate article; here, we shall deal only with penance considered as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><em>Penance</em> here is a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> moral virtue whereby the sinner is disposed to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as an offence against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to a firm purpose of amendment and satisfaction. The principal act in the exercise of this virtue is the detestation of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in general nor of that which others commit, but of one's own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The motive of this detestation is that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> offends <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: to regret <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> deeds on account of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> or physical suffering the social loss, or the action of human <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which they entail, is natural; but such sorrow does not suffice for penance. On the other hand, the resolve to amend, while certainly <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, is not sufficient of itself, i.e., without <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> already committed; such a resolve, in fact, would be meaningless; it would profess obedience to <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a> in the future while disregarding the claims of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in the matter of past transgression. "Be converted, and do penance for all your iniquities. . . . Cast away from you all your transgressions . . . and make to yourselves a new heart, and a new spirit" (<a href="../bible/eze018.htm#vrs30">Ezekiel 18:30-31</a>; cf. Joel, 2:12; <a href="../bible/jer008.htm#vrs6">Jeremiah 8:6</a>). In the same spirit <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a> exhorts his hearers: "Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of penance" (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#vrs8">Matthew 3:8</a>). Such too is the teaching of Christ as expressed in the parables of the Prodigal Son and of the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">Publican</a>; while the <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Magdalen</a> who "washed out her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> with her tears" of sorrow, has been for all ages the type of the repentant sinner. <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a>, following the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (Summa, III, Q. lxxxv, a. 1), regard penance as truly a virtue, though they have disputed much regarding its place among the virtues. Some have classed it with the virtue of charity, others with the virtue of religion, others again as a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Cajetan seems to have considered it as belonging to all three; but most <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> agree with St. Thomas (ibid., a. 2) that penance is a distinct virtue (<em>virtus specialis</em>). The detestation of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a praiseworthy act, and in penance this detestation proceeds from a special motive, i.e., because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> offends <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/09418b.htm">De Lugo</a>, "De paenitentiae virtute"; Palmieri, "De paenitentia", Rome, 1879; theses I-VII.).
<h2>Necessity</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> expressly declares (Sess. XIV, c.i) that penance was at all times <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the remission of grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> have questioned whether this necessity obtains in virtue of the positive command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or independently of such positive precept. The weight of authority is in favour of the latter opinion; moreover, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> state that in the present order of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself cannot forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, if there be no real repentance (<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, <a href="../summa/4086.htm#article2">III:86:2</a>; Cajetan, ibid.; Palmieri, op. cit., thesis VII). In the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> (<a href="../bible/eze018.htm#vrs24">Ezekiel 18:24</a>) life is denied to the man who does iniquity; even "his justices which he has done, shall not be remembered"; and Christ restates the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, saying (<a href="../bible/luk013.htm#vrs5">Luke 13:5</a>): "except you do penance, you shall all likewise perish." In the New Law, therefore, repentance is as <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> as it was in the Old, repentance that includes reformation of life, grief for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and willingness to perform satisfaction. In the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Dispensation</a> this act of repentance has been subjected by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to the judgment and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whensoever there is question of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed after the reception of Baptism (Council of Trent, sess. XIV, c. i), and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> acting in the name of Christ not only declares that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven, but actually and judicially forgives them, if the sinner already repentant subjects his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to the "power of the keys", and is willing to make fitting satisfaction for the wrong he has done.
