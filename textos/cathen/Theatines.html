<h1>Theatines</h1>  

<p>(CLERICS REGULAR)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order of men, founded by Gaetano dei Conti di Tiene, Paolo Consiglieri, Bonifacio da Colle, and Giovanni Pietro Carafa, afterwards <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Pope Paul IV</a>. Carafa was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03659a.htm">Chieti</a> (Theate), a city of the Abruzzi in Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, from which the congregation adopted its specific name, to distinguish it from other congregations (<a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a>, <a href="../cathen/14140a.htm">Somaschi</a>, Caracciolini, etc.) modelled upon it. Gaetano <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> his order to the Cross, which he adopted as its emblem, and the foundation took place on the feast of the Finding of the Holy Cross, 3 May, 1524. It was approved on 24 June, 1524, by <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Exponi Nobis". On 14 Sept., feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, St. Gaetano and his companions made solemn profession before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> altar of St. Peter's, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in the presence of Mgr. Giovanni Battista Bonziano, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03399a.htm">Caserta</a>, special <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> delegate. The chief object of the order was to recall the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to an edifying life and the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> to the practice of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. St. Gaetano and his companions <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> endeavoured to combat the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Martin Luther</a>, which, having gained a foothold in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, then threatened <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. They founded <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> (among them the celebrated <em>Divino Amore</em>) and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, devoted themselves to preaching the Gospel, and reforming lax <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. Through their good example <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> were induced to better living.

<p>Notwithstanding their severe rule of life and strict <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty, the congregation rapidly developed, and soon numbered among its members illustrious names of the Italian aristocracy (<a href="../cathen/15397a.htm">Vezzosi</a>, "Illustri scrittori Teatini", Rome, 1780). They founded many beautiful churches, among them that of S.Andrea della Valle in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, a gift of Costanza Piccolomini D'Aragona, Duchess of <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a>. This church is a masterpiece of Carlo Maderna, and contains several <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="../cathen/05102b.htm">Domenichino</a>. The Theatines were invited to <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>, Florence; <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, <a href="../cathen/11419b.htm">Palermo</a>, <a href="../cathen/10216a.htm">Messina</a>, <a href="../cathen/09107d.htm">Lecce</a>, etc., by the authorities of these places. They also attained a great development in foreign countries. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, through the efforts of <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Cardinal Mazarin</a>, they built the Church of St. Anne la Royale opposite the Louvre in 1644. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, under Philip II, the Theatine Cardinal Paolo Burali d'Arezzo, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a>, filled various embassies at the command of the viceroy of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. In <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> John IV, in 1648, gave the Theatines a splendid house and college for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of noble youth. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, under <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, <a href="../cathen/06631b.htm">Goldwell</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01766a.htm">St. Asaph</a>, entered the order of Theatines (see <a href="../cathen/06631b.htm">THOMAS GOLDWELL</a>).

<p>The Theatines were the first to found <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> missions in foreign lands, as in: Golconda, Ava, Pegu, Mingrelia, the Islands of Sunda, Borneo, Sumatra, the history of which was written by the Theatine Bartolomeo Ferro (Missioni Teatine nelle Indie Orientali); Georgia, <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, in which latter country Father Galano, author of the history of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Church, negotiated and concluded the reconciliation and union of that Church with the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a>; <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> and in many other places, as is shown by Theatine <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from 1530 till the end of the eighteenth century. In the nineteenth century the order began to decline, and in 1860, through the well-known suppression of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, it was reduced to a shadow of its former greatness. In accordance with the spirit of its rule, it had never acquired possessions and is the only order which feels the consequences of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of suppression.

<p>Father Francesco di Paola Ragonesi, general of the order and the last surviving representative of its ancient traditions, restored the Church of S. Andrea della Valle to its former splendour, by his care and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> aided by the munificence of Comm. Filippo Giove Romano. The Theatines maintain a flourishing mission at <a href="../cathen/05208c.htm">Durango</a> in <a href="../cathen/04129a.htm">Colorado</a>, U.S.A. <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, in a Motu Proprio of 15 December, 1909, decreed the union of the ancient Congregation of the Regular Theatine Clergy with the youthful Spanish <a href="../cathen/07407c.htm">Congregation of the Holy Family</a> at Barcelona. Besides the two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, Gaetano, invoked for the interposition of Providence, and Andrea <a href="../cathen/02149c.htm">Avellino</a>, against sudden death, the order furnished one <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> (Giovanni Pietro Carafa), 250 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>: Blessed Giovanni Marinoni, Blessed Paolo Burali d'Arezzo, Blessed Giuseppe Maria Tomasi, Giovanni Bernardino Scotti, Francesco and Domenico Pignatelli, Giuseppe Capece-Zurlo, Francesco Maria Banditi, and Ferdinando Pignatelli, the last named created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>. <a href="../cathen/15397a.htm">Father Anton Francesco Vezzosi</a> (whom <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a> wished to make <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, but chose instead Fr. Ganganelli of the <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a> who succeeded him in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> as <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a>) treats of the illustrious men of the order in his work "I scrittori de' chierici regolari detti Teatini", Rome, 1780. The last famous Theatine was the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, <em>litt&eacute;rateur</em>, and great sacred orator, <a href="../cathen/15343b.htm">Father Gioacchino Ventura dei baroni di Raulica</a>, a <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilian</a>. He preached and wrote in both Italian and French. His most celebrated work is his funeral oration on the death of Daniel O'Connell. He was the friend of the most illustrious men of his day, among them the <a href="../cathen/08765a.htm">Abb&eacute; de Lamennais</a> whom he sought to save for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He died at <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a> in 1860.


<h2>Theatine nuns</h2>

<p>Theatine Nuns, a religious congregation of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> &#151; oblates and <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermitesses</a> &#151; existing in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, founded under the name of Sisters of the immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary, by Venerable Ursula Benincasa. This illustrious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who, according to Padre Silos ("Istorie Theatine", <a href="../cathen/11419b.htm">Palermo</a>, 1666, XII, p. 657), united in herself the spirit of Gertrude, of <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">Catherine of Siena</a>, of Brigid, and of Paula, was born at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, 7 August, 1547. Her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were Girolamo Benincasa and Vincenza Genuina. Her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> came originally from <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, and had given to the arts, to the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of great distinction. Venerable Ursula herself displayed great talent; while still a young girl, she comprehended the most recondite meanings of Latin books and of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. Her inclination to the monastic life was strongly pronounced from her earliest years. Many of her biographies (that of Maggio; Flaminio da Latera, "Compendio della storia degli ordini regolari" s.v. "Theatine dell'immacolata Concezione"; Bonanni in "Catalogo delle Vergine dedicate a Dio") state that when ten years old she attempted to enter the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of S. Maria di Gerusalemme, which flourished at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> under the rule of <a href="../cathen/04004a.htm">St. Clare</a>, and after various <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> and trials she founded the Congregation of the Theatine Oblate Sisters. Her sisters, among them Christina who became the first superioress, and some of her nieces formed the community. Little by little, other <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> joined them, to the number of sixty.

<p>The date of this formation is fixed by some as 1581, according to others (including so weighty an authority as Padre Bonanni, S.J.) as 1583. The latter <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> is the better substantiated, for in 1581 Ven. Ursula merely determined the spot on which she intended a church to be erected; it was in fact built near Castel S. Elmo, with the help of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Gregorio Navarro, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Francavilla, whom she had told of a vision in which the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> had commanded her to build a church in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Most Holy Conception of Mary. At this period, having created much popular excitement by her visions, her <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasies</a>, and the loftiness of her teaching, and having attracted enthusiastic admiration and envenomed <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>, she was accused of being possessed by a devil and was therefore summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> and Tarugi, <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a> and illustrious <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, received her and took her to have audience of <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> at <a href="../cathen/06243a.htm">Frascati</a>, 3 May, 1582. By the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> authority she was placed under the <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual direction</a> of <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a>, who subjected her to the most severe trials; he was constantly astonished by her <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. In 1583 the foundation proper took place, under the protection of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, <a href="../cathen/13356b.htm">St. Joseph</a>, <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">St. Michael the Archangel</a>, and St. Peter.

<p>The rules of the Congregation of the Oblates are those of the active life of St. Martha, with simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. They include recitation of the Office of the Blessed Virgin and the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> daily; one hour of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in common at morning, besides the recitation of the Veni Creator and the De Profundis at None; one hour of adoration before the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, exposed in the church every Friday, with singing of appropriate <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>. In addition to the ordinary <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the Oblates fast on the vigils of the feasts of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>, the Purification, and the Immaculate Conception, and they are exhorted to wear the hairshirt on Fridays. The daily recitation of one-third of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is also prescribed. They are recommended to labour with their hands, to practise the common life, poverty and the other virtues. The habit is that of the Theatine <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>: a white tunic under a black garment with wide sleeves and girdle of wool; on the head a white veil without wimple, the place of which is supplied by the collar of the outer garment, like that of the Theatine <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> (<a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> and Bonanni).

<p>The Theatine Hermitesses (<em>Romite Teatine</em>) were founded in 1617. As Venerable Ursula wished to completely withdraw from the world she took thirty-three companions, in memory of the thirty-three years of Christ upon earth, and retired to a hermitage. The rules of the Hermitesses are much like those of the Oblates as regards works of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; but the former religious follow the contemplative life of <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">St. Magdalene</a>. In addition to their solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, their constitution imposes on them great austerities. They are bound to perpetual abstinence from flesh meat except in case of illness, to fast on the vigils of feasts of the Blessed Virgin and with still greater rigour on the vigils of the Immaculate Conception, the <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">Ascension</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>. They also fast every Saturday and on the last two days of Carnival, besides the ordinary <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> of the church. They are bound to keep the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> exposed for five hours every Friday, with continual adoration by five religious, and to practise penance regularly. The age of reception to the hermitage is twenty, and the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> lasts two years. On admission to solemn profession, a religious may converse with her nearest relatives for one day, but must not expect to see them again. Their enclosure is of the strictest, and they hold no communication with anyone except those charged with supplying them with food, which is given to them through a turnstile. Their habit is of white cloth with a leather girdle, light blue <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> and mantle, black veil and wimple like other <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> (Bonanni, op. cit.). The building of the Hermitage was begun on 10 June, 1633, and completed in 1667. The rules of the Hermitesses and those of the Oblates were approved by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> in 1623.

<p>The Theatine Sisters, more particularly the Oblates, were under the government and <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual direction</a> of the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> Oratory, by the request of the Abbot Navarro mentioned above, until 1633. In this year the Theatine Order, under pressing and insistent solicitation of important personages, among them <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Pope Urban VIII</a>, undertook this charge, under the generalship of Padre Matteo Santomagno, who was the depositary of Ven. Ursula's last wishes and desires. Oblates and Hermitesses practised fervent and incessant <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to avert from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> the terrible chastisements which Ven. Ursula by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> foresaw in her <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>. The life of the Oblates is active, that of the Hermitesses contemplative. These institutes &#151; like many others which have not lived in touch with the world through <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and the like &#151; continued to live and prosper while the days were less <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> than now, and their members were regarded with wonder as victims expiating with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of humanity; but through the spoliation of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> they have now almost disappeared and are reduced to a shadow of their former greatness. Venerable Ursula's rule and the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> practice of the Blue <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">Scapular</a>, which she introduced, are still observed.
