<h1>Thebes</h1>  

<p>(THEBAE)

<p><a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">Titular see</a> of Thebais Secunda, suffragan of Ptolemais, and the seat of a <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> diocese. Thebes was the No-Amon of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the Nouit-Amen of the Egyptians (City or Kingdom of Amon), the Nia of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, and the Diospolis of the Greeks, which is the exact translation of Nouit-Amen. The Egyptians also called it Per or Pi-Amen, the dwelling of Amon, and also Apet, whence, with the article Ta before the feminine name Apet, is derived Ta-Apet, or Tape, as it is called by the modern <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a>, the <em>Thebai</em> of the Greeks. Thebes is mentioned three times in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> under the name of No-Amon in the Hebrew text, which the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> each time renders incorrectly by Alexandria. Nahum (iii, 8-10) refers to the victories of Assurbanipal, King of Ninive, over Tanutamen, King of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, as we now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from the cylinders of that sovereign (G. Smith, "History of Assurbanipal", 52-56). It is thought that Jeremias (xlvi, 25) and Ezechiel (xxx, 14-16) allude to the two campaigns of <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> against Thebes, which took place in 583 and 588 B.C.

<p>Originally a mere borough, Thebes grew by degrees, and as early as the twelfth dynasty its sovereigns dominated <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Thenceforth also its god Amon-Ra, to whom the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">pharaohs</a> had erected numerous monuments, became the foremost of the gods. halted for a time by the invasion of the Hyksos, the growth of <a href="../cathen/14562b.htm">Thebes</a> continued under the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">pharaohs</a> of the eighteenth and especially those of the nineteenth dynasty, who extended their domination to the sources of the Euphrates. When the sovereigns of <a href="../cathen/14562b.htm">Thebes</a> had become degenerate they were replaced by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the god Amon, who constituted themselves the twenty-first dynasty. They disappeared in turn and the capital of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> was then transferred to the Delta. The city began to fall away, especially after the Assyrian armies had captured and devastated it in 668 and 664 B.C. and <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> had twice rifled it of its treasures. However, as long as there were <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> sovereigns, even under the Ptolemies, work was done at the temple of Karnak, which was only abandoned under the Roman domination. Thebes then became a place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> and sight-seeing. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> established their churches in the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> dwelt everywhere, preferably in the ancient <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a>. The great earthquake of 27 B.C. caused some damage, but that which ruined the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> of Karnak must have occurred two or three centuries later.

<p>A see was established at <a href="../cathen/14562b.htm">Thebes</a> at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. Ammonius of Diospolis assisted at the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> in 325, unless he was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Diospolis Parva (Harnack, "Mission and Ausbreitung des Christentums", II); Maletius was a partisan of Arius, according to Philostorgius and Nicetas Choniates ("Thesaurus orthodoxae fidei", V, 7); Hero <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a> under <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julius the Apostate</a>, according to Philostorgius (Hist. eccl., VII, 13); Stephen was <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> at the time of Photius, and Kalta was Jacobite <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> in 1086 (<a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a>, "Oriens christ.", II, 611). The Coptic diocese, created in 1895, has 15,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to 300,000 Jacobite <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> and about 3,000,000 <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>. There are 31 <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 35 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, besides 6 which belong to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, 18 stations, 26 primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with about 500 pupils, 4 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, 3 of <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>, and 1 of native Sisters. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> which is used by the three <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> has 17 students and is situated at Tahtah, the residence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14562b.htm">Thebes</a>.

<p>The ruins of <a href="../cathen/14562b.htm">Thebes</a> are among the most beautiful in the world. The city was situated on both banks of the Nile, which is more than two miles wide at this point. On the right bank was the temple of Luxor, built by king Amenothes III and Rameses II, the great temple of Amon, and the great hypostylic hall of Karnak, the work of the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">pharaohs</a> Rameses I, Seti I, and Rameses II, and which is 37 feet broad by 169 feet deep. A veritable fortress of 134 colossal columns divides it into three <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a>, forming a hall which has not its like in the world. The <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> of Luxor and Karnak were joined by an alley nearly two miles long by about 3 3/4 miles wide, bordered by rams or criocephalous sphinxes. On the left side is Quournah, which begins the line of <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> of which the Ramesseum is almost in the centre and Medinet-Habou at the southern extremity. A line drawn around all these monuments either from the right or the left bank describes a circuit of nearly 8 3/4 miles. Now Diodorus Siculus (I, 45) and Strabo (XVII, 46) give almost the same dimensions to the Diospolis of the first century before Christ. But in the time of its real splendour, according to Eustathius and Stephanus Byzantius, confirmed by other geographers and modern discoveries, Thebes was almost 400 stadia in circumference, or nearly 28 miles. It is probable, however, that these figures included not only the extent of the city, but also the entire territory of the commune.
