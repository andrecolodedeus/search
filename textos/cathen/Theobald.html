<h1>Theobald</h1>  

<p>(T<font size=-2>EDBALD</font>.)

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>; d. 18 April, 1161. He was a Norman by descent and became a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at <a href="../cathen/02379b.htm">Bec</a> late in the eleventh or early in the twelfth century. In 1127 he was made prior, and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> in 1137. On 28 Dec., 1138, he was elected <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 8 January following. He went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for his <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> and took part in the second Lateran Council. He <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a wise and capable <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, devout in his private life, charitable, and a lover of learning. During the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> he adhered to King Stephen, whom he <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a>, though for a time he was at the Empress Maud's court, and always worked for the Angevin succession.

<p>In his household, he collected many young men of ability, including his successor <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas of Canterbury</a>, and he encouraged the formation of scholars and statesmen of a new type. He was the first to introduce <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> into <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and founded a law <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, inducing the famous jurist Roger Vacarius to come and lecture there. This introduction of <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> had important effects on the fortunes of the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and incidentally led to the establishment of the Inns of Court to maintain the national body of law against the newly introduced code. Theobald suffered many difficulties owing to the appointment of his suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Henry of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>. Among these was the appointment of St. William of York as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">that see</a>, which Theobald felt bound to oppose. <a href="../cathen/03478a.htm">Celestine II</a> did not reappoint Henry of <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a> as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> and finally in 1150, or possibly before, Theobald was named <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> by Blessed <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugene III</a>, probably on the recommendation of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> (Ep. 238).

<p>When the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> summoned the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to a council at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> the king forbade them to go, whereupon Theobald defied the king and went. Though he saved the king from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was confiscated and he was banished. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> then put <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>, which was disregarded except in <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, and finally the king and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> were reconciled in 1148. In 1151 Theobald held a legatine council in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. In the following year, acting on <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority, he refused to crown Eustace, the king's son, and was again compelled to seek flight. While in Normandy he reconciled Henry of Anjou to Stephen, with the result that in 1153 the Treaty of Wallingford ended the Civil War. On Stephen's death Theobald <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> Henry II, and during the rest of his life, though not without anxiety for the future of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he maintained good relations with the Court, especially with his former disciple Thomas, who had now become chancellor. He expressed to <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a> his hope that Thomas would succeed him. Throughout his pontificate he had continual trouble with the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/03699a.htm">Christchurch</a>, but in every instance his action was justified finally. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in Canterbury Cathedral, where eighteen years afterwards his body was found incorrupt.
