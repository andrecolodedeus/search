<h1>Theocracy</h1>  

<p>A form of civil government in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> himself is recognized as the head. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the commonwealth are the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments of God</a>, and they are <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> and expounded by the accredited representatives of the invisible Deity, real or supposed&mdash;generally a <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Thus in a theocracy civic <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and functions form a part of religion, implying the absorption of the State by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or at least the supremacy of the latter over the State.

<p>The earliest recorded use of the term "theocracy" is found in <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, who apparently <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> it in explaining to <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> readers the organization of the Jewish commonwealth of his time. Contrasting this with other forms of government&mdash;monarchies, oligarchies, and republics&mdash;he adds: "Our legislator [<a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>] had no regard to any of these forms, but he <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> our government to be what by a strained expression, may be termed a theocracy [theokratian], by ascribing the power and authority to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and by persuading all the people to have a regard to him as the author of all good things" (Against Apion, book II, 16). In this connection <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> enters into a long and rather rambling discussion of the topic, but the entire passage is instructive.

<p>The extent to which the ideals of the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> theocracy were realized in the history of the Chosen People is a matter of controversy. Many eminent scholars are inclined to restrict its sway almost exclusively to the post-exilic period, when unquestionably the hierocratic rule and the ordinances of the Priestly Code were more fully carried into effect than in any of the preceding epochs. Be that as it may, and waiving critical discussion of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> writings with which the solution of the question is intimately connected, attention may be called to the fact that a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the theocratic rulership of nations and tribes is, in form more or less crude, characteristic of the common fund of <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. The various <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> were considered as having a territorial <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, fighting for their respective peoples and defending the lands in which they dwelled. This is amply <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the extant historic and religious records of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> and Babylonians, and the same <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> finds occasional expression in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> itself (see, for instance, <a href="../bible/jdg011.htm#vrs23">Judges 11:23 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/1sa026.htm#vrs19">1 Samuel 26:19</a>; <a href="../bible/rut001.htm#vrs15">Ruth 1:15-16</a>, etc.). In a passage of the <a href="../cathen/08547a.htm">Book of Judges</a>, Gideon is represented as refusing to accept the kingship offered to him by the people after his victory over the <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madianites</a>, in terms implying that the establishment of a permanent monarchy would involve disloyalty to the rule of <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a>. "I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you, but the Lord shall rule over you" (<a href="../bible/jdg008.htm#vrs23">Judges 8:23</a>). More explicit and stronger expression is given to the same view in the First Book of Kings in connection with the appeal of the people to the aged <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Samuel to constitute a king over them after the manner of the other nations. The request is displeasing to Samuel and to the Lord Himself, who commands the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> to accede to the wishes of the people that they may be punished for their rejection of His kingship. "And the Lord said to Samuel: Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say to thee. For they have not rejected thee, but me, that I should not reign over them" (<a href="../bible/1sa008.htm#vrs7">1 Samuel 8:7</a>). Again in chap. xii Samuel, in his final discourse to the people, reproaches them in similar words: "you said to me: Nay, but a king shall reign over us: whereas the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a> was your king". And at the call of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> the Lord sends thunder and rain as a sign of His displeasure, "and you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and see that you yourselves have done a great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the Lord, in desiring a king over you".

<p>The bearing of these passages on the historic institution of the theocracy varies in the estimation of different scholars according to the date assigned by them to the sources to which the passages belong. Wellhausen and his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, chiefly on a priori grounds, consider them a retouches of the post-exilic period, but it is far more probable that they form a part of a much older tradition, and indicate that a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the Lord's kingship over the Chosen People existed prior to the establishment of the earthly monarchy. At the same time, there is no sufficient warrant for assuming on the authority of these texts that the theocratic rule in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> came to an end with the inauguration of the monarchy, as is plain from the narration of the Lord's covenant with <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">King David</a> and his descendants (<a href="../bible/2sa007.htm#vrs1">2 Samuel 7:1-17</a>). According to the terms of this covenant the earthly monarch remains under the control of the heavenly King, and is constituted His vicegerent and representative. And this direct dependence of the king on the Lord for wisdom and guidance is assumed throughout the historical records of the Hebrew monarchy. The supreme test of the worthiness of any king to occupy his exalted position is his fidelity to the Lord and His revealed law. The historical books, and still more the writings of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, voice the constant <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> exercised a special and efficient rule over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> by <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>, punishments, and deliverances. In the post-exilic period the hierocratic rule became the dominant feature of the Jewish theocracy, and, in spite of its limitations and perversions, it prepared, according to the designs of a wise Providence, the way for the New Dispensation&mdash;the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of Heaven</a> so often mentioned in the Gospels.
