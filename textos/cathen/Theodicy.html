<h1>Theodicy</h1>  

<p>Etymologically considered theodicy (<em>theos dike</em>) signifies the justification of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The term was introduced into philosophy by <a href="../cathen/09134b.htm">Leibniz</a>, who, in 1710, published a work entitled: "Essais de Th&eacute;odic&eacute;e sur la bonte de Dieu, la libert&eacute; de l'homme et l'origine du mal". The purpose of the essay was to show that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the world does not conflict with the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that, indeed, notwithstanding its many evils, the world is the best of all possible worlds (see <a href="../cathen/11263a.htm">OPTIMISM</a>). The problem of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> (see <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">EVIL</a>) has from earliest times engrossed the attention of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. The well-known sceptic Pierre Bayle had denied in his "Dictionnaire historique et critique" the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence of God</a> on account of the sufferings experienced in this earthly life. The "Th&eacute;odic&eacute;e" of Leibniz was directed mainly against Bayle. Imitating the example of Leibniz other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> now called their treatises on the problem of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> "theodicies". As in a thorough treatment of the question the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> both of the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">attributes</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be disregarded, our entire <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was gradually brought within the domain of theodicy. Thus theodicy came to be synonymous with natural <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> (<em>theologia naturalis</em>) that is, the department of <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> which presents the positive <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> for the existence and <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">attributes of God</a> and solves the opposing difficulties. Theodicy, therefore, may be defined as the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> which treats of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the exercise of reason alone. It is a <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> because it systematically arranges the content of our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and demonstrates, in the strict sense of the word, each of its propositions. But it appeals to nature as its only source of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> sets forth our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as drawn from the sources of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> revelation.

<p>The first and most important task of theodicy is to prove the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>. It is of course presupposed that the suprasensible can be known and that the limits of experience pure and immediate can be transcended. The justification of this assumption must be furnished by other branches of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, e.g. criteriology and general <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>. The natural demonstrability of <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God's existence</a> was always accepted by the majority of theists. <a href="../cathen/05407a.htm#hume">Hume</a> and <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a> were the first to awaken in the minds of would-be theists serious <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> on this point. Not that these <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> presented any solid reason against the long-tested arguments for the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, but because in their systems a scientific <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the existence of a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> being is impossible. New ways of establishing theism were now sought. The Scotch School led by Thomas Reid taught that the fact of the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> is accepted by us without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of reasons but simply by a natural impulse. That <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God exists</a>, this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> said, is one of the chief metaphysical principles that we accept not because they are evident in themselves or because they can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, but because common sense obliges us to accept them. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the School of Jacobi taught that our reason is able to perceive the suprasensible. Jacobi distinguished three faculties: sense, reason, and understanding. Just as sense has immediate perception of the material so has reason immediate perception of the immaterial, while the understanding brings these perceptions to our consciousness and unites them to one another (St&ouml;ckl, "Geschichte der neueren Philosophie", II, 82 sqq.). <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God's existence</a>, then, cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>--Jacobi, like <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>, rejected the absolute value of the principle of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>--it must be felt by the mind. In his "Emile", Jean-Jacques Rousseau asserted that when our understanding ponders over the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> it encounters nothing but contradictions; the impulses of our hearts, however, are of more value than the understanding, and these proclaim clearly to us the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of natural religion, e.g., the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, etc. The same theory was advocated in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> by Friedrich Schleiermacher (d. 1834), who assumed an inner religious sense by means of which we feel religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>. According to Schleiermacher, religion consists solely in this inner perception, dogmatic doctrines are unessential (St&ouml;ckl, loc. cit., 199 sqq.). Nearly all <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> who have not yet sunken into <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheism</a> follow in Schleiermacher's footsteps. They generally teach that the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> cannot be demonstrated; <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> as to this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is only furnished us by inner experience, feeling, and perception.

<p>As is well known the <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernists</a> also deny the demonstrability of the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>. According to them we can only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> something of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by means of the vital immanence, that is, under favourable circumstances the need of the Divine dormant in our subconsciousness becomes conscious and arouses that religious feeling or experience in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> reveals himself to us (see <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">MODERNISM</a>). In condemnation of this view the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> against Modernism formulated by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> says: "Deum ... naturali rationis lumine per ea quae facta sunt, hoc est per visibilia creationis opera, tanquam causam per effectus certo cognosci adeoque demostrari etiam posse, profiteor", i.e., I declare that by the natural light of reason, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be certainly known and therefore His existence demonstrated through the things that are made, i.e., through the visible works of creation, as the cause is known through its effects.

<p>There is, however, still another class of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who assert that the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> present indeed a fairly large probability but no absolute <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>. A number of obscure points, they say, always remain. In order to overcome these difficulties there is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> either an act of the will, a religious experience, or the discernment of the misery of the world without <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that finally the heart makes the decision. This view is maintained, among others, by the noted English statesman Arthur Balfour in his widely read book "The Foundations of Belief" (1895). The opinions set forth in this work were adopted in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by <a href="../cathen/03010a.htm">Bruneti&eacute;re</a>, the editor of the "Revue des deux Mondes". Many <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> express themselves in the same manner, as, for instance, Dr. E. Dennert, President of the Kepler Society, in his work "Ist Gott tot?" (Stuttgart, 1908). It must undoubtedly be conceded that for the perception of religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> attitude and temper are of great importance. As the questions here under consideration are those that penetrate deeply into practical life and their solution is not directly evident, the will is thus able to hold fast to the opposing difficulties and to prevent the understanding from attaining to quiet, objective reflection. But it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> to say that the understanding cannot eliminate every reasonable <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, or that a subjective inclination of the heart is a guarantee of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, even though there is no evidence that it is based on objective facts. This latter view would open the door wide to religious extravagance. It is not, therefore, an excess of intellectualism to demand that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which serve as the rational basis of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shall be strictly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>.

<p>Even in earlier times there were those who denied that the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> could be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> absolutely by the understanding alone, and took refuge in Revelation. In his "Summa contra Gentiles" (I, c. xii) <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> refers to such reasoners. At a later date this opinion was championed by the <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalists</a>, <a href="../cathen/15636a.htm">William of Occam</a> and Gabriel Biel, as well as by the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>; the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> demanded the special aid of grace. In the nineteenth century the <a href="../cathen/15013a.htm">Traditionalists</a> (see <a href="../cathen/15013a.htm">TRADITIONALISM</a>) asserted that only when some vestiges of the original revelation reached man could he deduce with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>. <a href="../cathen/08703a.htm">Dr. J. Kuhn</a>, formerly professor at T&uuml;ubingen declares that the clear recognition of the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> requires a pure <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> unstained by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <a href="../cathen/11257a.htm">Ontologism</a> went to the other extreme and asserted the immediate cognition of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> offered an a priori <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>. This, however, has been always and rightly rejected by the majority of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, notwithstanding the modifications by which <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a>, <a href="../cathen/09134b.htm">Leibniz</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a> sought to save it (cf. Dr. Otto Paschen, "Der ontologische Gottesbeweis in der Scholastik", <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, 1903; M. Esser, "Der ontologische Gottesbeweis und seine Geschichte", Bonn, 1905). In regard to the various a posteriori <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, see the separate article. A dispute has arisen of late as to whether there are a number of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> or whether all are not merely parts of one and the same <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> (cf. Dr. C. Braig, "Gottesbeweis oder Gottesbeweise?", Stuttgart, 1889). It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that we always reach <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the cause, the last ground of all existence, and thus constantly follow as a guide the principle of sufficient reason. But the starting point of the individual <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> varies. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> calls them aptly (Summ. theol., I, Q. ii, a.3) <em>Vi&aelig;</em> i.e., roads to the apprehension of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which all open on the same highway.

<p>After demonstrating the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, theodicy investigates the question as to His nature and attributes. The latter are in part absolute (<em>quiescentia</em>) in part relative (<em>operativa</em>). In the first class belong the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, unity, immutability, omnipresence, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; to the second class the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, volition, and action of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The action of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> includes the creation, maintenance, and government of the world, the co-operation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with the activity of the creature, and the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. The understanding affords us abundant <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although it allows us faint glimpses of His essential greatness and beauty. For one thing should not be forgotten, namely, that all our cognition of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is incomplete and analogous, that is, is formed from notions that we have <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a> from created things. Hence it is that much remains obscure to us, as for instance, how <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> immutability harmonizes with His freedom, and how He knows the future. But the inadequacy of our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> does not justify the assertion of the <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnostic</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is unknowable and that consequently any attempt such as theodicy makes to reason about His attributes and our relations to Him is foredoomed to failure (see <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">AGNOSTICISM</a>).
