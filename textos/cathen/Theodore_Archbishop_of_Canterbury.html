<h1>Theodore, Archbishop of Canterbury</h1>  

<p>Seventh <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a> in Cilicia about 602; d. at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> 19 September, 690.

<p>Theodore was a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> (probably of the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian Order</a>) but not yet in <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a>, living at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 667, when <a href="../cathen/15484b.htm">Pope Vitalian</a> chose him for the <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">See of Canterbury</a> in place of Wighard, who had died before <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. After receiving <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">orders</a>, Theodore was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15484b.htm">Pope</a> himself, on 26 March, 668, and set out for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but did not reach <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> until May, 669. The new <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> found the <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">English Church</a> still suffering from the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">jealousies</a> and bitterness engendered by the long <a href="../cathen/05228a.htm">Paschal controversy</a>, only lately settled, and sadly lacking in order and organization. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, coterminous with the divisions of the various kingdoms, were of unwieldy size, and many of then were <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a>. Theodore, says <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, at once "visited all the island, wherever the tribes of the Angles inhabited", and was everywhere received with respect and welcome. He made appointments to the <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, regularized the position of <a href="../cathen/03470c.htm">St. Chad</a>, who had not been duly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, corrected all that was faulty, instituted the teaching of <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">music</a> and of sacred and secular <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">learning</a> throughout the country, and had the distinction of being, as <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> specifically mentions, "the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> whom all the <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>".

<p>In 673 he convoked at Hertford the first <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">province</a>, an assembly of great importance as the forerunner and prototype of future <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">English</a> witenagemotes and parliaments. Going later to the court of the King of Northumbria, which country was entirely under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a>, he divided it into four <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> against the will of Wilfrid, who <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appealed</a> to <a href="../cathen/01204c.htm">Pope Agatho</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> decision did not acquit Theodore of arbitrary and irregular action, although his plan for the subdivision of the Northumbrian <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was carried out. For <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a> in 685, and in the following year he was fully reconciled to Wilfrid, who was restored to his <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">See of York</a>. Thus, before his death, which occurred five years later, Theodore saw the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> system of the <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">English Church</a> fully organized under his <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatical</a> and <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitical</a> authority. Stubbs emphasizes the immensely important work done by Theodore not only in developing a single united ecclesiastical body out of the heterogeneous <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a> of the several <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">English</a> kingdoms, but in thus realizing a national unity which was not to be attained in secular matters for nearly three centuries.

<p>Apart from the epoch-making character of his twenty-one years' episcopate, Theodore was a man of commanding <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>: inclined to be autocratic, but possessed of great <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, remarkable powers of administration, and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of a high order, carefully cultivated. Practically his only literary remains are the collected decisions in <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">disciplinary</a> matters, well known as "The Penitential of Theodore". It was first published complete by Wasserschleben in 1851, and several editions of it have been printed during the past sixty years. Theodore was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in St. Augustine's Monastery, <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, a long poetical epitaph, of which <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> has preserved only eight verses, being inscribed upon his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>.
