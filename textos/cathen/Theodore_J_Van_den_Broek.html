<h1>Theodore J. Van den Broek</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Priest</a> and missionary, b. at <a href="../cathen/01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, 5 Nov., 1783; d. at Little Chute, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, 5 Nov., 1851. He made his studies in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in 1809, and was received into the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> in 1817. In 1819 he as appointed to Alkmaar, where he published "Sermons for all <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and Holidays". On 15 Aug., 1832, with seven other missionaries, he arrived in <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and thence went to Cincinnati. The missionaries were sent to different places, and Father Van den Broek eventually went to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Rose in <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>. After a short stay at St. Rose he was removed to Somerset, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. Hearing of the sad condition of the Indians in Michigan (now <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>), he obtained permission from <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">Bishop Purcell</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> to go to them, and arrived at <a href="../cathen/06777a.htm">Green Bay</a>, 4 July, 1834. He found there only ten <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, but laboured <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> among the whites and Indians. He completed the church and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> house begun by Father Mazzuchelli, and devoted himself to the Indians during an epidemic of cholera, aided by two self-sacrificing religious, Sisters Clara and Theresa Bourdalou. In 1836, at the request of the Indians of Little Chute, he took up his residence with them. He taught his Indian <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> the alphabet, and they could soon read <a href="../cathen/02282b.htm">Bishop Baraga's</a> <a href="../cathen/12350a.htm">prayer-books</a> and catechisms. The following year he built a log church thirty by twenty-two feet and in 1839 he built an addition thereto of twenty feet. As the mission at <a href="../cathen/06777a.htm">Green Bay</a> was for some time without a resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Father Van den Broek frequently said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> at each place, walking the intervening distance of twenty- two miles even in the severest weather. He made arduous and dangerous journeys of two hundred miles, to minister to his Menominee and Winnebago Indians.

<p>He had no income outside of his own resources; he built his first church himself, with the aid of his Indians. He was both <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and physician to the Indians at Buttes des Morts, Fort Winnebago, Fond du Lac, Prairie du Chien, Lake Poygan, Calumet, and even the Indian village on the Milwaukee River. He civilized the Indians, worked with them, showed them the use of tools, how to cultivate the land, and with their help he built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> seventy feet long, which he dedicated to St. John Nepomueene. Between 1836 and 1844 he converted and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> over eight hundred Indians. In 1847 having obtained a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to temporarily replace him, he sailed for <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, arriving at <a href="../cathen/01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a>, 13 August, 1847. In 1848 he returned with three shiploads of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> immigrants, whose descendants now form the population of north-eastern <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, and are distinguished by their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, industry, thrift, and good order. The influence of their missionary work has extended into <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>, <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>, <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, <a href="../cathen/10729b.htm">Nebraska</a>, <a href="../cathen/14160a.htm">South Dakota</a>, Noth <a href="../cathen/14017a.htm">Dakota</a>, <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, and other states.
