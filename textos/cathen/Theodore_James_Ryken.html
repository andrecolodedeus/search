<h1>Theodore James Ryken</h1>  

<p>Known as B<font size=-2>ROTHER</font> F<font size=-2>RANCIS</font> X<font size=-2>AVIER</font>, founder of the <a href="../cathen/15728b.htm">Xaverian Brothers</a>. Born at Elshout, North Brabant, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, 30 August, 1797, died at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, 1871. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, who were devout <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, died while he was yet a child, and a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> uncle reared him. Even in youth he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and at nineteen he became a catechist. At twenty-five he became secretary to a well-known convert, M. Le Sage-ten-Broek, and acted in that capacity for four years, until cholera broke out at Groningen. While helping to nurse the patients, he caught the infection, and came near to death. In 1826 he made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> gave him a medal in commemoration. He made a second visit in 1838, and had an audience with <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>. In 1827 he entered a <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappist</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> but, as his confessor told him that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had other designs for him, his stay was short. Ryken came to America in 1831, and remained for three years. His observations in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> convinced him that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers were needed, and, returning to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, he planned to establish a teaching institute. In 1837 he returned to America and obtained written approval from seven <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Thereupon he asked permission from Bishop Boussen, of <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, to found a congregation. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> consented, but, before the actual foundation, required Ryken to pass a year's <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, which he fulfilled with the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15728b.htm">Xaverian Brothers</a> were established at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> in 1839 The beginning was hard, the founder having, with two or three companions, to struggle against disheartening obstacles. Courage and energy prevailed, and after a few years came brighter days. Brother Francis pronounced the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of religion in 1846. In 1860, after holding the office of <a href="../cathen/14336a.htm">Superior</a> General of the Xaverians for twenty-seven years, he was relieved of his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> on account of failing strength. At the time of his death the Xaverians were firmly settled in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. In Ryken's character the conspicuous traits were optimistic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, rigor towards self, and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the observance of the rule.
