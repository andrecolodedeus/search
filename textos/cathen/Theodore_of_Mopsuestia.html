<h1>Theodore of Mopsuestia</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10555a.htm">Mopsuestia</a> in Cilicia and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer; b. at Antioch about 350 (thus also known as Theodore of Antioch), of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> and prominent <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; d. 428.
<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>According to Syrian sources Theodore was the cousin of the somewhat younger Nestorius (Nestle, op. cit. in bibliography); Polychromius, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01592b.htm">Apamea</a>, was a brother of Theodore. The clever and highly gifted youth received the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in classical literature usual to his station and studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and rhetoric in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the renowned <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> rhetorician Libanius. He here became acquainted with his early friends, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> and Maximus, later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a> (perhaps as fellow-student). Following the example of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (<a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, <a href="../fathers/26016.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.3</a>), Theodore renounced a secular career when about eighteen years old, and devoted himself to the ascetic life in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Diodorus (later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>) and Carterius, situated near Antiochia. His youthful and too tempestuous <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> soon grew cold, and, owing chiefly to the memory of Hermione whom he intended to take as wife, he resolved to return to the world (<a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, <a href="../fathers/26028.htm"><em>Church History</em> VIII.2</a>; Hesychius Hieros., "Hist. eccl." in <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, "Concil.", IX, 248). <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom's</a> grief at this step of his friend was so great that he addressed him two letters or treatises ("Ad Theodorum lapsum" in P.G., XLVII, 277 sqq.) to recall him to his early resolution. A little later Theodore did indeed return to the "divine philosophy" of the ascetic monastic life. He quickly acquired a great acquaintance with the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. Impetuous and restless of character, he had already, when scarcely twenty years old (at eighteen according to Leontius, "Adv. Incorrupticolas", viii, in P.G., LXXXVI, 1364), applied himself to <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> compositions. His first work was the commentary on the Psalms, in which his extreme <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> tendencies in the sense of an almost exclusively grammatico-historical and realistic explanation of the text is already manifest (see below Theodore's Hermeneutics). Between 383 and 386 he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (perhaps together with <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>) by his early teacher (now <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>) <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a>. Theodore soon displayed a very keen interest in the theologico-polemical discussions of the time, writing and preaching against the <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenists</a>, <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, <a href="../cathen/05605a.htm">Eunomians</a>, <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarists</a>, magicians, <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a>, etc. His keen and versatile literary activity won him the name of "Polyhistor" (<a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, op. cit., VIII, ii). Theodore apparently left Antioch before 392 to join his old teacher Diodorus, who was then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a> (Hesychius Hier., op. cit., in <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, IX, 248). Probably through the influence of Diodorus he was named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10555a.htm">Mopsuestia</a> in 392, in which capacity he was to labour thirty-six years. In 394 he attended the Synod of Constantinople, and during its progress preached before the <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius the Great</a>. During the confusion concerning <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, Theodore remained faithful to his early friend (cf. <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, "Epp.", cxii, in P.G., LII, 668; Latin translation in Facundus, loc. cit., VII, 7). Later (about 421) he received hospitably <a href="../cathen/08557b.htm">Julian of Eclanum</a> and other <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, and doubtless allowed himself to be further influenced by their dogmatic <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. However, he later associated himself with the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> at a synod in Cilicia (Marius Merc. in P.L., XLVIII, 1044). He died in 428, the year in which Nestorius succeeded to the episcopal See of Constantinople. During his lifetime Theodore was always regarded as <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> and as a prominent <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> author, and was even consulted by distant <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> on <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> questions.
<h2 id="section2">Writings</h2>

<p>The most complete list of the writings of Theodore is given by Ebedjesu (d. 1318; see Assemani, "Bibl. orient.", III, 30-36). According to this the following works existed in a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> translation.

<p><em>A. Exegetical Commentaries</em>

<p>(a) On the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>: (1) on Genesis, 3 books (Greek fragments in the Nicephoruscatene, Leipzig 1772; Syrian in Sachau, 1-21); (2) on the Psalms, 5 books (Greek fragments in P.G., LXVI, 648; Latin translation discovered by Mercati, see bibliography; Greek text discovered by Lietzmann, but not yet edited, cf. ibid.); (3) on the twelve Minor <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">Prophets</a> (extant in its entirety; edited by <a href="../cathen/09538a.htm">Mai</a> in PG LXVI, 124-632); (4) on the First and Second Books of Kings, 1 book (lost); (5) on Job, 2 books, dedicated to <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a> (only four fragments preserved in P.G., loc. cit., 697 sq.); (6) on Ecclesiastes, 1 book (lost); (7) to the four Great Prophets, 4 books (lost). Assemani adds "Qu&aelig;stiones et Responsiones in Sacram Scripturam"; the fragments mentioned by the Fifth &OElig;cumenical Council (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, IX, 225) on the Canticle of Canticles are perhaps taken from a letter.

<p>(b) On the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>: (1) on Matthew, I book (fragments in P.G., LXVI, 705 sqq.); (2) on Luke, 1 book (fragments, ibid., 716 sqq.); (3) on John, 1 book (fragments, ibid., 728; Syrian, discovered and edited by Chabot, Paris, 1897); (4) on the Acts, 1 book (fragments in P.G., LXVI, 785 sq.); (5) on all the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (Greek fragments in P.G., LXVI, 188-968) the Epistles to the Galatians, Colossians, Thessalonians, Philemon, Latin edition by H. B. Swete, Cambridge, 1880-82).



<p><em>B. Opascula</em>

<p>(1) "De sacramentis", 1 book (lost); (2) "De fide", 1 book ("Liber ad baptizatos", according to Facundus, op. cit., LX, 3; fragments in Swete, II, 323-27); (3) "De sacerdotio", 1 book (lost); (4) "De Spiritu Sancto", 2 books, against the Macedonians (lost); (5) "De Incarnatione", 15 books (cf. Facundus, IX, 3; Gennadius, 12; written at Antioch about 382-92 against the <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarians</a> and <a href="../cathen/05605a.htm">Eunomians</a>; Greek fragm. in P.G., LXVI, 969 sqq., and Swete, II, 290-312); (6) "Contra Eunomium", 2 books (one fragment in Facundus, IX, 3; (7) "Contra dicentes: peccatum naturae inesse" 2 books (cf. Photius, "Bibl.", 177); (8) "Contra magicam artem", 2 books (cf. Photius, 81); (9) "Ad monachos", 1 book (lost); (10) "De obscura locutione" 1 book (lost); (11) "De perfectione operum", 1 book (lost); (12) "Contra allegoristas", 5 books (cf. Facundus, III, 6: "De allegoria et historia"); (13) "De Assumente et Assumpto", 1 book (lost); (14) "De legislatione", 1 book (lost). Many unidentified fragments are perhaps taken from lost works. The fifteen hooks "De mysteriis" or "Opus mysticum", mentioned by Assemani (III, 1, 563), are probably identical with the "Codex mysticus" cited by Facundus (III, 2). Concerning the "Symbolum fidei" (Facundus, III, 2; Leontius, P.G., LXXXVI, 1367), cf. Fritzsche in P.G., LXVI, 73 sqq. Leontius Byzant. ("Advers. Incorr.", xx, in P.G., LXXXVI, 1368) says, perhaps with reference to the so-called <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Liturgy, that Theodore had also introduced a new Liturgy.

<p><em>C. Letters</em>

<p>These were collected in one volume which is now lost.
<h2 id="section3">Theodore's doctrine</h2>

<p><em>A. Hermeneutics and Canon</em>

<p>As regards the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, Theodore seems to have accepted <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Flavius Josephus's</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of inspiration and his canon. He rejected as uncanonical the Book of Job, the Canticle of Canticles, the Book of Esdras, and the deutero-canonical books. From the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> he excised the <a href="../cathen/03453a.htm">Catholic Epistles</a> (except I Peter and I John) and the Apocalypse (cf. Leontius, loc. cit., III, 13-17, in P.G., LXXXVI, 1365-68). In his explanation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> Theodore employs primarily the prevailing historical and grammatical method of the Antiochene <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Of all the Psalms he recognized only ii, vii, xiv, and cx as containing direct prophetic reference to the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>; the Canticle of Canticles was pronounced by him a vulgar nuptial poem.

<p><em>B. Anthropology and Doctrine of Justification</em>

<p>Theodore's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning justification gave rise to very grave misgivings, even if we reject the accusations of Leontius (loc. cit., 20-37) as exaggerated. According to Theodore, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of Adam rendered himself and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> subject to death, because he was then mutable. But that which was the consequence of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the case of Adam is in his descendants its cause, so that in consequence of mutability all men in some manner or other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> personally. The object of the Redemption was to transfer <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> from this condition of mutability and mortality to the state of immutability and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. This happened first in the case of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, fundamentally by the union with the Logos, to a greater extent at His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and completely at His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. In <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> this change is effected by union with Christ. The union begins in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, through which (1) all (personal) <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted, (2) the grace of Christ is granted, which leads us to immutability (sinlessness) and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. At the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of children only this second effect occurs. That these <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> show a certain resemblance to the fundamental thoughts of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> is not to be denied; whether, however, Theodore influenced <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> and Caelestius (according to Marius Mercator, through the medium of the Syrian Rufinus; P.L., XLVIII, 110), or whether these influenced Theodore, is very difficult to determine.

<p><em>C. Christology</em>

<p>Theodore's <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christology</a> exercised a more direct and eventful influence on the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of his (mediate) disciple Nestorius. The contemporary polemics against <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> and <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarianism</a> led the Antiochenes (Diodorus, Theodore, and Nestorius) to emphasize energetically the perfect Divinity and the unimpaired Humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and to separate as sharply as possible the two natures. Thus, in a sermon which he delivered at Antioch (perhaps the first as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>), Theodore vehemently attacked the use of the term <em>theotokos</em>, long employed in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> terminology, because Mary was strictly speaking <em>anthropotokos</em>, and only indirectly <em>theotokos</em>. It was only by recalling his words and correcting himself that Theodore could appease the excitement resulting from this view (see <a href="../cathen/08468a.htm">John of Antioch</a>, "Epist. ad Theodosium imper." in Facundus Herm., "Pro defensione trium capp.", X, 2; P.L., LXXXVII, 771). It cannot indeed be denied that the Antiochene separation of the natures must result in an improper weakening of the union in Christ. Like Nestorius, Theodore expressly declares that he wished to uphold the unity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in Christ; perhaps they recognized some distinction between nature and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> exactly what was the distinguishing factor, and therefore used faulty paraphrases and comparisons, and spoke of the two natures in a way which, taken strictly, presupposed two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Thus, according to Theodore, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Christ was not only <em>passibilis</em>, but also really <em>tentabilis</em>, since otherwise His actual freedom from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would be the result of His physical union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not a merit of His free wilt. The union of the human and Divine nature happens not <em>kat ousian</em> nor <em>kat energeian</em>, but <em>kat eudokian</em> (at will), and indeed a <em>eudokia hos en houio</em>, which effects a <em>enosis eis en prosopon</em>. The two natures form a unity, "like man and wife" or "body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>". Consequently, according to Theodore, the <em>communicato idiomatum</em>, fundamentally speaking, is also lawful.
<h2 id="section4">The condemnation of the doctrine of Theodore</h2>

<p>While during his lifetime (apart from the episode at Antioch) Theodore was regarded as <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> (cf. Theodoret, <a href="../fathers/27025.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.39</a>; <a href="../cathen/08468a.htm">John of Antioch</a>, in Facundus, II, 2), a loud outcry was raised against him when the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> appealed to his writings. The first to represent him as the father of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> was Marius Mercator in his work "Liber subnotationum in verba Juliani, Praef." (about 431; in P.L., XLVIII, 111). He was accused of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> by <a href="../cathen/07303b.htm">Hesychius of Jerusalem</a> in his Church History (about 435) Rabulas of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> went so far as to pronounce <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> on Theodore. Acting under the influence of the latter, <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a> expressed himself in fairly sharp terms concerning Theodore, naming him with Diodorus the "patres Nestorii blasphem&aelig;e" ("Ep. lxxi ad Theodosium imp.", in P.G. LXXVII, 341-44); he was, however, unwilling to condemn Theodore, as he had died in peace with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> strife passed by without any official action being taken by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against Theodore, although his writings stood in higher favour among the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> and Nisibis than those of Nestorius himself. The General <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> seemed rather to favour Theodore, when it declared his disciples and admirers, Theodoret and Ibas of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, although the latter in his epistle to Maris had referred to Theodore in terms of the highest praise. The Monophysitic reaction against the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> in the sixth century first succeeded in bringing Theodore's <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and writings under the ban of the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">ecclesiastical anathema</a> through the ill-famed dispute of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>. Theodore was for the first time condemned as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> by the Emperor Justinian in his edict against the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a> (544). Under the influence of imperial pressure <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Pope Vigilius</a> composed (553) at Constantinople a document in which sixty propositions taken from Theodore's writing were declared <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>. Finally, at the Fifth General Synod (553), at which, however, Vigilius did not participate, the three Chapters, including Theodore's writings and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, were placed under <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. It was only on 8 December that Vigilius, broken with exile, gave his approval to the decrees of the synod. Among the most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> defenders of Theodore and the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>, besides <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Pope Vigilius</a> (until 533), were the African Facundus of Hermiana ("Pro defensione trium capitulorum libri XII", in P.L., LXVII, 527 sqq.) and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/11586a.htm">Paulinus of Aquileia</a> and Vitalis of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>.
