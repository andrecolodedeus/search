<h1>Theodorich Canisius</h1>  

<p>Born at Nimwegen, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, 1532; died 27 September, 1606, at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>. He was a half-brother on his mother's side to St. Peter Canisius. After winning, at the age of twenty-two, the highest academic distinction at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, he decided to follow his stepbrother and enter the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, and was sent to St. Ignatius in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, who received him into the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. On the completion of his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, Theodorich was appointed professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, but was soon after appointed <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the Jesuit <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>. Here, in 1562, one of the first productions in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a> play "Homulus" (Everyman) was given in Latin by the students under his direction. From <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, where he was succeeded in 1565 by the celebrated Paul Hoffaeus, he was transferred to <a href="../cathen/04795a.htm">Dillingen</a>, where for twenty years he presided over the college and the academy and laboured with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and success for the improvement of studies and for the religious training of the students. From 1565 to 1582 he held the office of chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. In company with his distinguished brother, he attended the first provincial congregation of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in Upper Germany, and furthered important reforms in the teaching of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. In 1585 he was made <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Ingolstadt, and in this capacity became a member of the German commission which tested in practice the first draft of the <a href="../cathen/12654a.htm">Ratio Studiorum</a>. At length, having spent thirty years at the head of three of the foremost colleges of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, he was sent to Lucerne in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> to enjoy a period of rest; but soon again, at the age of sixty-three, he had to undertake the government of the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Ingolstadt. Two years later, on the advice of his physician, he was relieved of the burden and allowed to return to Lucerne. A fortnight after his arrival the death of St. Peter Canisius was announced. The shock deprived Theodorich of <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> and speech, an affliction which he bore with exemplary patience for seven years. For his amiable disposition and spotless purity of life he deservedly received the surname of Angelus. In 1604, he was transferred again to Ingolstadt, where he died, and was laid to rest in the church of the Holy Cross.
