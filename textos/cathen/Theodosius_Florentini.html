<h1>Theodosius Florentini</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, in the Grisons, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, 23 May, 1808; died at Heiden, in Appenzell, 15 Feb., 1865. He entered the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin Franciscan Order</a>, 22 Oct., 1825, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1830, and appointed <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> master, and lecturer on <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. In 1838 he became guardian at <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a>; in 1845 superior and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/03743b.htm">Chur</a>; in 1857 definitor, and in 1860 <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03743b.htm">Diocese of Chur</a>. In the first half of the nineteenth century the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> found themselves in a lamentable position. In addition to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> ascendency there was the spirit of unbelief and of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>. Even the Governments of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cantons lent themselves to the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the conventual houses. The unfortunate Sonderbund <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> had broken the power and confidence of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and the victorious Radical party forced upon the country a constitutional league pledged to the destruction of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests. In consequence of his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> defence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, Father Theodosius was forced to fly to Alsace in 1841. But in August of the same year he returned, and brought his experience to bear on plans for the welfare of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and people. First he founded the Institute of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> church at Altorf on 16 Oct., 1844, the first three sisters received the habit of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis. Their constitutions enjoin upon them to make themselves all to all in order to win <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and to do nothing which might repel any from their mode of life. From this foundation grew the congregation of teaching sisters, with their mother-house at Memingen, which has now about 1200 members. Later on Father Theodosius founded the congregation of <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> at Ingenbohl, which numbers 5251 sisters in 878 institutions. These congregations have been approved by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Both are actively engaged in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> works; they have foundling asylums, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, kindergartens, poor <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, boarding-schools for girls, and <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> for teachers. Both have in their homes for girls a <em>patronage</em>, as the French call it, for servant girls, factory workers, shop assistants, and others. The <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> have, besides, homes for the poor and sick, and undertake private nursing.

<p>In the meantime Father Theodosius was himself busy as a schoolmaster. He superintended the people's <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (<em>Volkssch&uuml;len</em>), which are attended by others besides the poor. He promoted continuation <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and was in favour of technical instruction for apprentices and workmen. He founded anew the suppressed <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a>, Maria-Hilf zu Schwyz, where there are now more than 400 pupils. It comprises a gymnasium, lyceum, and an industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> with technical and mercantile departments. To stir up anew <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life he engaged in popular missions and retreats for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. To provide for the needs of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> parts of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> he founded the home missions for which he provided a special fund. The institution of the annual conference of the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was largely due to his efforts. To bring <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> together to strengthen <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> feeling, and to organize social works, he founded the Pius Society. For this <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> Father Theodosius worked harder than for all else; it was in connexion with this that he more fully expounded his <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> social <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. He was very keen upon the care and inspection of the helpless and dependent, such as boarded-out children, apprentices, neglected children, and discharged <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>. With regard to the labour question Father Theodosius expressed himself very fully in his speech at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> in 1863. In demanding the Christianizing of industry, trade unions, and workmen's credit banks, he said: "Formerly <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were turned into factories, now factories must become <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and the profits must be shared with the workers". Factories were established to carry out this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, but they failed, owing to a lack of business capacity in the founders. At Ingenbohl Father Theodosius founded a printing and book-binding establishment and a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> for the distribution of good books. Among his own writings are the "Legends of the Saints" in four volumes. His spirit was well expressed in the saying of St. Augustine which on the eve of his death he wrote in the notebook of a teacher: "In necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus charitas". A favourite maxim of his was: "Whatever is the need of the time, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Will".
