<h1>Theodosius I</h1>  

<p>Roman Emperor (also known as Flavius Theodosius), born in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, about 346; died at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 17 January, 395. Theodosius is one of the sovereigns by universal consent called Great. He stamped out the last vestiges of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>, put an end to the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian heresy</a> in the empire, pacified the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>, left a famous example of penitence for a crime, and reigned as a just and mighty <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> emperor. His father, the Comes Theodosius, was a distinguished general; both he and the mother Thermantia were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> at a time when <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> was at its strongest. Theodosius the son distinguished himself in the army, was made Dux of Moesia, defeated the Sarmatians (Ammianus Marcellinus, XXIX, 6); then, when an intrigue brought about the disgrace and execution of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> (376) he retired to his own <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. But his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> was not forgotten. The Emperor Gratian (375-383) after the death of <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> (378) took Theodosius from private life and made him his fellow-emperor (Augustus) for the East (19 Jan., 379). He was already married to Aelia Flacilla, by whom he had two sons, Arcadius and Honorius (his future successors) and a daughter Pulcheria. As Augustus he carried on the Gothic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> vigorously and successfully. During the year 380 he was able to conclude a victorious peace with the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>; on 24 November he held his triumph at Constantinople. Meanwhile he had also repressed the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> and Huns. Early in the same year a severe sickness at <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a> made him seek <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, Ascholios. <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> (<a href="../fathers/26015.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.6</a>) says that since Theodosius "was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> from his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and professed the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">Homoousios</a>" he first assured himself that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was not an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>; <a href="../fathers/26027.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.4</a>). A great part of the emperor's activity was now spent in establishing the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and repressing <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>. In February, 380, he and Gratian published the famous edict that all their subjects should profess the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Alexandria (Cod. Theod., XVI, I, 2; <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, VII, 4). The conventicles of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> were not to be called churches.

<p>As soon as he came to Constantinople Theodosius began expelling the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, who had hitherto been in possession. The Aryan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Demophilus, left the city (Socr., V, 7; Soz., VII, 5), <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a> undertook the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In January, 381, the prefect had orders to close all <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> in the city and to expel those who served them. The same severe measures were ordered throughout Theodosius's dominion, not only against <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, but also in the case of <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> and all other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. However <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> says that the emperor "made severe punishment by his <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> but did not carry them out, for he did not wish to punish, but only to frighten his subjects, that they might think as he did about Divine things, And he praised those who were converted of their own accord" (<a href="../fathers/26027.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.12</a>). In 381 the Second General Council was held at Constantinople under his auspices (Socrates, <a href="../fathers/26015.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.8</a>; <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, <a href="../fathers/26027.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.7</a>). In 383 he attempted a conference at his capital between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, with a view to reconciliation; but no result was obtained (Socr., V, 10; <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, <a href="../fathers/26027.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.12</a>). In the same year Gratian was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> (25 Aug.) and Clemens Maximus usurped the imperial title in the West (383-388). Theodosius acknowledged the usurper on condition that he would allow Gratian's brother, <a href="../cathen/15255a.htm">Valentinian II</a>, to reign in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In 387 Maximus broke the contract and expelled Valentinian, who fled to Theodosius. Theodosius brought him back with an army, and defeated and executed Maximus at <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>. <a href="../cathen/15255a.htm">Valentinian II</a> now reigned in the West until 392. It was also in 387 that Theodosius showed such tolerance in the affair of the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> at Antioch (see <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">JOHN CHRYSOSTOM</a>).

<p>During all his reign Theodosius took severe measures against the surviving remnants of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>. In 388 a prefect was sent around <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> for the purpose of destroying <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> and breaking up <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> associations; it was then that the Serapeum at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> was destroyed (Socr., V, 16). Libanius wrote a "Lamentation" about the destruction of the fanes of the gods (<em>peri ton leron</em>, ed. R. Foerster, Bibl. Script. Gr. et Rom. Teubner). In 391 Theodosius refused to allow the Altar of Victory to be restored in the Roman Senate (cf. Gibbon, "Decline and Fall", xxviii). <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, omens, and <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witchcraft</a> were to be punished as loesa majestas (Cod. Theod., XVI, X, 10-12). In short his <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> put an end finally to the old cult, at any rate as far as open and public use is concerned. One of its last acts was a despairing appeal to the sword, which offers again the dramatic situation of a field of battle on which the religion of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> seemed to depend. Argobast, the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> tutor of <a href="../cathen/15255a.htm">Valentinian II</a>, at least indirectly caused his ward's death (Hodgkin, "Italy and Her Invaders", I, 590) and set up a rhetorician, Eugenius, in his stead (15 May, 392). Theodosius hastened to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to avenge this crime. Eugenius, although nominally a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, tried to unite the remains of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> in his defence. He set up <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> altars again (including that of Victory at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>), his soldiers marched under the standard of Hercules invictus. But near Aquileia on 6 Sept., 394, once more the <a href="../cathen/08717c.htm">Christian Labarum</a> triumphed over the banner of the ancient gods; Theodosius entered <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> sole master of the now finally <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> empire. Further <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> enforced the keeping of Sunday and the disabilities of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. During the greater part of his reign Theodosius was in intimate relation with <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>. The story of the emperor's worst crime, the massacre of at least 7000 citizens of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a> in revenge for a tumult (April, 390); of St. Ambrose's refusal to allow him to enter the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; of his acceptance of eight months of penance, is one of the memorable incidents of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">Church history</a>.

<p>Theodosius married Galla (daughter of Valentinian I) after the death of his first wife, and by her had a daughter, Galla Placidia, the mother of <a href="../cathen/15255b.htm">Valentinian III</a>. St. Ambrose preached his funeral oration ("De obitu Theodosii", P.L., XVI, 1385). His two sons Arcadius and Honorius had already been proclaimed Augustus during his life. Arcadius became emperor of the eastern half of the empire, Honorius of the western. The Roman world was never again united. Theodosius stands out as the destroyer of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>, as the last sovereign of the undivided empire. A coin representing him holding the <a href="../cathen/08717c.htm">Labarum</a> with the inscription, <em>Restitutor Reipublicae</em>, expresses perfectly his title to remembrance.
