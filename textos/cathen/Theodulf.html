<h1>Theodulf</h1>  

<p>(Theodulfus, Theodulfe), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, a writer skilled in poetic forms and a learned <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, born in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> about 760; died at <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 18 December, 821. By descent a Goth, he became before 794 a member of the court of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, where he was, next to <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, the most distinguished and learned <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> granted him (about 798) the Bishopric of Orl&eacute;ans; and several <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>. He laboured successfully in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> as a reformer both of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people, as is shown by his two Capitularies, one of which has forty-six chapters; he also encouraged <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. In 798 he was sent, with <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Leidrad of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, as a royal messenger (<em>missus dominicus</em>) to the southern part of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In his poem, "Versus contra judices", in which he complains of the severity of <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and addresses earnest warnings to the judges. He gives an account of his experiences while on this mission. As a writer on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> he took part in the dispute over the term <em>Filioque</em> (the procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> from the Son as well as from the Father) and defended this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> at the request of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> in the treatise, "De spiritu sancto". He also wrote at the wish of the emperor, "De ordine baptismi", a description of the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> at <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. He is further, apparently, the author of an exposition of the Holy Mass and of the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a>. As regards language and metre he occupies the first place among the poets of the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> era and distinguished himself by spirit and skill; particularly interesting are the letters which he wrote in the form of poems giving an animated picture of the life at court. His <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> for <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a>, <a href="../cathen/16041b.htm">"Gloria, laus, et honor"</a> (Analecta hymnica, L, 160 sq.), came into <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> use. He is also known as a patron and lover of art. He was still in favour at the beginning of the reign of Louis the Pious, but later, being accused of sharing in the conspiracy of King Bernard of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, was consequently <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> in 818 and exiled to Angers.
