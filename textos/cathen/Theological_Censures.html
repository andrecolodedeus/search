<h1>Theological Censures</h1>  

<p>Doctrinal judgments by which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> stigmatizes certain teachings detrimental to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. They should not be confounded with canonical censures, such as <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, suspension, and <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>, which are spiritual punishments inflicted on delinquents.

<p>The right of censuring adverse doctrines has ever been asserted by the church, from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, who declares <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> on them who should pervert the Gospel of Christ unto another Gospel (<a href="../bible/gal001.htm#vrs8">Galatians 1:8</a>), and warns his disciples to avoid the profane novelties of words and the oppositions of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> falsely so called (<a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#vrs20">1 Timothy 6:20</a>), down to <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, who condemned the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">"Modernism"</a>. It is an essential part of her magisterium which, says <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, "acts in two channels, in direct statement of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and in condemnation of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>." See the letter "Gravissimas inter" of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> and the constitution "de fide" (ch. iv) of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, nos. 1524 and 1645). That right belongs to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself, but she may exercise it through <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, councils, <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman congregations</a>, <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, or special commissions. Bishops, by virtue of their office, hold the power of censuring doctrines, but their judgment is not final, and their prohibition binds only within the limits of their respective <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Private <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, either individually or collectively have no authority officially to censure propositions, however they may, unless expressly enjoined from so doing in special cases, judge and qualify them according to existing <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> standards, and their initiative often goes far towards preparing the official action of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. History shows considerable variation in the exercise of the censuring power. In early days, when the cardinal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> were at stake, an author, book, or tract was purely and simply announced <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle ages</a>, which were the ages of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> speculation and also of subtlety, a more minute notation had to be resorted to, and even special organs were created for that purpose (see Index of Prohibited Books). In recent times specific notes are often discarded in favor of a more comprehensive mode of censuring; <em>damnandas et proscribendas esse</em>. The various documents embodied in nearly all modern textbooks of <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> and in <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger's</a> "Enchiridion" (to which we must now add the Holy Office <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a>, 3 July, "Lamentabili sane exitu" and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a>, 8 Sept., 1907, "Pascendi dominici gregis") shows a large number of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> censures or notes. Those most in use will be found in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a> and "Auctorem fidei" (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, CI and CXIV). We may divide them into three groups according as they bear principally upon (1) the import, or (2) the expression, or (3) the consequences, of condemned propositions.

<p>(1) <em>H&aelig;retica</em> (<a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>), <em>erronea</em> (<a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>), <em>h&aelig;resi proxima</em> (next to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>), <em>errori proxima</em> (next to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>), <em>temeratia</em> (rash), etc.

<p>A proposition is branded <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> when it goes directly and immediately against a revealed or defined <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, or <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> <em>de fide</em>; <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> when it contradicts only a certain (<em>certa</em>) <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> conclusion or <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> clearly <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a> from two premises, one an <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a>, the other naturally certain. Even though a statement be not obviously a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> it may yet come near to either. It is styled next, proximate to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> when its opposition to a revealed and defined <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> is not certain, or chiefly when the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> it contradicts, though commonly accepted as revealed, has yet never been the object of a definition (<em>proxima fidei</em>). The censure next, or proximate to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, whose meaning may be determined by analogy to the foregoing, is of less frequent use than that of rashness or temerity, which means opposition to sound common opinion (<em>communis</em>), and this either for paltry reasons or no reasons at all. A still finer shade of meaning attaches to such censures as <em>sapiens h&aelig;resim, errorem</em> (smacking of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>), <em>suspecta de h&aelig;resi, errore</em> (suspected of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>). Propositions thus noted may be correct in themselves, but owing to various circumstances of time, place, and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, are prudently taken to present a signification which is either <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> or <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>. To this group also belong some special stigmata with reference to determined topics, e.g. the preambles of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (<em>infidelis, aversiva a fide</em>), <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> principles (<em>improbabilis, non tuta</em>), history (<em>antiquata, nova</em>) and <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> (<em>verbo Dei contraria</em>), etc.

<p>(2) <em>Ambigua</em> (ambiguous), <em>captiosa</em> (captious), <em>male sonans</em> (evil-sounding), <em>piarum aurium offensiva</em> (offensive to pious ears), etc.

<p>A proposition is ambiguous when it is worded so as to present two or more senses, one of which is objectionable; captious when acceptable words are made to express objectionable thoughts; evil-sounding when improper words are used to express otherwise acceptable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>; offensive when verbal expression is such as rightly to shock the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sense and delicacy of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>(3) <em>Subsannativa religionis</em> (derisive of religion), <em>decolorativa canodris ecclesi&aelig;</em> (defacing the beauty of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>), <em>subversiva hierarchi&aelig;</em> (subversive of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>), <em>eversiva regnorum</em> (destructive of governments), <em>scandelosa, perniciosa, periculosa in moribus</em> (<a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a>, pernicious, dangerous to <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>), <em>blasphema, idolatra, superstisiosa, magica</em> (blasphemous, leading to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">sorcery</a>), <em>arrogans, acerba</em> (arrogant, harsh), etc.

<p>This enumeration, though incomplete, sufficiently draws the aim of the third group of censures; they are directed against such propositions as would imperil religion in general, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, unity of government and <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, civil <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> in general, or the virtue of religion, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> meekness, and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> in particular.

<p>The authority of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> censures depends upon the source from which they come and the intention with which they are issued. Condemnations coming from the seat of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a>, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> or council, and vested with the usual conditions of an ex cathedra pronouncement are themselves <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a>, and consequently require both our external obedience and internal assent. There is no reason for restricting the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> of the censures to the sole note heretica as some <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> would do. The difference between the note of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and other inferior notes is not one of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a>, but of different matters covered by <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a>. The note of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> attached to a proposition makes it contradictory to an <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a>, which is not the case with other notes, even if they are <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a>. Condemnations coming from another source which, however, is not <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> are to be received with the external respect and implicit obedience due to disciplinary measures, and moreover, with that degree of internal assent which is justified by circumstances. In every case the extent of outward compliance, or of interior submission, or both is determined by a proper interpretation of the censures: <ul> <li>Sometimes, as in the condemned propositions of Pistoia, there is little room for <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, the precise meaning of the condemnation being explained in the very tenor of it. <li>When categorical propositions are condemned in their import, and not in their wording or consequences only, their contradictories present themselves for our acceptance as <em>de fide, proxim&aelig; fidei, cert&aelig;,</em> or <em>communes</em> as the case may be. <li>Condemnations issued on account of bad wording or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> consequences should at least put us on our guard against the hidden falsehood or the noxious tendency of the proposition. <li>Modal propositions require special attention. The principal modalities in use are <em>in individuo, in globo, prout iacent, in sensu ab auctore intenta</em>. Propositions are not always, as was the case for the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Pistoia, condemned one by one, the proper qualifications being attached to each individually (<em>in individuo</em>). In the case of <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a>, <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">Hus</a>, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a>, Molinos, <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a>, etc., to a whole series of propositions a whole series of censures was attached generally (<em>in globo</em>). This mode of general censure is not ineffectual. To each of the propositions thus condemned apply one, or several, or all of the censures employed--the task of fitting each censure to each propositions being left to <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologians</a>. Again, some propositions are censured according to their obvious tenor and without reference to their context or author (<em>prout iacent</em>); while others e.g. those of <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a>, Jansen, etc. are stigmatized in the sense intended by their author (<em>in sensu ab auctore intento</em>). Obviously the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not claim to read into the mind of a writer. What she claims is an operative <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> power including the double faculty of pointing out to her children both the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and the fact that such an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is contained in such a book written by such an author. In such cases, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> is bound to accept the whole judgment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, although some <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> would make a difference between the assent due to the condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and the assent due to the designation of the book or author. <li>Vague censures of this kind, <em>Damnandas et proscribendas esse</em>, are more in the nature of simple prohibitions than censures. They mean that a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ought to keep clear of such teachings absolutely, but they do not point out the degree of falsehood or danger attached to them. <li>In a general matter, censures are restrictive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and, as such, to be interpreted strictly. A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> is not debarred from the right of ascertaining, for his own guidance or the guidance of others, their legitimate minimum; but the danger, not always unreal, of falling below that minimum should itself be minimized by what <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> calls "a generous loyalty toward <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority" and the <em>pietas fidei</em>.</ul>
