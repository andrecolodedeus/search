<h1>Theological Definition</h1>  

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> (Sess. iv, cap. iv) solemnly taught the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> in the following terms:

<blockquote><p>"The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a>, when he speaks <em>ex cathedr&acirc;</em>, that is to say, when in the exercise of his office of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> and teacher of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> he, in virtue of his supreme Apostolic authority, defines that a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> is to be held by the whole Church, by the assistance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> promised to him in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Blessed Peter, has that <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> with which it was the will of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Divine Redeemer</a> that His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should be furnished in defining a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>."</p></blockquote>

<p>From this teaching we obtain an authoritative notion of the meaning of definition in its <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, as distinct from its <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a>, or canonical, sense. It is an irrevocable decision, by which the supreme teaching authority in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> decides a question appertaining to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, and which binds the whole Church. From this explanation it will be seen that four conditions are required for a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> definition.
<h2 id="section1">It must be a decision by the supreme teaching authority in the Church</h2>

<p>There are two organs of supreme <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> authority, viz.: the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, speaking in his official capacity of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> and teacher of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> dispersed throughout the world or assembled in a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">successor of St. Peter</a>, has definitive authority, in the exercise of which he speaks neither as a private individual, nor as a mere <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, nor as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, nor as <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of the Roman Province, nor as <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, nor as <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, nor as head of any Roman Congregation, but as supreme <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the whole Church. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> assembled with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> have the same <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> authority with which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is endowed; and so have the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> dispersed throughout the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world when, in conjunction with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, they teach a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> to be irrevocably held by all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. These two supreme teaching authorities are the organs of active <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> from which alone a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> definition can proceed.
<h2 id="section2">The decision must concern a doctrine of faith or morals</h2>

<p>Faith means the speculative doctrines of revelation; <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, the practical doctrines of revelation. <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is what we have to believe, <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> what we have to do, in order to obtain eternal life. Both <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> are parts of the deposit which Christ left for the guidance of His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; so far as the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of assent is concerned, there is no difference between them; the distinction is made for the sake of convenience rather than for the sake of any substantial difference between them so far as they are the objects of active <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a>. Doctrines of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> which are formally revealed are called the direct object of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a>, while doctrines which are only virtually revealed, or are only intimately connected with revelation, such as dogmatic or moral facts, are called the indirect object of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has authority to issue definitions in connexion with both the direct and the indirect objects of active <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a>. It is not, however, <em>de fide</em> that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> authority over the indirect doctrines of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, though it cannot be denied without <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> censure.
<h2 id="section3">The decision must bind the universal Church</h2>

<p>Decrees which bind only a part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are not definitions; but only those which command the assent of all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. It is not, however, absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> should be directly sent or addressed to the whole Church; it is quite sufficient if it is made clear that the supreme teaching authority means to bind the Universal Church. Thus, <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo</a> addressed his famous dogmatic definition to <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a>, yet it was rightly considered as binding the Universal Church; and <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Pope Innocent</a> sent his <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> to the African Church alone, yet St. Augustine exclaimed: <em>Causa finita est, utinam aliquando finiatur <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>!</em> (Serm. ii, de Verb. Ap., c. vii).
<h2 id="section4">The decision must be irrevocable or, as it is called, definitive</h2>

<p>Arguments contained in <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> definitions are proposed by the supreme teaching authority in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they concern <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, and they bind the Universal Church; yet they are not definitions, because they lack this fourth condition &mdash; they are not definitively proposed for the assent of the whole Church. Two things are implied by the statement that a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, to be a definition, must be final and irrevocable. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> must be the last word of supreme teaching authority; there must be no possibility of re-opening the question in a spirit of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>; the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> must settle the matter for ever. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> must also, and in consequence of its final nature, bind the whole Church to an irrevocable internal assent. This assent is at least an assent of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and in doctrines which are formally revealed it is also an assent of Divine <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. When the definition commands an irrevocable assent of Divine <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as well as of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the defined <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> is said to be <em>de fide</em> in the technical sense of this phrase. It is well to note that the definitive nature of a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> does not prevent the defined <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> from being examined anew and defined again by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> or a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>; what it excludes is a re-opening of the question in a spirit of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which has been already definitively settled.

<p>It has been sometimes said that it is impossible to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether or not a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> definition has been issued; but very few words are needed to show that the assertion is without foundation. At times, <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> will remain about the definitive nature of a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, but as a rule no possibility of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> is consistent with the terminology of a definitive <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>. Thus in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> teaching of a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>, <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm"><em>anathema</em></a> attached to condemned <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> is a certain sign of an <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> definition. Words also like those in which <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> solemnly defined the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin give irrefutable <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the definitive nature of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>: "By the authority of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a> and of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and by Our own authority, We declare, pronounce and define the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> . . . to be revealed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and as such to be firmly and immutably held by all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>." No set form of words is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>; any form which clearly indicates that the four requisite conditions are present suffices to show that the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> is a definition in the strict sense. It should be noted that not everything contained in a definition is <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibly</a> defined. Thus, arguments from Scripture, tradition, or <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> reason, do not come under the exercise of definitive authority. Incidental statements, called <em>obiter dicta</em>, are also examples of non-definitive utterances. Only the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> itself, to which those arguments lead and which these <em>obiter dicta</em> illustrate, is to be considered as <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibly</a> defined. (See <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">INFALLIBILITY</a>; <a href="../cathen/03532a.htm">THEOLOGICAL CENSURES</a>; <a href="../cathen/05092a.htm">DOGMATIC FACTS</a>; <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">BEATIFICATION AND CANONIZATION</a>; <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">FAITH</a>.)
