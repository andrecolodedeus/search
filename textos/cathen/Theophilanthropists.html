<h1>Theophilanthropists</h1>  

<p>("Friends of God and Man")

<p>A <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">deistic</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> formed in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> during the latter part of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. The legal substitution of the Constitutional Church, the worship of reason, and the cult of the Supreme Being in place of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Religion had practically resulted in <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheism</a> and immorality. With a view to offsetting those results, some disciples of Rousseau and Robespierre resorted to a new religion, wherein Rousseau's deism and Robespierre's civic virtue (<em>r&#232;gne de la vertu</em>) would be combined. Chemin wrote the "Manuel des th&eacute;ophilanthropes", and Ha73252y offered his institute for the blind as a provisional place of meeting. When, later, the Convention turned over to them the little church of Sainte Catherine, in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, the nascent <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> won a few followers and protectors; still its progress was slow till La R&eacute;velli&#232;re-L&eacute;peaux, an influential member of the Directory, took up its cause. But it was only after the Revolution of 18 Fructidor, which left him master of the situation, that his sympathy bore fruit. Then was the apogee of Theophilanthropism. Blended in a way with the <em>culte d&eacute;cadaire,</em> it came into possession of some of the great churches of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> like Notre Dame, St-Jacques du Haut Pas, St-M&eacute;dard etc; it took a conspicuous part in all the national celebrations, and from the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> passed into the provinces, chiefly the Department of Yonne. The movement, in spite of a strong opposition not only on the part of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> but also from Constitutionals and Philosophers, was gradually taking hold of the masses when the Directory brought it to an abrupt end. The First Consul set his face against the new religionists and they were disbanded. Sporadic attempts at reviving Theophilanthropism were made in the course of the nineteenth century. In 1829, Henri Carle founded "L'alliance religieuse universelle": with "La libre <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>" as its organ, but both <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and periodical disappeared during the Franco-Prussian <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. In 1882, D&eacute;cembre and Valli&#232;res, through "La fraternit&eacute; universelle" and many similar publications, sought directly to reorganize the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, but the attempt failed and, in 1890, D&eacute;cembre confessed the impossibility of arousing public interest. Camerlynck's voluminous book, "Th&eacute;isme", published in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1900, had a similar aim and met a similar fate.

<p>Theophilanthropism is described in the "Manuel du th&eacute;ophilanthropisme", of which there were new editions made as the work progressed. The governing body consisted of two committees, one called "comit&eacute; de direction morale", in charge of the spiritual, the other styled "comit&eacute; des administrateurs" in charge of the temporalities. No dogmatic creed was imposed on the adherents of the new religion, the two fundamental tenets, viz. The <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, being purely sentimental <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> (<em>croyances de sentiment</em>) deemed <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the preservation of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and the welfare of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. The moral teaching considered by far the principal feature of the movement, held a middle position between the severity of <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoicism</a> and the laxity of <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureanism</a>. Its basic principal was good: good is all that tends to preserve and perfect the man; <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is all that tends to destroy or impair him. It is in light of that axiom and not of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> standard &mdash; in spite of the phraseology &mdash; that we should view the commandments concerning the adoration of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of our neighbor, domestic virtues and patriotism.

<p>Theophilanthropist worship was at first very simple and meant chiefly for the home: it consisted in a short invocation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the morning and a kind of <a href="../cathen/05675a.htm">examination of conscience</a> at the end of the day. A plain altar on which were laid some flowers and fruits, a few inscriptions appended to the walls, a platform for the readers or speakers, were the only furnishings allowed. The founders were particularly anxious that this simplicity be strictly adhered to. Nevertheless, the progress of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> led gradually to a much more elaborate ceremonial. It is a far cry from the early meetings where the minister or <em>p&egrave;re de famille</em>, presided at <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> or mimicked <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Christian baptism</a>, First Communion, marriages or funerals, to the gorgeous display of the so-called national festivals. There even was a Theophilanthropist Mass, which, however, came much nearer a <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> service than to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Liturgy. Of the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> adopted by the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, some taken from the writings of <a href="../cathen/13212b.htm">J.B. Rousseau</a>, Madame Deschouli&#232;res, or even <a href="../cathen/12630b.htm">Racine</a>, breathe a noble spirit but, side by side with these, there are bombastic lucubrations like the "Hymne de la fondation de la r&eacute;publique" and the "Hymne a la souverainete du peuple". The same strange combination is found in the feasts where <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and St Vincent de Paul are equally honored and in the sermon where political harangues interlard moral exhortations. Quite noteworthy is Dubroca's funeral oration of George Washington, wherein the orator, under cover of the American hero, catered to the rising <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a> and laid out for him a whole political program which, read in the light of subsequent events, sounds like irony. Despite the hint, <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a> chose to be the Cromwell rather than the Washington of the new religionists.

<p>Under the appearance of moderation, Theophilanthropism was really an anti <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> movement. Whenever <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> was mentioned, it meant the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the first Theophilanthropists were <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Freemasons</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Freemasonry</a> was the leading spirit of the movement throughout. Neither can a secret collusion between <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> and Theophilanthropism, at least in the beginning, be denied. The first <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> really belongs to David Williams, an English minister who exercised considerable influence in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. Chemin consulted the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> before launching his "Manuel". If later, a controversy arose between <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> themselves as to the merits of Theophilanthropism, this was due to the imprudence of Theophilanthropists, who, elated by apparent success, lifted the mask. The constitutional <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, in the national council, held at Notre Dame in 1797, protested against the new religion, and Gregoire wrote in his "Annals de la Religion" (VI, no 5.): "Theophilanthropism is one of those derisive institutions which pretend to bring to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> those very people whom they drive away from Him by estranging them from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. . . .Abhorred by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, it is spurned by <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who, though they may not feel the need of a religion for themselves, still want the people to cling to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of their fathers." <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> went further in their denunciations and exposed, beside the anti-Christian and <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">masonic</a> spirit that animated the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, the political intrigues hiding under the mask of religion. <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pope Pius VI</a>, 17 May 1800 placed an <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> on the churches that had been <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecrated</a> by the deistic rites, and <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Cardinal Consalvi</a>, in the course of the negotiations regarding the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a>, demanded that a speedy end be put to the profanation of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>.
