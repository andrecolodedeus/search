<h1>Theophilus</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a> (385-412). Concerning the extraction and early life of Theophilus we have but scanty information. He had a sister of similar temperament and St. Cyril, his successor, was his nephew. Hydatius ("Chron.", II; P.L., LI, 874) calls him a "most learned man", and dedicates to him an <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> table for 100 years. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> informs us that he did not come forward as a public teacher before 385 ("Contra Rufin.", III, 18, in P.L., XXIII, 492). After his election to the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> (385) he showed himself a man of great <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> gifts and capacity, but also extremely violent and unscrupulous in the choice of his means. His name is connected with three important historical events: the decay of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenistic</a> controversy, and the deposition and banishment of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>. About 390 Theophilus deprived the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> of a temple, probably with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius I</a>, and apparently destroyed several other <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> (<a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, V, 16; Ammian., XXII, xi, 7). A riot ensued, and a number of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were slain. With Theophilus at their head, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> retaliated by destroying the celebrated temple of Serapis, on the ruins of which the patriarch erected a church. He also erected a magnificent church at Canope. In 391 or 392 Theophilus was requested by the Synod of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a> to exert his influence to end the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> at Antioch. However, he failed to establish peace, and it was only in 398 that <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, with the assistance of Theophilus, succeeded in re-establishing <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> communion between Flavian and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>Until 399 Theophilus was regarded as a friend of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenists</a>. Many of the so-called <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenist</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were among his best friends; some of them he appointed to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices and dignities: for example, he named Isidore archpresbyter and patriarchal <em>oeconomos</em>, and raised others to the episcopate. In the quarrel between Johannes-Rufinus and Epiphanius-Jerome he took the side of the first (<a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, VI, 10), informed Jerome through Isidore in 396 that he should show more respect for the authority of his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, John of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (Epp. lxiii and lxxxii; "Contra Rufin.", III, 17; "Contra Johannem Hieros.", 37), and accused <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> of <a href="../cathen/01558c.htm">anthropomorphism</a>. He also banished the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Paulus, an opponent of the <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenists</a>, and reproached <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> for the hospitality he showed him (Jerome, "Contra Rufinum", III, 17 and 78). Between 399 and 400 Theophilus suddenly altered his attitude; the chief motive for the change seems to have been a personal quarrel with the archpresbyter Isidore, well known as a friend of the <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenists</a>. Isidore had taken charge of a sum of money and, in accordance with the express request of the donor, did not inform Theophilus, who suffered from a "mania for building" and <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> (St. Isidore Pelus., Ep. i, 152). The patriarch heard of the matter, however, and did not shrink from the vilest <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> against Isidore and even acts of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> (Pall., VI; <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, VIII, 12). Isidore found protection with his friends, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Nitria, whereupon Theophilus turned against them also. At first he set the anthropomorphic-minded <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenists</a>, against them, although he had condemned their views in his Easter letter of 399 (<a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, VIII, 11; Cassian, "Coll.", X, 2), then directed against them his Easter letter of 401 (P.L., XXI, 773), and finally condemned <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenism</a> at the Synod of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> in 401.

<p>Then placing himself at the head of soldiers and armed servants he marched against the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, burned their dwellings, and ill-treated those whom he captured (Pall., vii; <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, VI, 7; for Jerome's congratulations to Theophilus see Jerome, Ep. lxxxvi). The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, about 300 in number, proceeded first to Palestine, where the majority of them settled near Scythopolis; the four Tall Brethren meanwhile proceeded to Constantinople to ask protection and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> from <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> and the emperor. Theophilus was summoned to Constantinople to answer their charges, and thus begins his connection with the tragedy of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, which soon took the first place in his and the public interest (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">ST. JOHN CHRYSOSTOM</a>). At the Synod of the Oak in 403 Theophilus concluded an equitable peace with the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and on his return to Alexandria is said to have again received the books of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (<a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, VI, 17). That Theophilus may have been really very "broad-minded", is shown by the fact that he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Synesius <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> about 410, although the latter had not yet been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and had stipulated that, as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he might retain his wife and adhere to his <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> views (pre-existence of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, allegorical explanation of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, etc.). As a writer Theophilus did not attain much prominence. In addition to his Easter letters, of which three are extant in a Latin translation by Jerome (P.L., XXII, and P.G., LXV, 53 sqq.), he wrote "one large volume against <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>" (Gennadius, 33), of which some fragments are preserved (collected in <a href="../cathen/06349c.htm">Gallandi</a>, "Bibl. vet. patr.", VII, 801-52; P.G., LXV, 33-68; Zahn, "Forschungen zur Gesch. des neutest. Kanons", II, Erlangen, 1883, p. 234 sqq.). The Canons ascribed to Theophilus are in Pitra, "Juris eccles. Graecor. hist. et monum.", I (Rome, 1864), 546-649. Inauthentic and <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> writings were also in circulation under Theophilus's name (Gennadius, 33: "Legi et tres libros suo nomine titulatos, sed lingua inconsonans est. Non valde credidi").
