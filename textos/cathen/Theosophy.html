<h1>Theosophy</h1>  

<p>(<em>Theosophia</em> = "wisdom concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>")

<p><em>Theosophy</em> is a term used in general to designate the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> supposed to be obtained by the direct <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> of the Divine essence. In method it differs from <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> obtained by <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, and from philosophy, which is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine things acquire by human <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reasoning</a>. It is often incorrectly confounded with <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>, for the latter is properly the thirst for the Divine, the aspiration for the invisible, and hence a natural manifestation of the religious sentiment. By <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> or illumination the initiated Theosophists are considered to be in harmony with the central principle of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. This <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the secret forces of nature of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> relation between the world and man frees them from the ordinary limitations of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>, and gives them a peculiar power over the hidden forces of the macrocosm. Their exceptional faculties are alleged as experimental <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their superior <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>: they are the only guarantee of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of their teaching. They are said to transmit this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by way of revelation. Thus theosophy appeals to tradition but not in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sense.

<p>(1) <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> is the home of all theosophic speculation. Oltramere says that the directive <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> civilization is theosophic. This development covers a great many ages, each represented in Indian religious literature. There are formed the basic principles of theosophy. Knowledge of the occult <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> in nature and in life, the <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuitive method</a>, superhuman powers, hostility to established religion are not all equally apparent in each age, but are present conjunctively or separately through the whole course of its history. The early Brahmanic writings contain the germs, which have gradually developed into a rich vegetation of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>. These <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are organized into systems, not however homogeneous or autonomous but mixed with other <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. Then they leave the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> to act upon the masses, either in forming a religion, e.g. <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a>, or in penetrating popular <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> already existing, e.g. <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hinduism</a>. Thus the Upanishads teach: that the individual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is identical with the universal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, hence the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <em>advaita</em>, i.e. non-duality; that the individual existence of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a state of suffering, hence the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <em>samsara</em>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/10234d.htm">metempsychosis</a>; that the individual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is delivered from suffering by its reunion with the universal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, a reunion realized by seizing the consciousness of identity with it, hence the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <em>moksa</em>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. The basic doctrines of the Vedanta and Saukhya systems are <a href="../cathen/10483a.htm">monistic</a> <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> as the supreme means to reach <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/10234d.htm">metempsychosis</a>, the world of sense is only a very little part of the category of things, the theory and method of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> strictly <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>. These systems developed form the Upanishads. The final development is the Yoga. Yoga, i.e. "one who fits himself, or exercises", refers to the exercises practiced to free the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the body, which to it is like a string to a bird. Some of these exercises were: to rid one's self of moral faults (though the masters do not agree as to what these faults are); to sit in certain painful postures, check the breath, and reduce thought to a minimum by staring at the tip of the nose; to place the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in a particular part of the body, and so gradually acquire mastery over it, or, rather, let the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> self, acquire mastery over the body; to stave and learn to subsist on air or even without it; to concentrate thought by meditation, i.e. to think of nothing. <em>Thyana</em>, the highest state of which is the cataleptic trance <em>samadhi</em>, in which the mind is suppressed but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in full activity. In this sate the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is a <em>mahatma</em>, i.e. master-soul and can enjoy a temporary release from the body which it leaves to go roaming about, performing wonderful feats on material nature and controlling other less powerful <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. This latter was the secret of the Yoga's real power and was supposed to be done by a transfer of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> re-enters the body, the Yoga wakes and is like other people. By repeated exercises the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can become so strong that is secures perpetual release from the body, thus, according to the older Yoga teaching, it flies to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> where it enjoys great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, riding in a celestial car attended by lovely <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and music; but with the latter Yogas, on breaking all bodily bonds it formed immediate absorption into the Supreme Soul.

<p>(2) Theosophic teaching comes to the front in the third period of Greek philosophy. Hence it is found in the Jewish-Greek philosophy with the <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonists</a>. The theosophic atmosphere due to the influence of the Orient is plainly shown in Plotinus. The <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> systems reveal more theosophy than <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and in the Jewish <a href="../cathen/08590a.htm">Kabbala</a> is found a theosophy mixed with various forms of magic and occultism. The <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> brought into modern thought <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonism</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08590a.htm">Kabbala</a>, e.g. Reuchlin (d. 1492), <a href="../cathen/01231c.htm">Agrippa</a> (d. 1535), <a href="../cathen/03332a.htm">Cardano</a> (d. 1576), Paracelsus (d.1540), Weigel (d. 1588). More important is the teaching of Jakob B&ouml;hme (d.1624). He taught that the "eternal <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a>" of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the ultimate cause of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; that there is a "dark" negative principle in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> element makes manifest His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Without this there would be no revelation. Further, were it not for this principle <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Himself. B&ouml;hme's teaching influenced <a href="../cathen/02173a.htm">Baader</a>, Schelling, and Gegel. Theosophic principles colour the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of <a href="../cathen/14355a.htm">Swedenborg</a>, and are found in the group of modern thinkers, especially neo-Hegelians, who claim that the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by direct <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> or by a special faculty of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.



<p>A new importance of these teachings in modern thought is due to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Modern theosophy <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the foundation of the Theosophical Society in New York City by Madame Blavatsky in 1875. She is the chief and only authority for the revelation of so-called Tibetan occultism. A.P. Sinnett however used the term Esoteric <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a>. They claimed to have the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> solution for the problems of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> and of man from the Upanishads and <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> Sutras through Oriental savants, <em>mahatmas</em>, the faithful depositories of a profound and superhuman wisdom. In fact, a great part of their nomenclature is derived from <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and they seek there for a justification of teachings drifting about in modern thought and derived to a great extent, if not wholly, from <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonic</a> and Jewish sources through the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. The objects of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> are: to form the nucleus of a universal brotherhood of humanity without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste, or colour; to encourage the study of comparative <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>; to investigate the unexplained <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of nature and the powers latent in man. This last clause gives occasion to include magic, the occult, the uncanny, and the marvelous in any and every form. Madame Blavatsky, with Colonel Olcott, went to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> in 1878. Shortly afterwards her <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">frauds</a> were exposed through letters written by her and published by Columb and his wife, who had been in her service. This was acknowledged by the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Society of Psychical Research, which in Nov., 1884 sent R. Hodgson, of St. John's College, Cambridge to investigate (Edmund Garrett, "Isis very much Unveiled", London, 1895; Francis Podmore, "Studies in Psychical Research"). In spite of this, however, the teaching was continued and propagated by her disciples Mrs. Besant, Col. Olcott, A.P. Sinnett, and others.

<p>Modern theosophy claims to be a definite <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. Its teachings are the product of thought, and its source is consciousness, not any <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>. As a <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> it is supposed to be based on investigation and experimentation of the occult <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> in nature and in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>. Only those qualified for the inquiry can grasp these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and they gain from this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> certain superhuman powers. Mrs. Besant calls it the great synthesis of life, i.e. of religion, <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, and philosophy, as old as thoughtful humanity, proclaimed in a new form suited to the present time. Its aim is that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> is and can become the master of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Hence it is considered as a protest against materialism which teaches that thought and feeling are the results of the aggregations of matter. Theosophy on the contrary sees in matter an instrument of life, and in thought the creative and moulding power of matter.

<p>The basic teaching of theosophy is the universal brotherhood of humanity. Hence springs the preaching of toleration to all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and to all varieties of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, e.g. <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhists</a>, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">Atheists</a>, It considers the different <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> as methods adopted by man in the search for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. They are of necessity various, because men differ in temperament, type, needs, and stages of evolution. Hence they are different and imperfect expressions of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. As such it says: "we cannot afford to lose any of the world's <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, for each has its partial <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and its characteristic message which the perfect man must acquire." Hence theosophy appeals to men as the great peacemaker, for it teaches that all <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> mean one and the same thing, or rather that they are all branches of a single tree. In this sense it attacks comparative mythology which tries to show that religion was originally the fruit of man's <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> wand will disappear with the increase of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, whereas in fact religion comes from Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, i.e. theosophy.

<p>The principle of universal brotherhood rest upon the 'solidarity' of all living, of all that is, in the one life and one consciousness. Solidarity springs from the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the immanence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the only and external life manifested in the multiplicity of creation. All forces are external; there is no <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, except the superhuman and supersensuous, i.e. powers greater that those normally exercised by man, which, however, can be developed. Ignorance therefore makes the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. Hence there is on personal <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and for this reason Madame Blavatsky and Mrs. Besant say that theosophy is more readily embraced by <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">Atheists</a> and <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnostics</a>. Hence also Colville could teach that the spirit or <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in man is the only real and permanent part of his being; everything else pertaining to him is illusory and transitory. Solidarity, i.e. the common life pervading all things, is thus made the basis of morality. Hence a wrong done to one is done to all, as e.g. an injury inflicted on one part of the human organism results in pain diffused and felt throughout. At the same time we are told that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is good and man <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, that the "immanence of God justifies religion", i.e. the search after Him, that all things move to good and to man's benefit, that man must understand and co-operate with the scheme of things.

<p>Man has seven aspects, or rather is being composed of seven principles. These are viewed in two groups: the Quarternary, corresponding to our animal nature, i.e. <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, the mortal part of man, the products of evolution; and the Triad, corresponding to our spiritual nature, i.e. spirit, for theosophists say that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> philosophy hold the threefold division of body; <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and spirit in man. The Quaternary is made up of <em>Sthula Sharira</em>, i.e. physical body; <em>Linga Sharira</em>, i.e. astral double; <em>Prana</em>, i.e. principle of life; <em>Kama</em>, i.e. our passional nature. The Triad is composed of: <em>Manas</em>, i.e. mind or the thinker; <em>Buddhi</em>, i.e. the dwelling-place of spirit; <em>Atnir</em>, i.e. spirit. Hence we find <em>Atnir-Buddhi</em> used conjointly. This Triad is called the Immortal Triad. It is united to the Quaternary by <em>Manas</em>, in itself viewed as <em>Higher Manas</em>, sending out a Ray, which as <em>Lower Manas</em> is imbedded in <em>Karma</em>. Thus <em>Kama-Manas</em> is the link joining our animal to our spiritual nature, and is the battle-ground of life's struggles. Man is primarily divine, a spark of the Divine life; this living flame passing out from the Central Fire, weaves for itself coverings within which it dwells and thus becomes the Triad, the <em>Atma-Buddhi-Manas</em>, the Immortal Self. This sends out its Ray, which becomes encased in grosser matter, in the Kamic body, in the Astral Double, and in the physical body. The Astral Double, i.e. rarer matter, the exact double of the physical body, plays a great part in spiritualistic phenomena. The <em>Manas</em> is the real I, the reincarnating ego makes the human <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>. The Quaternary as a whole is viewed as the Personality, i.e. the shadow of the self. In fact each principle or aspect may be considered a Personality in so far as it undervalues <em>Atma</em>, i.e. throws its shadow over <em>Atma</em>, i.e. the One Eternal Existence. The seer however knows that <em>Atma</em> is the one reality, the essence of all things, that <em>Atma-Buddhi</em> is the Universal One Soul, itself an aspect of <em>Atma</em>, that <em>Atma-Buddhi-Manas</em> is the individual mind or Thinker, that the shadow of <em>Manas</em>, our <em>Atma-Buddhi</em>, makes men say "my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>" and "thy soul", whereas in reality we are all one with <em>Atma</em>, the Unknown Root. After death all of the Manasic Ray that is pure and unsoiled gradually disentangles itself, carrying with it such of life's experiences as are of a nature fit for assimilation with the Higher Ego. The Manasic Ego united to <em>Atma-Buddhi</em> passes into the Devachonic state of consciousness, rapt in blissful dreams coloured by the experiences of the earth-life. This state is a continuation of the earth-life shorn of its sorrows, and a completion of its noble and pure wishes.

<p>Theosophy is not only a basis of religion; it is also a philosophy of life. As such, its main teachings are reincarnation and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of Karma. Karma is the outcome of the collective life, a law of <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causation</a>. In the past incarnation the ego had acquired certain faculties, set in motion certain causes. The effect of these causes and of causes set in motion in previous incarnations and not yet exhausted are its Karma and determine the conditions into which the ego is reborn. Thus inequalities of natural gifts, e.g. genius, of temperament and of character are explained. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of progress is the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of involution and evolution, the returning of the Divine Spark into a unity with Spirit through various reincarnations, which are viewed as a process of purification. Sin, poverty, and misery are the fruits of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and are gradually removed as the spirit in us becomes freed from earthly dross. There is no <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> nor <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">Hell</a>. Death is the passage from this state of life to another. There is an evolution behind and before, with absolute <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of final attainment for every human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, i.e. to be one with the <a href="../cathen/01060c.htm">Absolute</a>. As man advances in this process his spirit becomes stronger, and can develop latent powers, not shown in ordinary mortals.
<h2>Criticism</h2>

<p>In of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> phraseology, theosophy in reality is a form of <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a>, and denies a personal <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and personal <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. Its appeal to the spiritual in man, and its striving after union with the Divine are based upon a contradictory <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysic</a>, an imaginary <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a>, a system of ethics which recognizes no <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, but only the absolute necessity of Karma. No evidence or <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> is given for its teaching except the simple statements of its leaders. The denial of a personal <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> nullifies its claim to be a spiritualistic philosophy. Judging it as presented by its own exponents, it appears to be a strange mixture of <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>, charlatanism, and thaumaturgic pretension combined with an eager effort to express its teaching in words which reflect the atmosphere of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ethics and modern scientific <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>.
