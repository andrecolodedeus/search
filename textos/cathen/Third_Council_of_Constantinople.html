<h1>Third Council of Constantinople</h1>  

<p>(SIXTH GENERAL COUNCIL.)

<p>The Sixth General Council was summoned in 678 by <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> Pogonatus, with a view of restoring between East and West the religious harmony that had been troubled by the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelistic</a> controversies, and particularly by the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of his predecessor Constans II, whose imperial edict, known as the "Typus" (648-49) was a practical suppression of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Owing to the desire of Pope Agatho to obtain the adhesion of his Western brethren, the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> did not arrive at Constantinople until late in 680. The council, attended in the beginning by 100 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, later by 174, was opened 7 Nov., 680, in a domed hall (<em>trullus</em>) of the imperial palace and was presided over by the (three) <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> who brought to the council a long dogmatic letter of Pope Agatho and another of similar import from a Roman <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held in the spring of 680. They were read in the second session. Both letters, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> in particular, insist on the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> as the living and stainless tradition of the Apostles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, assured by the promises of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, witnessed by all the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> in their capacity of successors to the Petrine privilege of confirming the brethren, and therefore finally authoritative for the Universal Church.

<p>The greater part of the eighteen sessions was devoted to an examination of the Scriptural and patristic passages bearing on the question of one or two wills, one or two operations, in Christ. George, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, soon yielded to the evidence of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> teaching concerning the two wills and two operations in Christ, but <a href="../cathen/09483b.htm">Macarius of Antioch</a>, "almost the only certain representative of <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelism</a> since the nine propositions of <a href="../cathen/04597c.htm">Cyrus of Alexandria</a>" (Chapman), resisted to the end, and was finally <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> and deposed for "not consenting to the tenor of the orthodox letters sent by Agatho the most holy pope of Rome", i.e., that in each of the two natures (human and Divine) of Christ there is a perfect operation and a perfect will, against which the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelites</a> had taught that there was but one operation and one will (<em>mia energeia theandrike</em>) quite in consonance with the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> confusion of the two natures in Christ. In the thirteenth session (28 March, 681) after <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizing</a> the chief <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelitic</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> mentioned in the aforesaid letter of Pope Agatho, i.e. Sergius of Constantinople, <a href="../cathen/04597c.htm">Cyrus of Alexandria</a>, Pyrrhus, Paul, and Peter of Constantinople, and Theodore of Pharan, the council added: "And in addition to these we decide that Honorius also, who was Pope of Elder <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, be with them cast out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Holy Church of God</a>, and be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> with them, because we have found by his letter to Sergius that he followed his opinion in all things and confirmed his wicked <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>." A similar condemnation of Pope Honorius occurs in the dogmatic <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the final session (16 Sept., 681), which was signed by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> and the emperor. Reference is here made to the famous letter of Honorius to Sergius of Constantinople about 634, around which has arisen (especially before and during the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>) so large a controversial literature. It had been invoked three times in previous sessions of the council in question by the stubborn <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelite</a> <a href="../cathen/09483b.htm">Macarius of Antioch</a>, and had been publicly read in the twelfth session together with the letter of Sergius to which it replied. On that occasion a second letter of Honorius to Sergius was also read, of which only a fragment has survived. (For the question of this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, see HONORIUS I; <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">INFALLIBILITY</a>; <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">MONOTHELITES</a>.)

<p>There has been in the past, owing to Gallicanism and the opponents of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>, much controversy concerning the proper sense of this council's condemnation of Pope Honorius, the theory (<a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, <a href="../cathen/04614b.htm">Damberger</a>) of a falsification of the Acts being now quite abandoned (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, III, 299-313). Some have maintained, with Pennacchi, that he was indeed condemned as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, but that the Oriental <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the council misunderstood the thoroughly <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> (and dogmatic) letter of Honorius; others, with Hefele, that the council condemned the heretically sounding expressions of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (though his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was really <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>); others finally, with Chapman (see below), that he was condemned <blockquote> because he did not, as he should have done, declare authoritatively the Petrine tradition of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. To that tradition he had made no appeal but had merely approved and enlarged upon the half-hearted compromise of Sergius. . . Neither the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> nor the council consider that Honorius had compromised the purity of the Roman tradition, for he had never claimed to represent it. Therefore, just as today we judge the letters of Pope Honorius by the Vatican definition and deny them to be <em>ex cathedra</em>, because they do not define any <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and impose it upon the whole Church, so the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the seventh century judged the same letters by the custom of their day, and saw that they did not claim what <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">papal letters</a> were wont to claim, viz., to speak with the mouth of Peter in the name of Roman tradition. (Chapman) </blockquote>

<p>The letter of the council to Pope Leo, asking, after the traditional manner, for confirmation of its Acts, while including again the name of Honorius among the condemned <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelites</a>, lay a remarkable stress on the magisterial office of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, as, in general, the documents of the Sixth General Council favour strongly the inerrancy of the See of Peter. "The Council", says Dom Chapman, "accepts the letter in which the Pope defined the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. It deposes those who refused to accept it. It asks [the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>] to confirm its decisions. The Bishops and Emperor declare that they have seen the letter to contain the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Fathers. Agatho speaks with the voice of Peter himself; from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> had gone forth as out of Sion; Peter had kept the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unaltered." Pope Agatho died during the Council and was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/09157a.htm">Leo II</a>, who confirmed (683) the decrees against <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelism</a>, and expressed himself even more harshly than the council towards the memory of Honorius (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, Chapman), though he laid stress chiefly on the neglect of that <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to set forth the traditional teaching of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, whose spotless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he treasonably tried to overthrow (or, as the Greek may be translated, permitted to be overthrown).
