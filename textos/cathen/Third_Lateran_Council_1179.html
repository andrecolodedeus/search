<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Third Lateran Council (1179)</h1>  

<p>The reign of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> was one of the most laborious pontificates of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Then, as in 1139, the object was to repair the evils caused by the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>. Shortly after returning to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (12 March, 1178) and receiving from its inhabitants their <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of fidelity and certain indispensable guarantees, Alexander had the satisfaction of receiving the submission of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/03187a.htm">Callistus III</a> (John de Struma). The latter, besieged at <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> by Christian of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, eventually yielded and, at Tusculum, made his submission to Pope Alexander (29 August, 1178), who received him with kindness and appointed him Governor of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Beneventum</a>. Some of his obstinate partisans sought to substitute a new <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, and chose one Lando Sitino, under the name of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>. For lack of support he soon gave up the struggle and was relegated to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of La Cava. In September, 1178, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in agreement with an article of the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, convoked an <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> at the Lateran for <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> of the following year and, with that object, sent <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to different countries. This was the eleventh of the ecumenical councils. It met in March, 1179. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> presided, seated upon an elevated throne, surrounded by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and by the prefects, senators, and consuls of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The gathering numbered three hundred and two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, among them several Latin <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of Eastern <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. There were in all nearly one thousand members. Nectarius, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the Cabules, represented the Greeks. The East was represented by <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> <a href="../cathen/15639a.htm">William of Tyre</a> and Heraclius of Caesarea, Prior Peter of the Holy Sepulchre, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a>. <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> sent nineteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, six; <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, only one- <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, seven; <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, fifty nine; <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, seventeen- <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, one each. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> had at their head St. Laurence, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, in the presence of the council, two <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and two Scottish, one of whom had come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with only one horse the other on foot. There was also present an <a href="../cathen/07615b.htm">Icelandic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who had no other revenue than the milk of three cows, and when one of these went dry his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> furnished him with another.

<p>Besides exterminating the remains of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> the council undertook the condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldensian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and the restoration of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>, which had been much relaxed. Three sessions were held, on 5, 14, and 19 March, in which twenty-seven canons were <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, the most important of which may be summarized as follows: <ul><li>Canon 1: To prevent <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a> in future, only the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> should have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to elect the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and two-thirds of their votes should be required for the validity of such election. If any candidate, after securing only one-third of the votes, should arrogate to himself the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> dignity, both he and his partisans should be excluded from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. <li>Canon 2: Annulment of the ordinations performed by the heresiarchs Octavian and Guy of <a href="../cathen/04481b.htm">Crema</a>, as well as those by John de Struma. Those who have received <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignities</a> or <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> from these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are deprived of the same; those who have freely sworn to adhere to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> are declared suspended. <li>Canon 3: It is forbidden to promote anyone to the episcopate before the age of thirty. Deaneries, archdeaconries, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> charges, and other <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> involving the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> shall not be conferred upon anyone less than twenty-five years of age. <li>Canon 4 regulates the retinue of members of the higher <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, whose canonical visits were frequently ruinous to the rural <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Thenceforward the train of an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> is not to include more than forty or fifty horses; that of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, not more than twenty or thirty; that of an <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, five or seven at the most &#151; the dean is to have two. <li>Canon 5 forbids the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> not provided with an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> title, i.e. means of proper support. If a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> ordains a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> without assigning him a certain title on which he can subsist, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall provide such cleric with means of livelihood until he can assure him an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> revenue that is, if the cleric cannot subsist on his patrimony alone. <li>Canon 6 regulates the formalities of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> sentences. <li>Canon 7 forbids the exaction of a sum of money for the burial of the dead, the marriage benediction, and, in general, for the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. <li>Canon 8: The patrons of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> shall nominate to such <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> within six months after the occurrence of a vacancy. <li>Canon 9 recalls the <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military orders</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> to the observation of canonical regulations, from which the churches dependent on them are in no wise exempt. <li>Canon 11 forbids <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> to receive <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in their houses, or to frequent, without necessity, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. <li>Canon 14 forbids <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> to transfer to other <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> which they possess, under pain of being debarred from the communion of the faithful and deprived of <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">Christian burial</a>. <li>Canon 18 provides for the establishment in every <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> of a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for poor <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. <li>Canon 19: <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">Excommunication</a> aimed at those who levy contributions on churches and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchmen</a> without the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. <li>Canon 20 forbids tournaments. <li>Canon 21 relates to the <a href="../cathen/15068a.htm">"Truce of God"</a>. <li>Canon 23 relates to the organization of asylums for <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>. <li>Canon 24 consists of a prohibition against furnishing the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> with material for the construction of their galleys. <li>Canon 27 enjoins on princes the repression of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.</ul>
