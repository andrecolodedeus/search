<h1>Third Orders</h1>  

<h2 id="i">General</h2>

<p>Third Orders signify in general lay members of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, i.e. men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who do not necessarily live in community and yet can claim to wear the habit and participate in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> of some great order.
<h3 id="A">Origin</h3>

<p>The general <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of lay people affiliated to <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, as seen in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11188a.htm">Oblates</a> or <em>confraters</em> (<a href="../cathen/14466a.htm">Taunton</a>, "Black Monks of St. Benedict", London, 1897, I, 60-63; for <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertines</a> cf. <a href="../cathen/07583c.htm">Hurter</a>, "Papst Innocenz III", Schaffhausen, 1845, IV, 148), is too natural for there to be any need to seek its origin. Founders and benefactors of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were received in life into spiritual fellowship, and were clothed in death in some religious habit. So too the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> had a whole system whereby layfolk could partake in some sort in their privileges and in the material administration of their affairs (English Hist. Rev., London, April, 1910, 227). But the essential nature of the tertiary is really an innovation of the thirteenth century. At that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> many of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, impatient of the indolent and sometimes <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> lives of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in lower <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, were seized with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of reforming <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> by preaching. This admirable intention caused the rise of the Vaudois under Valdez of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> ("Anecdotes Historiques tir&eacute;s du Recueil in&eacute;dit d'Etienne de Bourbon, O.P.", ed. by Lecoq de La Manche, Paris, 1878, 290-314), and under somewhat more curious conditions the Fratres <a href="../cathen/07543a.htm">Humiliati</a>. The Vaudois were at first welcomed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, who authorized their preaching, but as they were unacquainted with <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> teaching and had pursued no <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> studies, their sermons were not seldom dogmatically inaccurate and eventually defiantly <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07543a.htm">Humiliati</a> also soon became suspect and were forbidden by Lucius III to preach, till in 1207 <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> gave a section of them permission to resume their work, provided that they limited themselves to moral questions and did not venture on <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> subjects ("De articulis fidei et sacramentis ecclesiae", cf. <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, O.P., "Archiv f&uuml;r Litteratur und Kirchengeschichte des Mittelalters", I, 419). Moreover some became <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, were gathered into a <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, and took up <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. The others remained outside, yet spiritually dependent on the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> portion, and now for the first time in history called a Third Order, <em>Tertius Ordo</em> (Mandonnet, "Les Origines de l'Ordo de P&oelig;netentia"; the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> is to be found in <a href="../cathen/14738b.htm">Tiraboschi</a>, "Vetera Humiliatorum monumenta", II, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 1766-68, 139).
<h3 id="B">Division</h3>

<p>The Third Orders can each be divided into (a) regulars, i.e. living in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and (b) seculars, i.e. living in the world. Of these the first take <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, the latter can only make a solemn promise (except that <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Tertiaries apparently take some sort of <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of obedience and chastity, cf. Angelus a S.S. Corde, O.C.D., "Manuale juris communis Regularium", <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, 1899, q. 1067), which, however, distinguishes them from members of mere confraternities and constitutes them legally a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order (Constitution of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, "Misericors Dei Filius").
<h3 id="C">Members</h3>

<p>Any <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> may join a Third Order, but may not at once belong to more than one, nor may he without grave cause leave one for another. The laying aside of the distinctive sign or <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for any space of time does not in itself put an end to membership with a Third Order, but the deliberate wish to dissociate oneself from it is sufficient to produce that effect (S. Cong. Indulg., 31 Jan., 1893).
<h3 id="D">Privileges</h3>

<p>The Regular Third Order participates in all the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> granted to the First and Second Orders (S. Cong. Indulg., 28 Aug., 1903), but not in those granted to the Secular Third Order (ibid.). This latter no longer participates in any privileges save those directly granted to itself (S. Cong. Indulg., 31 Jan., 1893; S. Cong. Indulg., 18 July, 1902; S. Cong. Indulg., 28 Aug., 1903).

<h2 id="ii">Third order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel</h2>

<p>Soon after the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel</a> was established in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in the thirteenth century, <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay persons</a>, not bound by religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, seem to have attached themselves to it more or less closely. There is evidence of the existence of a "Confrairie N.-D. du Mont-Carmel" at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> in 1273, and of a "Compagnia di Santa Maria del Carmino" at Bologna in 1280, but the exact nature of these bodies is uncertain owing to a lack of documents. Somewhat later mention is frequently made of trade-guilds having their seat in churches of the order, members of which acted as their <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>. Thus the master-bakers, innkeepers and pastry-cooks at <a href="../cathen/11083a.htm">N&icirc;mes</a>, the barbers and surgeons of the same town, who were also connected with the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, the goldsmiths at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. Benefactors of the order received letters of fraternity with the right of participation in the privileges and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>. Others, under the name of <em>bizzoche</em> and <em>mantellatoe</em>, wore the habit and observed the rule, e.g. "M. Phicola nostra Pinzochera" at Florence in 1308. Others again became <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluses</a> in the anchorages attached to <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> churches, and made profession under the form: "Ego frater N. a Spiritu Sancto ad anachoreticam vitam vocatus offero me, coram Deo, Patri et Filio et Spiritui Sancto, et promitto me in servitio Dei secundum Scripturam sacram Novi et Veteris Testamenti more anchoreticae vitae usque ad mortem permansurum." Among the tertiaries not living in community must be mentioned Blessed Louis Morbioli of Bologna (d. 1495).



<p>The <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a> of the third order dates from the middle of the fifteenth century, when a community of <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beguines</a> at Guelders sought affiliation to the order, and Blessed John Soreth, General of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, obtained a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> (7 Oct., 1452) granting the superiors of his order the faculties enjoyed by the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Hermits of St. Augustine</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> of canonically establishing <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of "virgins, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, beguines and mantellatae". Further legislation took place in 1476 by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Mare magnum privilegiorum", and under <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> and his successors. The rule observed by the tertiaries, whether living in the world or gathered into communities, was originally that of the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> with modifications as required by their status. Theodor Stratius, General of the Calced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, composed in 1635 a new rule, revised in 1678, which is still observed among the tertiaries of the Calced and the Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>. It prescribes the recitation of the canonical office, or else of the <a href="../cathen/09294a.htm">Little Office of the Blessed Virgin</a>, or, in its place, of the Pater noster and Ave Maria to be said thirty-five times a day, five times in lieu of each of the <a href="../cathen/07500b.htm">canonical hours</a>; also half an hour's meditation every morning and evening; <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> on all Fridays and also on Wednesdays and Saturdays from 14 September till <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, abstinence during <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> and <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, and various works of <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, devotion, and charity. Superiors may in their discretion dispense from some of these <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>.

<p>It is impossible to estimate even approximately the number of tertiaries living in the world. Besides these there are numerous corporations of tertiaries established in different countries, viz. two communities of tertiary brothers in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> (Drumcondra and Clondalkin near Dublin) in charge of an asylum for the blind and of a high-school for boys; eighteen communities of native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in British <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> belonging partly to the Latin and partly to the Syro-Malabar rites; four houses of <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of Christian Education</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Far more numerous are the communities of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, namely twenty-three in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> (Latin and Syro-Malabar rites) for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of native girls, and four <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> in connection with the missions of the Order; two congregations of tertiaries in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> with nineteen and forty-eight establishments respectively, and one unattached, for <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> there are also tertiary <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> called "Carmelitas de la caridad" engaged in <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a> with 150 establishments. The Austrian congregation of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> numbers twenty-seven houses, while the most recent branch, the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Tertiaries of the Sacred Heart, founded at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> towards the end of the last century for the care and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> and neglected children, have spread rapidly through <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and have twenty houses. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> there are three different congregations with thirty-two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>. There are smaller branches of the tertiaries in South America with two houses at <a href="../cathen/13460a.htm">Santiago</a>, <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> with four <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> with one.

<h2 id="iii">The Third Order Secular of the Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel</h2>

<p>The Third Order Secular of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel</a> has been introduced into the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. There are at present two congregations, with 125 members.

<h2 id="iv">Third Order of St. Dominic</h2>
<h3>Origin</h3>

<p>This was one of the earliest developments of St. Francis's Ordo de Poenitentia. It was not indeed the primal organism from which the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Friars Preachers</a> evolved, but rather represents that portion of the Order of Penance which came under <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> influence. At first vaguely constituted and living without system or form, its members gradually grew more and more dependent on their spiritual guides. The climax was reached, and the work of St. Francis received its final perfection, when Mu&ntilde;on de Zamora, the seventh master-general of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Friars Preachers</a>, formulated a definite rule in 1285. By this the Ordo de Poenitentia was to be ruled in each local centre by a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (Federici, "Istoria de cavalieri Gaudenti", <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1787, Codex Diplomaticus, II, 35) and was to be subject to the obedience of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincials</a> and master-generals. No longer were there to be any of those vague transitions and extravagant vagaries (ibid., 28) which disfigured in history these Orders of Penance. Henceforward this branch was linked to the fortunes of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Friars Preachers</a>, wore their habits of black and white (with few minor differences varying according to time and country), and was to participate in all their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>. They were not called a third order indeed until after the thirteenth century (Mandonnet, "Les r&egrave;gles et le gouvernement de l'ordo de Poenitentia", Paris, 1902, p. 207) but continued to be known as "Brothers and Sisters of Penance" with the addition "of St. Dominic", that is "The Brothers and Sisters of the Penance of St. Dominic".

<p>Simultaneously with them there came into being another and very different institution which, however, subsequently amalgamated with the Ordo de Poenitentia to form the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Third Order. This was a <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military order</a>, called the <em>Militia Jesu Christi</em> (soldiery of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>) created for the defence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>. It owed its origin to Bishop Foulques of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, Simon de Montfort (Federici, "Istoria de cavalieri Gaudenti", Codex Diplomaticus, I), and not improbably to St. Dominic, then a canon of St. Augustine. This connection with the founder of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Friars Preachers</a> is first definitely propounded by Bl. Raymund of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, who became a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> about 1350. But the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this assertion is borne out by several other indications. As early as 1235, <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> confided the Militia to the care of Bl. Jordan of Saxony, second master-general, by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 18 May (Federici, op. cit., 10); and in the same year he decreed for the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> a habit of black and white (op. cit., 14). Further, when the Militia was brought across the Alps and established in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> it is found to be always connected with some <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> church (op. cit., I, 13). Lastly, it was very largely influenced by a famous <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Fra Bartolomeo of Braganza, or of <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>, as he is sometimes called (op. cit., I, 12, 42, etc.). Originally working side by side and independent of each other, owing to the fact that both received the same spiritual administration of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Friars Preachers</a>, they appear to have been merged together at the close of the thirteenth century. This is what Raymond of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a> implies as the result of his researches. So too their ultimate coincidence is hinted at by <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> in 1221 when he designates the Militia "nomine poenitentiae" (Federici, Codex Diplomaticus), and a comparison also of the rules of the two institutions: that of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> for the Militia in 1235 (op. cit., 12-16) and that of Mu&ntilde;on de Zamora for the Order of Penance of St. Dominic in 1285 (op. cit., 28-36) would lead one to the same conclusion. The only considerable difference that could be cited against this identify is that Mu&ntilde;on de Zamora expressly forbids the carrying of arms. But this is in reality but a further <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their approximation, for he allows for the one exception which could possibly apply to the Militia, viz. in defence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (ibid., 32). This amalgamation is admitted by the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> to have become general in the fourteenth century (Acta Sanctorum, Aug., I, 418-422). From this double movement therefore, i.e. from the Ordo de Poenitentia S. Dominici and the Militia Jesu Christi, was born the modern Third <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a>. Though its source is therefore anterior to the First Order, its full perfection as an organized <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, with a distinctive habit, a definite rule, and a declared <em>ethos</em> or spirit, is due to the genius of the children of St. Dominic. They took up the work of St. Francis, and, with their characteristic <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of order and systematic arrangement, brought it into something compact and symmetrical. From them this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of subjection to a First Order was taken up by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and has been adopted by all subsequent Third Orders.
<h3>Spirit</h3>

<p>Primarily the work of the Third Order and its definite spirit may be summed up by saying that it was established first to help in reform of church discipline. Its initial purpose was the preaching of penance; but under <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> influences it rather leaned to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> aspect of the Faith and based its message to the world on the exposition of the Creed; it was to reform church discipline by the more wide-spread <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Secondly, to defend the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Originally this was a military necessity, demanding physical force with which to restrain equally material opposition. Thirdly, to develop the communion of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> ideal of <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">Christ's Mystical Body</a> which has captivated all spiritual-minded people implies a harmony of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. To achieve this end the contemplative and monastic orders were begun; and the Third <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a> endeavours to link <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to this great throng of religious (Proctor, "The Dominican Tertiary's Daily Manual", London, 1900, 15-20).

<p>Only for one period in its history was there any real fear of suppression. Many held that the condemnation passed on the <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beguines and Beghards</a> at the Council of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1312 applied no less to the Orders of Penance. In consequence the master-general petitioned <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a> in 1326 to settle definitely the difficulty. As a result he answered by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 1 June, 1326 (Cum de Mulieribus), which is a long eulogium on the work of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Third Order. After the plague of 1348, a great deal of laxity and disorganization crept into the Third Order, but a wonderful throng of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> soon caused its rejuvenation. The influence of <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a> gave a powerful impetus to the movement in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and her work was carried on by Bl. Clara Gambacorta (d. 1419) and Bl. Maria Mancini (d. 1431). This new spiritual vigour reached across the Alps to the sisterhoods of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, where the effect was almost abnormal (Heimbucher, "Die Orden und Kongregationen der katholischen Kirche", <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, 1907, II, 169-177). But there has never been any reform in the sense of a separate organization with a change of rule or habit. As in the First Order, there has been a peculiar gift of unity which has enabled it to last undivided for seven hundred years.
<h3>Divisions</h3>

<p>The Third Order as it exists today can be divided into two categories: regular, i.e. comprising Tertiaries, whether men or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who live in community and wear the habit externally; and secular, i.e. whether married or single, cleric or lay, who live their lives like others of their profession, but who privately take up practices of austerity, recite some <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> Office, and wear some symbol of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> habit. The origin of the conventual <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> Tertiaries has never been very clearly worked out. It is usual to trace them back to Bl. Emily Bicchieri, about the year 1255 ("Manual of Third Order of St. Dominic", London, 1871, 9). But if the view taken above of the origin of the Third Order in the Ordo de Poenitentia be correct, we are forced to the conclusion that the communities of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> established by St. Dominic at Prouille, S. Sisto, etc. were really of this Third Order. Their constitutions, approved first for S. Sisto, though previously observed at Prouille, expressly speak of the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> as "de Poenitentia S. Mariae Magdalenae" ("Analecta Ord. Praed.", Rome, 1898, 628 sqq.). It would seem then that the Ordo de Poenitentia did not exclude <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of enclosed <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> from its ranks, and this was due probably to St. Dominic himself. Very much later came a conventual order of men, originated by the genius of <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">P&egrave;re Lacordaire</a>. He considered that the democratic spirit of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> fitted it especially for the task of training the youth. But he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how impossible it was for his preaching associates to tie themselves down to schoolwork among boys; as a consequence, he began, in 1852, a Third Order of men, wearing the habit, living in community yet without the burdens of monastic life. The rule was approved provisionally in 1853 and definitely in 1868 (for the rule cf. "Acta Capituli Generalis Ord. Praed.", Rome, 1904, 106 sqq.). But by far the greatest portion of the Third Order consists of secular Tertiaries. These are of every rank of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, and represent the old Ordo de Poenitentia and the old Militia. In certain countries they are grouped into chapters, having a lay prior and sub-prior or <a href="../cathen/12428a.htm">prioress</a> and sub-prioress, and hold monthly meetings. Since the Rule of Mu&ntilde;on de Zamora (1285), they have always been subject to a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> appointed by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> provincial. For the actual reception of the habit, the master-general can give faculties to any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. The full habit is the same as that of the members of the First and Second Orders, but without the <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> (granted, however, to communities since 1667). Though the habit is not worn during life many procure it so that they may be buried in the recognized dress of St. Dominic's children.
<h3>Extent</h3>

<p>It is practically impossible to obtain, even in a vague way, the number of the secular <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Tertiaries. No general register is kept, and the records of each <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> would have to be searched. From the time of St. Louis &mdash; who wished to join the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Orders (Acta Sanctorum, August, V, 545), and is represented in old illuminations, sometimes in the habit of one, sometimes in the habit of the other (Chapotin, "Histoire de dominicains de la provincede France", <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, 1898, p. 497), but probably never joined either&mdash;to our own time, it can be stated only that with the rise and fall of the First Order's greatness rose and fell the number of the Tertiaries. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> during the thirteenth century very many are said to have become Tertiaries. But of this nothing for certain can be specified. At the time of St. Catharine of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> and the Mantellate (women secular Tertiaries) made difficulties about receiving her to the habit as they included at the date only <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> (Gardner, "St. Catherine of Siena", London, 1907, II), and there were no men at all in the Third Order in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> at that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> (Acta Sanctorum, April, III, 1881). Under Bl. Raymund of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, her confessor and, after her death, twenty-third master general, attempts were made to re-establish the order and no doubt much was done (Mortier, "Ma&icirc;tres g&eacute;n&eacute;raux", III, 605-606). But by the time of <a href="../cathen/01585b.htm">St. Antoninus</a> (d. 1450) the numbers had again dwindled down to insignificance ("Summa Moralis", <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, 1750, III, 23, 5, 5, pp. 1291-2). Just previous to the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> there are a few isolated notices; thus <a href="../cathen/06146b.htm">Bl. Adrian Fortescue</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, notes in his diary: "Given to the Black Friars of Oxford to be in their fraternity 12d" ("Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII", London, 1883, Rolls Series, VII, 101). But these give us no ground at all for any surmise as to statistics. In America the first <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> saint (<a href="../cathen/13192c.htm">St. Rose of Lima</a>, d. 1617) and the first <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> (Bl. Martin Porres, d. 1639) were both <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Tertiaries, and later in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> were men like <a href="../cathen/11240d.htm">M. Olier</a> and Bl. Grignon de Montfort.

<p>Then came the influence of <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a>, from whose time there dates a new enthusiasm in the Third Order ("Ann&eacute;e Dominicaine", Paris, 1910, 149-65). Of the regular Tertiaries it is easier to speak more definitely. The numbers of all the sixteen approved congregations existing in 1902 are given, and they amount to some 7000 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> ("Analecta Ord. Praed.", Rome, 1902, 389). To these must be added another 7000 of congregations not yet definitively authorized by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. But every year fresh <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> are opened and the numbers continually increase. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> they began under <a href="../cathen/07118a.htm">Mother Margaret Hallahan</a> (d. 1868) in 1842, and now in all the separate groupings there are 22 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> with some 500 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> their success has been remarkable. Founded in 1846 by Mother Amalie Barth (d. 1895), the congregation in 1902 included 34 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and over 2000 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. In 1876 they passed into <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, where they are rapidly increasing. In <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> they have many establishments, especially for <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> purposes, for their work is as varied as the needs of humanity require. Some are enclosed, others teach, visit the sick, nurse the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, look after old people, take care of penitent girls, work among the poor in the slums, etc. As for the congregation of teaching men, they have been greatly disorganized since their expulsion from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. At present they comprise but a half-dozen colleges in Fribourg, San Sebastian, and South America, and do not amount to more than 100 members in all. Finally, a citation from Faber's "Blessed Sacrament" (2nd ed., p. 565) may be made: "Those who are conversant with, indeed who find the strength and consolation of their lives in, the Acts of the Saints well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there is not a nook in the mystical <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Paradise</a> of our heavenly spouse where the flowers grow thicker or smell more fragrantly than this order of multitudinous child-like <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Nowhere in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does the Incarnate Word show His delight at being with the children of men in more touching simplicity, with more unearthly sweetness, or more spouse-like familiarity than in this, the youngest <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of S. Dominic."

<h2 id="vi">Third Order of St. Francis (regular and secular; male and female)</h2>

<p>A branch of the great <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan family</a>. We deal here: A. with the secular Third Order; B. with the regular.
<h3 id="A">Origin, development, and present state of the secular Third Order</h3>

<p>It has been believed for some time that the Third Order of St. Francis was the oldest of all Third Orders, but historical evidence is against such an opinion. For, besides similar institutions in some monastic orders in the twelfth century, we find, before the foundation of St. Francis, a Third Order, properly so called, among the <a href="../cathen/07543a.htm">Humiliati</a>, confirmed together with its rule by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> in 1201 (see text in <a href="../cathen/14738b.htm">Tiraboschi</a>, "Vetera Humiliatorum monumenta", II, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 1767, 128). But if the Third Order of St. Francis was not the first of its kind, it was, and still is, undoubtedly the best known and most widely distributed and has the greatest influence. About its origin there are two opposite opinions. According to Karl M&uuml;ller, Mandonnet, and others, the Secular Third Order is a survival of the original ideal of St. Francis, viz. a lay-confraternity of penitents, from which, through the influence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the First and Second Orders of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a> have been detached. According to others, St. Francis merely lent his name to pre-existing penitential lay-confraternities, without having any special connection with or influence on them. The two opinions are equally at variance with the best texts we have on the subject, such as <a href="../cathen/14694a.htm">Thomas of Celano</a>, "Vita prima", I, 15; Julian of Spires, "Office of St. Francis: Third Antiphon at <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a>"; <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 7 June, 1230 (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. Franc., I, 65); <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, "Leg. Maior", IV, 6; <a href="../cathen/02498a.htm">Bernard of Besse</a>, in "Anal. Franc.", III, 686. According to these sources, St. Francis really founded a Third Order and gave it a Rule. If we complete these notices with some early <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bulls</a> bearing on the penitential movement and with the account given by Mariano of Florence (end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth century) we can state what follows:

<p>The preaching of St. Francis, as well as his own living example and that of his first disciples, exercised such a powerful attraction on the people that many married men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> wanted to join the First or the Second Order. This being incompatible with their state of life, St. Francis found a middle way: he gave them a rule animated by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> spirit. In the composition of this rule St. Francis was assisted by his friend Cardinal Ugolino, later <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>. As to the place where the Third Order was first introduced nothing certain is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Of late however the preponderance of opinion is for Florence, chiefly on the authority of Mariano of Florence, or <a href="../cathen/05751b.htm">Faenza</a>, for which the first <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> (Potthast, "Regesta Pontificum", 6736) known on the subject is given, whilst the "Fioretti" (ch. xvi), though not regarded as an historical authority, assigns Cannara, a small town two hours' walk from Portiuncula, as the birthplace of the Third Order. Mariano and the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> for <a href="../cathen/05751b.htm">Faenza</a> (16 Dec., 1221) point to 1221 as the earliest date of the institution of the Third Order, and in fact, besides these and other sources, the oldest preserved rule bears this date at its head. This rule was published by P. Sabatier and H. Boehmer (see bibliography), and contained originally twelve chapters, to which at the time of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> (1227) a thirteenth was added. It prescribes simplicity in dress (1), considerable <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and abstinence (2-3), the canonical office or other <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> instead (4-5), confession and communion thrice a year, and forbids carrying arms or taking solemn <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a> without necessity (6); every month the brothers and sisters have to assemble in a church designated by the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, and a religious has to give them an instruction (7); they also exercise the <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a> with their brothers (8); whenever a member dies the whole confraternity has to be present at the funeral and to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the departed (9); everyone has to make his last will three months after his reception; dissensions among brothers and sisters or other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are to be settled peaceably; if any troubles arise with local authorities the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> ought to act with the counsel of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (10). No <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> or anyone suspected of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> can be received, and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> only with the consent of their husbands (11); the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> have to denounce shortcomings to the visitor, who will punish the culprits; every year two new <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> and a treasurer are to be elected; no point of the rule obliges under pain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (12). On account of the prohibition of arms and unnecessary <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a>, the followers of this rule came into conflict with local authorities, a fact of which we have evidence in many <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bulls</a> all through the thirteenth century, issued to safeguard the privileges of the Tertiaries (see list of these <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> in Mandonnet, "Les R&egrave;gles", 146-47).

<p>Wadding ("Annales Min." ad a. 1321, n. 13) gives another longer redaction of the rule, which is almost identical with the one solemnly confirmed by <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a> through the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Supra montem", 17 Aug., 1289. This last form has for long been considered as the work of St. Francis, whilst Karl M&uuml;ller denied any connection of St. Francis with it. If we compare the rule published and approved by <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a> with the oldest text of 1221, we see that they substantially agree, slight modifications and different dispositions of chapters (here 20 in number) excepted. Through a most interesting text published by Golubovich (Arch. Franc. Hist., II, 1909, 20) we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> now that this Rule of <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a> was approved on the petition of some Italian Tertiaries. Another recent publication by Guerrini (Arch. Franc. Hist., I, 1908, 544 sq.) proves that there existed in the thirteenth century Third Order Confraternities with quite different rules. On the whole, it can safely be affirmed that until <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a> there was no Rule of the Third Order generally observed, but besides the one quoted above, and probably the most widely spread, there were others of more local character. The same might be said as to the government of the confraternities. Besides their own officials, they had to have a visitor, who seems to have been usually appointed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In 1247 <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> ordered that the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> were to assume the direction of the Tertiaries in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> Franc., I, 464), but about twenty years later when St. Bonaventure wrote his question: "Why do not the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> promote the Order of 'Penitents'?" (Op. om., VIII, 368) the contrary had practically prevailed. <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a> introduced unity of rule and of direction into the Third Order, which henceforward was entrusted to the care of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>.

<p>If we except a few points, bearing especially on <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> and abstinence, mitigated by <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> in 1526 and <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> in 1547, the Rule as given by <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a> remained in vigour till 1883, when <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, himself a tertiary, through the <a href="../cathen/01636a.htm">Apostolic Constitution</a> "Misericors Dei Filius", modified the text, adapting it more to the modern state and needs of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. All substantial points, however, remained; only the daily vocal <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were reduced, as also the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> and abstinences, whilst the former statute of confession and communion thrice a year was changed into monthly communion. Other points of the modified Rule of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> are of great social and religious importance, such as the prohibition of pomp in dressing, of frequenting theatres of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> character, and keeping and reading papers and books at variance with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. The direction is entrusted to the three branches of the First Order: <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>, <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, and to the Regular Third Order. By delegation, confraternities can be established and directed by any <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Those who for serious reasons cannot join a confraternity may be received as single tertiaries. Finally, great spiritual privileges are granted to all members of the Third Order.

<p>The beneficent influence of the secular Third Order of St. Francis cannot be highly enough appreciated. Through the prohibition against carrying arms a deadly blow was given to the <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> system and to the ever-fighting factions of Italian municipalities; through the admission of poor and rich, nobles and common people, the social classes were brought nearer each other. How far the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> ideal of St. Francis was carried out by the secular Third Order we may judge from the great number (about 75) of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and blessed of every condition it produced. It may suffice to mention: <a href="../cathen/05389a.htm">St. Elizabeth of Hungary</a>; St. Louis, King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; St. Ferdinand, King of Castile; <a href="../cathen/05391a.htm">St. Elizabeth of Portugal</a>; St. Rosa of <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>; <a href="../cathen/09653b.htm">St. Margaret of Cortona</a>; Bl. Umiliana Cerchi; <a href="../cathen/01482a.htm">Bl. Angela of Foligno</a>; Bl. Raymond Lullus; Bl. Luchesius of Poggibonsi, who passes as the first tertiary received by St. Francis; <a href="../cathen/08256b.htm">St. Ivo</a>; and in our times, <a href="../cathen/08326c.htm">Bl. Jean-Baptiste Vianney</a>, the cur&eacute; of Ars; of names celebrated in history for literature, arts, politics, inventions, etc., <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>, <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a>, <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a>, Cola di Rienzo, <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a>, <a href="../cathen/06374a.htm">Vasco da Gama</a>, Cervantes, Lope de Vega, <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">Thomas More</a>, Galvani, <a href="../cathen/15503a.htm">Volta</a>, <a href="../cathen/06379b.htm">Garc&iacute;a Moreno</a>, <a href="../cathen/09285b.htm">Liszt</a>, and, finally, <a href="../cathen/06318a.htm">Lady Georgiana Fullerton</a>. Popes <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> and <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> were members of the Third Order, as also is <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pope Pius X</a>. Since the adaptation of the rugby <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> the Third Order has grown more active than ever. At present the total number of members is esteemed about two and a half millions, spread all over the world. National and local congresses have been held in different countries: seven in the period from 1894 to 1908 in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, others in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, some in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the first general congress in Assisi (1895), many local ones from 1909 to 1911; others have been held in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, the last one at <a href="../cathen/13460a.htm">Santiago</a> in 1909; in <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentina</a> the last one at <a href="../cathen/03035a.htm">Buenos Aires</a> in 1906; in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, in the last two instances in connection with general congresses of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. There exist almost in all civilized languages numerous monthly periodicals which, whilst keeping up the union amongst the different confraternities, serve also for the instruction and edification of its members. The "Acta Ordinis Frat. Min.", XXVI, Quaracchi, 1907, 255-58, gives the names of 122 such periodicals. French periodicals are indicated by P. B. Ginnet, O.F.M., "Le Tiers Ordre et le Pr&ecirc;tre", Vanves, 1911, p. 51 sq.; German periodicals by Moll, O.M. Cap., "Wegweiser in die Literatur des Dritten Ordens", Ratisbon, 1911. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> even a regular newspaper was founded, "Rinascita Francescana", Bologna, 1910; another in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, "Allgemeine deutsche Tertiaren-Zeitung", Wiesbaden, 1911.&mdash;We may mention also the special organs for directors of the Third Order, e.g. "Der Ordensdirektor", published at <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a> by the Tyrolese <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, "Revue sacerdotale du Tiers-Ordre de Saint Fran&ccedil;ois", published by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>. Both reviews appear once every two months.
<h3 id="B">Third Order Regular (male and female)</h3>

<p><em>(1) Its origin and general development till Leo X</em>

<p>The origin of the Regular Third Order, both male and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a>, can be traced back to the second half of the thirteenth century, but no precise date can be indicated. It was organized, in different forms, in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, in the south of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Probably some secular tertiaries, who in many cases had their house of meeting, gradually withdrew entirely from the world and so formed <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, but without the three substantial <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. Other religious associations such as the <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beguines</a> (women) and <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beghards</a> (men) in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, sometimes passed over to the Third Order, as has been clearly shown from recent study. Towards the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of the fourteenth century some suspicion of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> opinions fell on some of these free religious unions of the Third Order (<em>bizocchi</em>), as we can infer from the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> "Sancta Romana", Dec., 1317 (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. Franc., V, 134). More than a century later <a href="../cathen/08452a.htm">St. John of Capistran</a> (1456) had to defend the Tertiaries in a special treatise: "Defensorium tertii ordinis d. Francisci", printed with other minor works of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> in 1580. Throughout the fourteenth century the regular tertiaries of both sexes had in the most cases no common organization; only in the following century we can observe single well-ordered <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities with solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and a common head. <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> submitted in 1428 all tertiaries, regular and secular, to the direction of the Minister-General of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. Franc., VII, 715), but this disposition was soon revoked by his successor <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>. We meet thus in the same fifteenth century with numerous independent male congregations of regular tertiaries with the three <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. Contemporaneously there existed sister congregations of the Third Order with solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, for instance, the Grey sisters of the Third Order, serving in <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, spread in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, whose remarkable <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of 1483 have recently been published by H. Lemartre in "Arch. Franc. Hist." IV, 1911, 713-31, and the congregation still existing founded at <a href="../cathen/06124b.htm">Foligno</a> in 1397 by Blessed Angelina of Marsciano (1435). <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, in order to introduce uniformity into the numerous congregations, gave in 1521 a new form to the rule, now in ten chapters, retaining of the rule as published by <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a> all that could serve the purpose, adding new points, especially the three solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and insisting on subjection to the First Order of St. Francis. For this last disposition the Rule of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> met with resistance, and never was accepted by some congregations, whilst it serves till the present day as the basis of the constitutions of many later congregations, especially of numerous communities of sisters.

<p><em>(2) Single congregations after Leo X, of women</em>

<p>The two Italian congregations, the Lombardic and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilian</a>, which had constituted themselves in the course of the fifteenth century, were united by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, and since <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> enjoyed entire independence from the First Order. It had then already 11 provinces. In the seventeenth century the congregations of <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> (of Zeppern) were united with the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. In 1734 <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a> confirmed their <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>. Whilst the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> swept away all similar congregations, the Italian survived with four provinces, of which one was in <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>. In 1906 a small congregation of Tertiary <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> in the Balearic Islands and a little later two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> with colleges in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> joined the same congregation, which in 1908 numbered about 360 members. The dress is that of the <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a>, from whom they can hardly be distinguished. The residence of the minister-general is at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, near the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Sts. Cosmas and Damian. After the time of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> the Spanish congregation often had troubles on the question of its submission to the First Order. After <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> (1568) had put the whole Third Order again under the care of the Minister-General of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>, the superiors of the three provinces constituted in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> could, after 1625, partake at the General Chapters of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> and since 1670 they have had even a definitor-general to represent them. The French congregation, named from their house at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> "of Picpus", was reformed by V. Mussart (d. 1637), and maintained close ties with the First Order till its extinction in the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. A well-known member of this congregation is <a href="../cathen/07214a.htm">Hyppolit H&eacute;lyot</a>, the author of an important history of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. In 1768 it had four provinces with 61 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and 494 religious. Other congregations of Tertiaries existed after the fifteenth century in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. They perished either at the time of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> or in the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. We may mention also the <a href="../cathen/11193b.htm">Obregonians</a>, the "Bons-Fils" in northern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> founded in 1615, and the "Penitents gris" at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> after the sixteenth century, all now extinct. In the nineteenth century some new congregations arose, e.g. the Poor Brothers of St. Francis, the Brothers of St. Francis at Waldbreitbach (Rhine) after 1860, the "Frati bigi", founded in 1884 at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> by Ludovic of Casoria, O.F.M. The most of these modern tertiary communities consist only of <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> and depend on their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p><em>(3) Congregation of Sisters</em>

<p>Whilst <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> in the reform of the rule had left it free to the congregations to adopt <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> enclosure or not, <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> (1568) prescribed it to all <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of tertiary sisters with solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. Still this order was not carried out everywhere. In this regard the custom prevailed that the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> refused to take the direction of those <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> which had only episcopal enclosure. Besides those already mentioned above, we may add the different offshoots of the <a href="../cathen/05388a.htm">Sisters of St. Elizabeth</a> in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (there, under the name of Soeurs du Refuge, some of them still exist). The first <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, also, founded by <a href="../cathen/08481a.htm">St. Angela Merici</a> (1540), belonged to the Third Order.

<p>In the nineteenth century many of the new congregations adopted the Rule of the Third Order, but most of them have no further connection with the First Order. Many of them have widely varying names; a good many are of mere local character, others again are of international importance. As to their activities, almost all dedicate themselves to <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>, either in <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, homes, or ateliers; others work in <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, not a few are in foreign missions. We can give here scarcely more than a list of the names, with the dates of the foundation. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> there are the Poor Sisters of St. Francis, founded 1845 (1851) by M.

In <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> there are the Congregations of Rosendaal, of <a href="../cathen/02752a.htm">Breda</a>, of Heythuizen, all of which have communities in foreign missions; lastly the Congregation of Heerlen.

In <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> there once existed many congregations of the Third Order, and even now there are several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of strict enclosure. Of the active congregations the most noteworthy are the two founded by the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/14578a.htm">Theodosius Florentini</a>, viz. the <a href="../cathen/07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a> for <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with mother-house at Menzingen (1844), with numerous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> outside <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a> for <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> work (1852), with mother-house at Ingenbohl.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, before the last suppression of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, there were about fifty communities of the Third Order; the most important was that of the Missionaries of Mary, founded by Mother de Chapotin de Neuville (d.1904) in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, with actual mother-house at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, with communities spread all over the world.

On the whole, the sisters professing the Rule of the Third Order amount at least to 50,000.

<p>The Regular Third Order produced one saint, Hyacintha of Mariscotti, and five Blessed: Lucia of Callagirone, <a href="../cathen/05391b.htm">Elizabeth of Reute</a>, Angelina of Marsciomo, Jeremias Lambertenghi and Crescentia Hoss of Kaufbeuren.

<h2 id="vii">Third Order of St. Francis, in Canada</h2>

<p>The Third Order of St. Francis was established by the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> Recollects at Quebec in 1671, and some years later at <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a> and <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. Considering the population of the country, it was in a flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>. In 1681 a Recollect notes that "many <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> people of Quebec belong to the Third Order". After the cession of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the Third Order, deprived of its directors, the Recollects, seemed to have disappeared gradually, only to flourish anew thirty years after the death at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, 1813, of the last Recollect <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. The Third Order was re-established about 1840 by Mgr Ignatius Bourget, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. Fervent fellow-labourers helped the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> to spread the Third Order in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, notably Canon J.A. Par&eacute; and the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> C. E. Gilbert and A. Giband. Mgr Bourget established a fraternity of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, 6 May, 1863, and one of men, 13 June, 1866; both were directed by the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> till 1874, by Canon P. E. Dufresne from 1874 till 1881, by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> from 1881 till 1888, and by the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> from 1888 till 1890; since then by the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>. Mgr Fabre, successor to Bishop Bourget, in a letter (3 Sept., 1882) to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and faithful of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, says: "We have in our midst the tertiaries of St. Francis, who are known to you all by the edification they give, and by the good odour of all the virtues which they practise in the world." The Third Order was reintroduced at Quebec almost at the same time as at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. On 19 Nov., 1859, Father Flavian Durocher, O.M.I., received the profession of two <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, after a year's <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. These were joined by others, until in 1876 Quebec possessed over 2000 tertiaries, while in the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a> several <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> had groups of tertiaries. Among <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the spread of the Third Order at this epoch we must name, besides the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> priests: Father Durocher, St. Sauveur, Quebec; L. N. Begin, now <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Quebec; James Sexton, Quebec; Oliver Caron, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a>; E. H. Guilbert, <a href="../cathen/12505a.htm">L. Provancher</a>, and G. Fraser, all three of the Quebec diocese. <a href="../cathen/12505a.htm">Father Provancher</a> was one of the most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a>. In 1866, having received faculties from the General of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>, he established a very fervent fraternity in his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Portneuf. He propagated the Third Order by his writings. For two years he edited a review, in which he published nearly every month an article on the Third Order, or answered questions appertaining thereto. At that epoch (1876) the brothers' fraternity at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> counted 137 members; the sisters, a still greater number. At <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a> the tertiaries were less numerous&mdash;enough, however, to form a fraternity a little later. Quebec with its 200 tertiaries did not have a fraternity till 1882.

<p>In 1881 the arrival in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> of Father Frederic of Ghyvelde gave new spirit to the Third Order. He spent eight months in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and worked actively for the Third Order. He began at Quebec, where he held the Holy Visit prescribed by the rule and admitted 100 new members. At <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a> he found "a numerous and fervent fraternity". His visit to the fraternities of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> was followed by a notable increase in membership. Shortly afterwards <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> published his Encyclicals on the Third Order. The <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, in obedience to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> wishes, recommended the Third Order to their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and faithful. But the Friars of the First Order alone could give the Third a fitting development; hence, when Father Frederic returned in 1888, several <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, among them Bishop Lafl&egrave;che of <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a> and <a href="../cathen/14462b.htm">Archbishop Taschereau</a>, welcomed him as its promoter. The foundation of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> in 1890 inaugurated a new era of prosperity for the Third Order. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> took over the direction of the Third Order at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. The fraternities of other districts were visited regularly, and new ones were formed. The Third Order has since spread rapidly. Today the Third Order in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> numbers nearly 200 fraternities with over 50,000 members, under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> have a small number of fraternities. The <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> have also the direction of 20 fraternities with 5000 members in the Franco-Canadian centres of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. All these large numbers of isolated tertiaries give a total of nearly 60,000. These tertiaries are mostly <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a>. There are very few fraternities for English-speaking tertiaries; of these there are two very flourishing ones at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. It is in the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a> that the Third Order is most flourishing. Three monthly reviews, treating specially of the Third Order, are published in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>: (1) "La Revue du Tiers Ordre", founded in 1884 by the tertiaries of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, and directed since 1891 by the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> of that city; (2) "The Franciscan Review and St. Anthony's Record", founded in 1905 by the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>; (3) "L'Echo de St. Fran&ccedil;ois", published since 1911 by the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> of Ottawa. The principal social works of the Third Order in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> are: three houses of the Third Order in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> and one in Quebec, directed by lady tertiaries; a lodging-house and an industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, directed also by lady tertiaries; several work-rooms for the benefit of the poor; and public <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>, one in Quebec and two in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>.

<p>The Third Order Regular is represented in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> by three flourishing institutions: A. Little <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters of Mary, founded at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, in 1889 and transferred to Baie-St-Paul, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, in 1891; their constitutions were approved in 1903. They follow the Rule of the Third Order Regular. Their habit comprises a brown tunic and <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a>, a white hood and wimple, and a white woollen cord; they wear a silver crucifix. Work.&mdash;Assistance of the sick, the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, the aged, of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> and instruction of the young&mdash;in a word, all the works of mercy. Development.&mdash;This congregation possesses 8 houses, nearly all in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The mother house is at Baie-St-Paul, <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. The institution numbers 150 professed sisters, 7 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, 30 <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a>, and 8 associates.

<p>B. <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> missionaries of Mary, founded in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and following the Rule of the Third Order Regular. They have six houses in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>: (1) Quebec, founded 1892; <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, perpetual adoration, printing, <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a>, workshop, house of probation for aspirants, patronage, visiting the sick. (2) St. Anne of Beaupr&eacute; (1894); patronage, workshop, hospitality for <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, visiting the sick. (3) <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>, Manitoba (1897); boarding-school, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, dispensary, visiting the sick. (4) Pine Creek, Manitoba (1899); <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, model farm, dispensary, visiting the sick. (5) St. Malo, Quebec (1902); day nursery, primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of domestic economy, dispensary, pharmacy, visiting the sick. (6) Winnipeg (1909); day nursery, <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a>, patronage, visiting the poor and the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. These houses possess 150 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> included. Since its establishment in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, the congregation has had 290 <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> members, many of whom are now engaged in mission work in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>, <a href="../cathen/04228a.htm">Congo</a>, <a href="../cathen/15766b.htm">Zululand</a>, Natal, <a href="../cathen/10610a.htm">Mozambique</a>, <a href="../cathen/09509e.htm">Madagascar</a>, and South America. The mother-house of Quebec has founded six others in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>: Woonsocket in 1904; New York and New Bedford in 1906; <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> in 1907; Providence in 1909; Fall River in 1910.

<p>C. Religious of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>, founded at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in 1838. Their object is the care of the sick and of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the young. They were introduced into <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> in 1904, and have at present 5 houses, comprising a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, a boarding-school for girls, and model and elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.

<h2 id="viii">Third Order of St. Francis in Great Britain and Ireland</h2>
<h3 id="A">In Great Britain</h3>

<p>The Third Order Secular comprises ninety-six congregations of which forty are under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> of the Leonine Union and fifty-four under that of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a>, and about 12,000 members, amongst whom are several <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, a number of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> of all ranks. In their organization the British tertiary congregations follow the common rule, but many of them add some corporal works of mercy, reclaiming negligent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and so forth. All the tertiaries are governed by a commissary-provincial appointed by the minister-provincial of the first order. His <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> is to grant the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> faculties to directors of congregations, to hold visitations, and generally supervise the affairs of the Third Order under his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. A national conference of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> tertiaries with a view to strengthening and consolidating the order, was held in 1898 at <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a> in the hall attached to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> church, and was presided over by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The opening address was delivered by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. A second national conference was held at <a href="../cathen/09112a.htm">Leeds</a>. Since the institution of the English national <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> congress, in 1910, the tertiaries have taken part in these and have had their sectional meeting in the congress.

<p>Of the Third Order in Great Britain in pre-Reformation days little is known. It is, however, certain that there existed in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> several houses of Sisters of the Third Order Regular. <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">Blessed Thomas More</a> is frequently spoken of as a tertiary of St. Francis, but there seems to be no historical evidence to support this statement. The Third Order, however, was known in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in the penal days. Fr. William Staney, the first commissary of the order in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> after the Dissolution, wrote "A Treatise of the Third Order of St. Francis" (Douai, 1617). An interesting fact in connection with the Third Order in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> is the appointment in 1857, as commissary-general, of <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Dr. (afterwards Cardinal) Manning</a>, by a letter patent, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 10 April, 1857, given by the minister-general of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin Friars Minor</a>, empowering him to act as "Superior, visitor and Our Commissary of each and all the brothers and sisters of the Third Order Secular dwelling in England". Amongst notable English tertiaries of modern times, besides <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning</a>, may be mentioned <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a>, Lady Herbert of Lea, the late Earl of Denbigh, and the poet <a href="../cathen/11546a.htm">Coventry Patmore</a>. The Third Order Regular is represented in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> by nineteen <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of sisters and in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> by six <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>. There are no communities of brothers. These <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> belong to various congregations, most of which are of English institution. They devote themselves either to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> or to <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> works of mercy or to the foreign missions. Most notable historically amongst these congregations are the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> at Taunton and Woodchester, which represent the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Third Order established at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, in 1621. Their founder was <a href="../cathen/06418a.htm">Father Gennings</a>, the brother of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> <a href="../cathen/06418a.htm">Edmund Gennings.</a> This was, in fact, the first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Third Order Regular, enclosed, founded for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. The community later on migrated to <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> where it remained until 1794, when, owing to the troubles caused by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, it crossed over into <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and, after eleven years' residence at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, settled finally at Taunton in Somerset. The congregation was under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> until 1837 when, owing to the dissolution of the Recollect province, it came under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In 1860 a second foundation was made at Woodchester.
<h3 id="B">In Ireland</h3>

<p>The congregations of the Third Order Secular in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> are almost exclusively attached to churches of the First Order. Under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> of the Leonine Union are fourteen congregations with 9741 members, and subject to the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin Friars Minor</a> are four congregations with 5100 members. The Third Order Regular comprises two houses of brothers at Clara and Farragher, and eleven in the <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Archdiocese of Tuam</a>, all devoted to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work. At Drumshambo the sisters of the order have a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> where perpetual adoration is maintained day and night. There is also one <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Missionary Sisters of Mary.

<h2 id="x">Province of the Sacred Heart of Jesus</h2>

<p>Prior to 1906 several communities of the Third Order existed in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> all lay institutes dedicated to teaching and other <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>. Amongst these were three branches of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Brothers: at <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, New York; at Loretto, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>; and at Spalding, Nebraska. The communities at Loretto and Brooklyn were founded more than half a century ago from Mount Bellew Monastery, <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Archdiocese of Tuam</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; Spalding Institute was a branch of the Brooklyn community. In 1905 Brother Linus Lynch, then superior of the institute, asked the <a href="../cathen/11284b.htm">ordinary</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> for permission to have some of his subjects <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. This request the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> refused, as the community had been introduced into the diocese for the care of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and he feared that in the event of its members becoming <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> this work would suffer. A petition was then sent to the minister-general, Rt. Rev. Angelus de Mattia, asking for union with the third Order Regular; as this union could not be effected, some of the community determined to ask for a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> in order to enter the institute. In 1907 fifteen were dispensed; these, together with eleven <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, went to Spalding, <a href="../cathen/10729b.htm">Nebraska</a>, where a small community of brothers had been united to the order in 1906. They were received by Very Rev. Dr. Stanislaus Dujmoric, commissary-general, and by <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> from the ordinary year of probation they made the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of the order. A college was then opened at Spalding, giving the order its first house in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.

<p>In 1908 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> community of Franciscan Brothers at Loretto, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, were admitted to <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">solemn profession</a>, and eight young men were received into the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>.

<p>In 1910-11 Rt. Rev. Eugene A. Garvey, D.D., <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01368a.htm">Altoona</a>, requested the fathers to take charge of the Italian Church of St. <a href="../cathen/01556a.htm">Anthony of Padua</a> at Johnstown, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, <a href="../cathen/01368a.htm">Altoona</a>, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. The four houses in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> were erected into a province, 24 Sept., 1910, Very Rev. Dr. Jerome Zazzara being elected provincial. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> has since given the fathers charge of Sts. Peter and Paul's <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> Church in that city, and a new college is to be opened at <a href="../cathen/14016a.htm">Sioux City, Iowa</a>, in 1912. The provincial mother-house is at St. Francis's College, Loretto, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. The American Province has now five <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, two colleges, sixty-five professed members, and twenty <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> and <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a>.

<h2 id="xi">The Third Order Secular of St. Francis</h2>

<p>Established in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> by the early <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> missionaries for the white settlers and soldiers and Indian converts, especially in the Southern States. A confraternity existed at <a href="../cathen/13457a.htm">Santa Fe</a> long before 1680. Another confraternity existed in <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a> almost from the time of the reconquest (1692-1695). The document stating this fact is a report of the Father custos, Jos&eacute; Bernal, dated Santa Fe, 17 Sept., 1794. There is no documentary evidence of the existence of a Third Order for lay people as a regularly organized confraternity anywhere else, though we learn from documents that single <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> were termed tertiaries among the Indians. It is most probable, however, that a confraternity existed at St. Augustine, <a href="../cathen/06115b.htm">Florida</a>, before the close of the sixteenth century, and at <a href="../cathen/13424b.htm">San Antonio</a>, <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>, before the middle of the eighteenth century. The establishment of provinces of the order of <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> brought about the establishment of many confraternities. There are at present 186 confraternities of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Tertiaries in this country, with a membership of 35,605. Of these, 142 congregations with 27,805 members are under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>, 32 with 6800 members under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a>, and 12 congregations with 1000 members under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> Conventual. Besides these, there are many hundreds of tertiaries throughout the country not belonging to any congregation.

<h2 id="xii">The Third Order Secular of the Servites</h2>

<p>Established in the United States in 1893. There are at present 2 congregations, with membership of 400.
