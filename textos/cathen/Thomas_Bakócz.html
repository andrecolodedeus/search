<h1>Thomas Bak&oacute;cz</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and statesman, b. about 1442, in the village of Erdoed, county Szatm&aacute;r, Northeastern <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>; d. 15 June, 1521. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> belonged to the lower class, but was raised to the rank of nobility by his older brother Valentine. Through the generosity of this same brother he was enabled to pursue a thorough course of studies first in the town of Szatm&aacute;r-N&eacute;meti, then in <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and finally in the Italian cities of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> and Padua. He returned to his native country about the year 1470, with the doctor's degree, and soon after made the acquaintance of a distinguished ecclesiastic from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Gabriel Rangoni, who enjoyed the confidence of <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">King Matthias</a> (1458-90) and held high positions in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. By this <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> Bak&oacute;cz was introduced to the king about the year 1474; and through a fortunate incident he attracted the attention of his sovereign. He was retained at court, employed in the chancery, and soon became secretary to the king and substitute of the royal chancellor. In 1480 he received a provostship in the town of Titel, Southern <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>; and in 1486 he was promoted to the Bishopric of Raab. After the death of <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">King Matthias</a> in 1490 Bak&oacute;cz took an active part in the selection of a new ruler; and when his candidate, Ladislaus II (1490-1516), a Polish prince and King of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, was chosen, Bak&oacute;cz was made chancellor of the realm. As such he became the real ruler of his country, whose destinies he directed with firmness and skill. He concluded advantageous treaties with other powers, and made the alliance with <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> the pivot of his foreign policy. On that account he kept <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> out of the League of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> formed in 1508 between <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Pope Julius II</a> (1503-13), <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Span, and the Emperor Maximilian (1493-1519) against <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. No wonder that the authorities of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> vied with King Ladislaus in securing honours and riches for the powerful and ambitious <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>.

<p>When the Bishopric of Erlau became <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> in 1491, Bak&oacute;cz was appointed to it by the king. <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Pope Alexander VI</a> (1492-1503) at first opposed, but later ratified, the appointment in 1492; and shortly afterwards, in December of the same year, transferred Back&oacute;cz to the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> See of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>. In addition to this Bak&oacute;cz was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1500, and made <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople in 1507. The republic of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> gladly assigned to him the revenues which were found within its own territory and attached to the patriarchal title. Not satisfied with all this Bak&oacute;cz aspired to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne, and received assurances of support the Emperor Maximilian and from <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>; however, adverse circumstances prevented the realization of these hopes. A man of such prominence had necessarily his part in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> events of a general character. When in 1510 several <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> rebelled against <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Pope Julius II</a>, both sides tried to win him for their plans. Bak&oacute;cz maintained a waiting attitude, until the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in 1511, condemned the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a> and announced that a general synod would be held in the Lateran in 1512. Bak&oacute;cz was invited to this council, and without further hesitation he sailed on a <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> ship to <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, and arrived in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in January, 1512, where he was received by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with much pomp and splendour. In the council, which opened the following May, Bak&oacute;cz took an active part; he was on the committee for the reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>. After the death of <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Pope Julius II</a>, early in 1513, and during the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a>, it became evident that he had little prospect of winning the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a>; in fact on the 10th of March Cardinal Medici was chosen as <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> (1513-21).

<p>The new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> secured at once the service of the influential Bak&oacute;cz for a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. He appointed the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> a <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> <em>a latere</em> not only for <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> but also for the neighbouring countries, and granted to him most ample faculties. After his return to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> in 1514 Bak&oacute;cz made preparations at once for the expedition, and soon an army of about 100,000 soldiers was gathered under the leadership of George Dozsa. Unfortunately the nobles were opposed to the enterprise, and the whole matter ended in a civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between them and the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a>, in which the nobility remained victorious. After the death of King Ladislaus II in 1516 the influence of Bak&oacute;cz ceased almost completely; the last years of his life were spent more in retirement. He was a man of the world, very ambitious, and not always tender in the choice of the means to an end. Out of his large fortune, and through his influential position, hr provided in a princely manner for the members of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Owing to the great power so long wielded by him, he made many enemies among his own countrymen, whose opposition triumphed in the end. With all that his personal conduct was blameless; not even a shadow of suspicion was cast upon his character by his enemies. He was deeply religious, and had a special <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to the Blessed Virgin</a>, in whose <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> he fitted out a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Erlau, and built one near that of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>. In the latter, a magnificent structure of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, his remains found their last resting place.
