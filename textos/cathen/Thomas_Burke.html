<h1>Thomas Burke</h1>  

<p>(THOMAS DE BURGO)</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11342b.htm">Ossory</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, about 1709; d. at Kilkenny, 25 September, 1776. He went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1723 and there was placed under the care of his namesake and kinsman, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Father Thomas Burke, who prepared him for admission into the order. A <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> was obtained from the Sacred Congregation, and on 14 June, 1724, he was clothed with the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> habit before he had attained his fifteenth year. Young Burke showed special aptitude for study and with the permission of the master general was allowed to begin his course during his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. Two years were given to philosophy and five to <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. So marked was his progress in studies and letters that he was singled out, even though yet a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a>, by special marks of affection from <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a>. During the reconstruction of St. Sixtus' in 1727 and 1728, the pontiff visited the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> once a week, taking part in their community exercises, becoming familiar with the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> and especially with Burke. He was gradually promoted to the highest <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> honours of the order, being charged successively with all the official <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> in a regular <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> studium. He held the office of regent of studies for six years. In 1742 the Master General, Thomas Ripoll, personally conferred on him the degree of Master of Theology. The following year he returned to Dublin where he took up the work of the ministry. A general chapter of the order held at Bologna in 1748 passed an ordinance that in all the immediately following provincial chapters a historiographer should be appointed in every province. This order did not reach <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in time for the provincial chapter which was convened the following year at <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, and to which assembly Father Burke had been elected by his brethren as Definitor. At the subsequent chapter, however, of 1753 he was appointed historian of his province. The same <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Definitor was conferred again in 1757.

<p>Father Burke while in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was commissioned by the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, through Bishop MacDonough of <a href="../cathen/08642a.htm">Kilmore</a>, to obtain from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> ten new offices of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. After his return to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, he was entrusted with a similar commission by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, the Most Rev. John Linegar, and the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> for fourteen other feasts of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. The decrees were given respectively 8 July, 1741 and 1 July, 1747. Both original documents are preserved in the archives of St. Clement's, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Father Burke was promoted by <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a> in 1759, to the <a href="../cathen/11342b.htm">See of Ossory</a> which he governed for seventeen years. His talents, learning, culture, and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> fitted him for the pastoral office, united with his noble and fearless character. An accurate portrait of Bishop Burke is possessed by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of Drogheda, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. He is known to posterity more on account of his learned work "Hibernia Dominicana", than by any other claim. The work was nominally published at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, but in reality it came from the press of Edmund Finn of Kilkenny, in 1762. The author gave to it four years of incessant labour, and in 1772 he added a "Supplementum" which was a vindication of <a href="../cathen/13061a.htm">Rinuccini</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> of <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Pope Innocent X</a>, of the charges brought against him by the supreme council of Confederate <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> during his residence in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Question of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance and fear of subverting "that fidelity and submission which we acknowledge ourselves to owe from <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> and from gratitude to his Majesty King George III" caused seven of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Bishops to condemn the "Hibernia Dominicana" and "Supplementum". (For defense of Bishop Burke see Coleman, Ir. Eccl. Record.) "Promptuarium dogmatico canonico morale", a work of the celebrated <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Larrago, enlarged and accommodated to its day by Father Burke, was about to be published in 1753 when his appointment as historian interrupted it.
