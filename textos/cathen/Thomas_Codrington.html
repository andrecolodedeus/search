<h1>Thomas Codrington</h1>  

<p>(Died 1691?), <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> divine, chiefly known for his attempt to introduce into <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the "Institute of Secular Priests Living in Community", founded in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> by <a href="../cathen/07439b.htm">Bartholomaus Holzhauser</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, where he taught humanities for a time. Later on he lived with <a href="../cathen/07502c.htm">Cardinal Howard</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, acting as his <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> and secretary. He returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in July, 1684, and on the accession of James II in the following year, he was appointed one of the royal <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> and preachers in ordinary. While he was in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he had joined the institute above mentioned, in which <a href="../cathen/07502c.htm">Cardinal Howard</a> took a great personal interest, and his return to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> seemed to the superior, Father Hofer, a favourable opportunity for extending the institute. Accordingly Mr. Codrington and his companion, Mr. John Morgan, were appointed procurators to introduce the institute into <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The object of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, the constitutions of which had been approved by <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> in 1680, was to encourage community-life among the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. This was to be attained by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> residing together, and doing their work from a common centre, all being subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In this work he received much assistance from <a href="../cathen/07502c.htm">Cardinal Howard</a>, who addressed letters both to the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> and to the dean of the chapter, exhorting all <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to join the institute. Even before leaving <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he had been active in propagating the institute, and had, with his colleagues, endeavoured not only to introduce it into all the English colleges abroad, but even to make it <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> on the superiors by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>. Some progress was in fact made, but before much could be effected the <a href="../cathen/13007b.htm">Revolution</a> took place, and in 1688 James II fled from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Mr. Codrington followed his patron abroad to Saint-Germain, where he continued to act as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> until his death, which took place about 1691. For some years strenuous efforts were made to spread the institute in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and in 1697 special constitutions, designed to meet the peculiar circumstances of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, were published with a preface, which shows that several of the leading missionaries had joined it. The chapter, however, were unrelenting, on the ground that it was unsuitable in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and would lead to dissentions among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and ultimately Bishop Giffard suppressed it. Mr. Codrington published a sermon preached before the king and queen, 28 November, 1686, and another preached before the queen-dowager, 6 February, 1687. The former of these was republished in the 1741 reprint entitled "Catholic Sermons".
