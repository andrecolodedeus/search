<h1>Thomas D'Arcy McGee</h1>  

<p>An editor, politician, and poet, born at Carlingford, Co. Louth, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 13 April, 1825; assassinated at <a href="../cathen/11352a.htm">Ottawa</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, 7 April, 1868. He was a precocious youth and emigrating to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> at seventeen a speech he made soon after at <a href="../cathen/12509a.htm">Providence</a>, <a href="../cathen/13020a.htm">Rhode Island</a>, on the Repeal of the Union between <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, brought him an offer of employment on the Boston "Pilot". His editorial and other contributions to this paper and public addresses attracted the attention of O'Connell who called them "the inspired utterances of a young exiled <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> boy in America". After this McGee returned to Dublin to take a place on the editorial staff of "The Freeman's Journal", but his advocacy of the advanced <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the Young <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> Party <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to leave that paper for a position on <a href="../cathen/05187a.htm">Charles Gavan Duffy's</a> "Nation", in which many of his poems and patriotic essays were printed. In the subsequent revolutionary episodes of 1848 he figured as one of the most active leaders, being the secretary of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Confederation, and was arrested and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for a short time because of an unwise speech. When the government began to suppress the movement and to arrest its leaders McGee escaped to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> disguised as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. In New York he started a paper called "The Nation", but soon got into trouble with Bishop Hughes over his violent revolutionary <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and diatribes against the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in their relation to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> politics. Changing the name of the paper to "The American Celt" he moved to <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, thence to Buffalo and again back to New York.

<p>In 1857 he settled in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> where he published another paper, "The New Era", and entering actively into local politics was elected to the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> Parliament, in which his ability as a speaker put him at once in the front rank. He changed the whole tenor of his political views and, as he advanced in official prominence, advocated British supremacy as loyally as he had formerly promoted the revolutionary doctrines of his youth. The Confederation of the British colonies of North America as the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Dominion of Canada</a> was due largely to his initiative. In the change of his political <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> he constantly embittered and attacked the revolutionary organizations of his fellow countrymen, and so made himself very obnoxious to them. It was this that led to his assassination by an overwrought fanatic. His literary activity in his earlier years brought forth many poems full of patriotic vigour, tenderness and melody, and a number of works, notably: "Irish Writers of the Seventeenth Century" (1846); "History of the Irish Settlers in North America" (1854); "History of the Attempt to establish the Protestant Reformation in Ireland" (1853); "Catholic History of North America" (1854); "History of Ireland" (1862).
