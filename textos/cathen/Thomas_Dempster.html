<h1>Thomas Dempster</h1>  

<p>Savant, professor, author; b., as he himself states at Cliftbog, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, 23 August, 1579; d. at Bologna <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 6 September 1625: son of Thomas, Baron of Muresk, Auchterless, and Killesmont, Aberdeenshire, and Jane Leslie, sister to the Baron of Balquhain; <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> t the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Turriff and Aberdeen. His troubulous life began early. On leaving <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, aged ten he went to Cambridge, leaving it shortly for <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Illness occasioned his removal to <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, whence, having attracted the notice of a representative of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, he was taken to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and there provided with a pension for his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. Through failing health he returned northwards to <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, but was immediately transferred to <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, means being forthcoming through royal bounty. On completion of a three years' course he returned to Tournai as professor of humanities. Tournai, however, he forsook for <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where, after graduating in canon law, he occupied at the age of seventeen, a professorial chair in the College de Navarre. He could not remain here either, and, after an interval in Poitou, he became professor of humanities again, this time at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. Before long, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in local dissentions sent him adrift once more. Declining a chair of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a>, he successfully competed for one of oratory at <a href="../cathen/11083a.htm">N&icirc;mes</a>. From this he was suspended, a lawsuit followed in vindication of his integrity. The post of tutor to the son of Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal de Saint-Luc he lost through unfriendly relations with the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of his patron. Once more adrift, he visited <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> vainly begged assistance from Kith and kin, and, through <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> intrigue, failed to recover his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> estates, which had been parted with by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. Seven years of professorship followed in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, at the end of which he was invited to reside in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> in the capacity of historian to James I. He married in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but only to bring on himself domestic misfortune. <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> influence having procured royal dismissal, he left for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and occupied under grand ducal auspices the chair of Civil law in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>. Further trouble led to his last change. In disgrace with the grand duke, he passed through Bologna, and there was provided with a chair in humanities. Even here he had his troubles, and had to clear himself of a suspicion of unorthodoxy before the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>. He lies buried in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Dominic at Bologna.

<p>Dempster's worth as an autobiographer and historian is much discounted by manifest <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and by immoderate self-praise and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the exaltation of his country. An unrestrained temper and resentful disposition, added to a harsh exterior, were, in spite of learning and good qualities, the cause of his unpopularity and many misfortunes. The seventeenth century <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> ecclesiastical historians generally resented Dempster's dishonest attempts to claim for <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> many <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and worthies of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> birth. <a href="../cathen/04099c.htm">John Colgan</a>, John Lynch and <a href="../cathen/15612c.htm">Stephen White</a>, all eminent scholars, entered against him (see W.T. Doherty, Inis-Owen and Triconnell, Dublin 1895, pp108-16).

<p>The chief of his many writings are: "Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Scotorum" published posthumously at Bologna, 1627; republished by Bannatyne Club, <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>, 1829; "Antiquitatum Romanarum Corpus Absolutissimum" "(Paris, 1613, 1743); "De Erutruria Regali", brought out during the Florentine professorship (latest edition, 1723-4); <em>"Keraunos kai Hobellos"</em> in Glossam librorum IV. Institutionum Justiniani" (Bologna, 1622), edition of Claudian; annotated edition of Benedetto Accolti's "De Bello a Christianis contra Barbaros Gesto" (Florence, 1623; Groningen, 1731); annotated edition of <a href="../cathen/01281b.htm">Aldrovandi's</a> "Quadrupedum omnium bisulcorum Historia" (Florence, 1623, 1647). His minor works include: tragedies, poems, especially "Musica Recidiva" thrice reprinted during his life.
