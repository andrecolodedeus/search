<h1>Thomas Dorman</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologian</a>, b. at Berkhampstead, Hertfordshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> uncertain; d. at <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, 1572 or 1577. He received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> through his uncle, Thomas Dorman of Agmondesham, now Amersham, Buckinghamshire. His master at Berkhampstead was Richard Reeve, a noted <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> schoolmaster. He was also known to Thomas Harding, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> scholar, then professor of Hebrew at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, who took great interest in the boy and sent him to Winchester <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in 1547. From Winchester Dorman went to New College at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, of which Harding was a fellow, and here he was elected a probationer fellow. During the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> revival under Mary he was appointed fellow of All Souls College (1554) and on 9 July, 1558, took the degree B.C.L. A year or two after Elizabeth's accession, finding that he could not live in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> without conforming to the new religion, he sacrificed his fellowship and his patrimony and went to <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, where he met Harding who was also an exile for the Faith. Harding persuaded him to resume his studies, and Dorman accordingly went to <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> and devoted himself to the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. In 1565 he became B.D. in the <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">University of Douai</a> and finally received the doctorate there. During this period he engaged in controversy with the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> divines, Jewel, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>, and Nowell, Dean of St. Paul's. In 1569, at the invitation of Dr. Allen, he joined the band of scholars at the newly founded English College at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> which he assisted both by his services and his private means. He died at <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a> where he had been given an important <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. His works are: "A proufe of certeyne articles in Religion denied by M. Juel" (Antwerp, 1564); "A Disproufe of M. Nowelle's Reproufe" (Antwerp, 1565); "A Request to Mr. Jewel that he keep his promise made by solemn Protestation in his late Sermon at Paul's Cross" (London, 1567; Louvain, 1567).
