<h1>Thomas Ebendorfer</h1>  

<p>German chronicler, professor, and statesman, b. 12 August, 1385, at Haselbach, in Upper <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>; d. at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 8 Jan., 1464. He made his higher studies at the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a>, where in 1412 he received the degree of Master of Arts. Until 1427 he was attached to the <a href="../cathen/01757a.htm">Faculty of Arts</a> and lectured on <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> and Latin grammar. After 1419 he was also admitted to the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty as <em>cursor biblicus</em>. In 1427 he was made licentiate and in 1428 master of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>; soon after he became dean of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty, in which body he was a professor until his death. Three several times, 1423, 1429, and 1445 he was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a>; he was also canon of St. Stephen's, and engaged in the apostolic ministry as preacher and as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Perchtoldsdorf and of Falkenstein near <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. He ranks high among the professors of the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a> in the fifteenth century. In the struggles which it had to sustain he championed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and interests of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and energy. He represented the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at the Council of Basle (1432-34), took an active part in all its discussions, and was one of the delegates sent by the council to Prague to confer with the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a>. From 1440 to 1444 he was sent to various cities as ambassador of Emperor Frederick III. He disapproved of the attitude of the Council of Basle towards both <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and emperor, and eventually withdrew from it. His advocacy of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> University, coupled with the attacks of his opponents lost him the favour of the emperor, who saw in him a secret enemy. In 1451 and 1452 he was in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where he obtained from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a confirmation of the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between Frederick III and <a href="../cathen/01262a.htm">Albert of Brandenburg</a> he tried to act as mediator but only fell into greater disfavour with Frederick. His last years were clouded by the disturbances of the years 1461-1463 during which <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> had much to suffer from the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> king, George of Podiebrad, and from internal conflicts.

<p>Ebendorfer is one of the most prominent chroniclers of the fifteenth century. His "Chronicon Austriae" is a dull but frank and very detailed history of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> to 1463. From 1400 on it is an indispensable source of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> history (ed. Pez in "Scriptores rerum Austriacarum", II, Leipzig, 1725, 689-986; in this edition all of Book I and part of Book II were omitted). His account of the Council of Basle appears in the "Diarium gestorum concilii Basileensis pro reductione Bohemorum" (ed. Birk in Monumenta concilii Basileensis, Scriptores, I, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1875, 701-783). He wrote also a history of the Roman emperors, "Chronica regum Romanorum"; Books VI and VII, which are of independent value as sources, were edited by Pribram in the "Mitteilungen des Instituts f&uuml;r &ouml;sterreichische Geschichtsforschung", third supplementary volume (Innsbruck, 1890-94), 38-222. Many of his writings are as yet unedited, among them commentaries on Biblical books, sermons, "Liber de schismatibus", "Liber Pontificum Romanorum" (see Levinson, "Thomas Ebendorfers Liber Pontificum" in "Mitteilungen des Instituts fur osterreichische Geschichtsforschung", XX, 1899, 69-99).
