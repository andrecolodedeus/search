<h1>Thomas Edward Bridgett</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Priest</a> and author, b. at Derby, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 20 January, 1829, of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; d. at St. Mary's Clapham, 17 February, 1899. His father was a silk manufacturer, and sent his son first to Mill Hill, a Congregationalist College near <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, then to Tonbridge, a <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a> public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at the age of sixteen, and finally, in October, 1847, to St John's College, Cambridge, the home of <a href="../cathen/08462b.htm">Blessed John Fisher</a> whose life Father Bridgett afterwards wrote. In 1850, while an undergraduate, he left the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> being unable to accept the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of Royal Supremacy which was then required before taking a degree. Shortly afterwards, having attended <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Dr. Newman's</a> lectures on "Anglican Difficulties" at the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Oratory, he was received into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the Oratorian, Father Stanton, 12 June, 1850, and on 15 October of the next year made his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of St. Trond, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. He pursued his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at Wittem in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in August, 1856. After being five years minister and consultor to the vice-provincial in Clapham, the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> house of his Congregation, he went to Limerick for nine years, where as <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> he founded, in 1868, the celebrated Confraternity of the Holy Family for men. This soon consisted of over 5,000 active members, the largest association of its kind in any one locality, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 1871, he returned to Clapham as <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, where he spent the greater part of his remaining years.

<p>Father Bridgett was a missionary like all the members of his Congregation, but with advancing years he devoted himself to giving retreats, particularly to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. It was not till 1867 that he turned his thoughts to writing a sermon on ritual developing into his first book, "In Spirit and in Truth". This work was called in later editions "The Ritual of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>". It was followed in 1875 by "Our Lady's Dowry", showing by many illustrations from history and literature the <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion</a> of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>. In this and in "The History of the Holy Eucharist in Great Britain", a work on the same plan published in 1881, the author shows a learning which is truly encyclopedic. The "Life of Blessed John Fisher", which led to a correspondence with Mr. Gladstone, followed in 1888; "The True Story of the Catholic Hierarchy deposed by Queen Elizabeth", a work written in conjunction with Father Knox of the Oratory, came out in 1889; "Blunders and Forgeries", a very fine piece of cross-examination, in 1890; and the "Life of Blessed Thomas More", his most popular work, in 1891. Father Bridgett also published devotional verse of considerable merit, both in a collection which he edited called "Lyre Hieratica", and in "Sonnets and Epigrams", an entirely original work. He died after a long and painful illness and was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cemetery at Mortlake, near London.
