<h1>Thomas Fitzherbert</h1>  

<p>Born 1552, at Swynnerton, Staffs, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; died 17 Aug., 1640, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His father having died whilst Thomas was an infant, he was, even as a child, the head of an important <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and the first heir born at Swynnerton, where his descendants have since flourished and still remain <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. He was trained to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and firmness in his religion by his mother, and when sent to Oxford in his sixteenth year he confessed his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> that grew with the various trials, of which he has left us an interesting memoir (<a href="../cathen/16041a.htm">Foley</a>, "Records of English Province S.J.", II, 210). At last he was forced to keep in hiding, and in 1572 he suffered <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. In 1580 he married and had issue, but he did not give up his works of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. When <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Campion</a> and <a href="../cathen/11729a.htm">Persons</a> commenced their memorable mission, Fitzherbert put himself at their service, and helped <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Campion</a> in the preparation of his "Decem Rationes" by verifying quotations and copying passages from the fathers in various <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>, to which it would have been impossible for the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> to obtain admission. Unable at last to maintain his position in face of the ever-growing <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, he left <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1582, and took up his residence in the north of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Here, as a lay <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> of birth, means, and unexceptionable character, he was much trusted by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> leaders, and as sedulously watched by Walsingham's emissaries, whose letters contain frequent insinuations against his intentions and ulterior objects (see <a href="../cathen/16041a.htm">Foley</a>, "Records of English Province S.J.", II, 220-228). His wife died in 1588, and he soon afterwards took a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a>. He is next found in the household of the young Duke of Feria, whose mother was Lady Anne Dormer. With him or in his service he lived in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for some twenty years, until the duke died in 1607, on the point of setting out for a diplomatic mission to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, on which Fitzherbert was to have accompanied him. It was during this period that he was charged in 1598 by Squire with having tempted him to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> Queen Elizabeth; in 1595 a charge of contradictory implication had been preferred against him to the Spanish Government, viz. that he was an agent of Elizabeth. Both charges led to the enhancement of his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>. An interesting series of 200 letters from the duke to him is preserved in the archives of the <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Archdiocese of Westminster</a>. In 1601, while in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, he felt moved to take a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to offer himself for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> 24 March, 1602. After this he acted as Roman agent for the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> <a href="../cathen/07143c.htm">Harrison</a> until he was succeeded, in 1609, by the future <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Richard Smith. But in 1606 he had made a third <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, namely, to enter the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, which he did about the year 1613. He was soon given the important post of superior in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, 1616 to 1618, afterwards recalled and made <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05472b.htm">English College, Rome</a>, from 1618 to 1639. He died there, closing, at the age of eighty-eight years, a life that had been filled with an unusual variety of important <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. His principal works are: "A Defence of the Catholycke Cause, By T.F., with an Apology of his innocence in a fayned conspiracy of Edward Squire" (St-Omer, 1602); "A Treatise concerning Policy and Religion" (Douai, 1606-10, 1615), translated into Latin in 1630. This work was highly valued for its sound and broad-minded criticism of the lax political principles professed in those days. He also wrote books in the controversy that grew out of King James's Oath of Allegiance: "A Supplement to [Father Persons's] the Discussion of M. D. Barlow" (St-Omer, 1613); "A Confutation of certaine Absurdities uttered by M. D. Andrews" (St-Omer, 1613); "Of the Oath of Fidelity" (St-Omer, 1614); "The Obmutesce of F. F. to the Epphata of D. Collins" (St-Omer, 1621). We have also from his pen a translation of Turcellini's "Life of St. Francis Xavier" (Paris, 1632).
