<h1>Thomas Fleming</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, son of the Baron of Slane, b. in 1593; d. in 1665. He studied at the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, became a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>, and after finishing his studies continued at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> for a number of years as professor. In October, 1623, he was appointed by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> to Dublin as successor of Archbishop Matthews. His appointment gave great offense to opponents of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, and a bitter onslaught was begun against the new <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Paul Harris, in his "Olfactorium" and other brochures. Archbishop Fleming convened and presided at a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">provincial synod</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">province</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> in 1640. When the Confederate <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> broke out (1641-1642) the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, though rather a man of peace, felt constrained to take sides with the Confederates and despatched a <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> to represent him at the synod of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> held in Kilkenny (May, 1642). Later on, when the general assembly was convoked at Kilkenny for October, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> resolved to attend personally and take part in the deliberations. As might be expected from his antecedents, and especially from his connection with the Anglo-Irish nobility of the Pale, he was opposed to the "thorough" policy of the Old <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, and wished for peace at all costs. In 1643 he was one of the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who signed the commission empowering representatives of the Confederates to treat with Ormond for a cessation of hostilities. He also opposed Scarampa and <a href="../cathen/13061a.htm">Rinuccini</a>, the later of whom was strongly identified with Old-Irish party. In 1649, when all was lost, and the defeated <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> were confronted with Cromwell, a reconciliation was effected with Ormond at a synod of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, a step which Archbishop Fleming favoured. But even then King Charles could not recognize his real friends, and the alliance was broken off. The remainder of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> life was much disturbed by religious <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> carried on by the government of Cromwell. He died in 1655, and the severity of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> may be judged from the fact that until 1669 no successor could be appointed. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was administered by <a href="../cathen/15401a.htm">vicars</a> until the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of <a href="../cathen/14432c.htm">Peter Talbot</a> in 1669.
