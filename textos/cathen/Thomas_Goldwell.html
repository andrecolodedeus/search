<h1>Thomas Goldwell</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01766a.htm">St. Asaph</a>, the last survivor of the ancient <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; b. probably at the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> manor of Goldwell, in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Great Chart, near Ashford, Kent, between 1501 and 1515; d. in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 3 April, 1585. He was a member of a Kentish <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of ancient lineage, long seated at Goldwell; and was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at All Souls College, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, where he graduated M. A. in 1531, and B. D. in 1534. While at Oxford he attained more eminence in mathematics, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, and kindred <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, than in divinity or the humanities, a point worth remembering in view of his future career. He stood out firmly against the innovations in religion brought about by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>. At an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> he became intimate with <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Reginald, afterwards Cardinal, Pole</a>, a friendship which proved to be a lanlasting one, and which had considerable influence on Goldwell's subsequent career. Soon after 1535, when the king had begun his drastic measures of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> spoliation, Goldwell became <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Pole's</a> <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> and joined him in exile, being included in the same Act of <a href="../cathen/02059c.htm">Attainder</a> "for casting off his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to the King, and submitting to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>". He reached <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1538, and shortly afterwards he was appointed <em>camerarius</em> of the English Hospital of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>. In 1547 he became a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatine</a> House of St. Paul, at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. On the death of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Pole</a>, now a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, asked and obtained permission for Goldwell to accompany him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and thus he was present at the long <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> of 1549-50 in the capacity of <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Pole's</a> personal attendant. After the election of <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a>, Goldwell returned to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and made his profession as a <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatine</a>. In 1553, while Edward VI was still reigning an Act of General Pardon was passed, from which Goldwel had the signal <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of being specially excepted by name, along with <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Pole</a> and some others. On the accession of Mary I there came an all too brief spell of prosperity for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Pole</a>, now <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> with Goldwell in his train, and the latter was soon nominated to the See of <a href="../cathen/01766a.htm">St. Asaph</a> in North <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> (1555). While still only bishop-designate, he was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (2 July, 1555) to make a report on the state of religion in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>.

<p>While at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, on this occasion, he was probably <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; and he returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> at the end of the year. In 1556 he assisted at the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Pole</a> to the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. He was then for some time actively engaged in the affairs of his Diocese of <a href="../cathen/01766a.htm">St. Asaph</a>. He issued numerous injunctions to his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, prohibiting married <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from saying <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>, and forbade the use of churches as poor-schools. He revived the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> well of <a href="../cathen/15656a.htm">St. Winefride</a>, at <a href="../cathen/07438a.htm">Holywell</a>, and obtained from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a renewal of the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> for <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> to that shrine. He also examined the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> John Philpot, which fact is chronicled ion no friendly way by Foxe ("Acts and Monuments", ed. Townsend, VII, 620). It was about this time proposed, though without his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or consent, to make him ambassador to the court of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and to translate him to the See of Oxford; letters of credence to <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> had been actually made out; and on 5 Nov., 1558, he received the custody of the temporalities of the See of Oxford, <a href="../cathen/15698a.htm">Thomas Wood</a> having received that of <a href="../cathen/01766a.htm">St. Asaph</a> four days previously. But the death of <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a> on 17 November terminated all these arrangements. Just at this juncture Goldwell was at the deathbed of <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a>, to whom he gave the last <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p>The accession of Elizabeth was, of course, the signal for the final attack of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> upon the ancient Faith. Goldwell strenuously resisted as far as in him lay. It is interesting to note by what dishonourable and underhand methods the queen's party put it out of his power to make his protest in a constitutional manner. It was alleged that, by his <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> to <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, he was no longer <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01766a.htm">St. Asaph</a>; but that, as he had not done homage to the queen for Oxford, he was not yet <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Accordingly, he did not receive the summons to Parliament which was undoubtedly his legal due. In May, 1559, however, he was summoned before the queen with the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and all of them were expelled from their sees for their refusal to take the <a href="../cathen/11177a.htm">oath of supremacy</a>. He then resolved to leave the country, for, as he afterwards stated, he was not allowed to perform a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> office, say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>, or administer the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, as long as he remained in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.

<p>Although the ports were being watched for him, he succeeded in making his escape. It was obviously impossible for him to have carried off the register and records of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> under such circumstances. This charge, however, has been maliciously made against him. He then became an active <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> exile. He started at once for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but was detained at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> by sickness. He refused the offer of an <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, preferring to devote himself to his order (the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a>) and to the conversion of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In 1561 he was made superior of his old <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and also warden of the English Hospital at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was the only <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, where he was treated with marked respect. He was there engaged in the revision of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>; and also urged the council to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> Queen Elizabeth. His mere presence at <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> was a cause of such excessive annoyance to Elizabeth that she wrote the following extraordinary farrago of falsehood to her German envoy Mundt: "We think it may be that one Goldwell, a very simple and fond man, having in our late sister's time been named to a small <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> called <a href="../cathen/01766a.htm">St. Asaph</a>, <em>though never thereto admitted,</em> flying out of the realm upon our sister's death, is gone to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as a renegade, and there using the name of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <em>without order or title,</em> is perhaps gone <em>in the train of some <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a></em> to <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>, and so it is likely the speech hath arisen of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> being there." In 1563 Goldwell was <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>. In 1567 he was made vicar of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> in the Lateran, and in 1574 the Cardinal Vicar Savelli made him his vicegerent; he thus became, so to speak, the "working" <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Hall, an English traveller in 1568, said that Goldwell was the only English <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> who was courteous to him. In 1580, in spite of his advanced age, he set out for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> at the head of the mission which included <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Campion</a> and <a href="../cathen/11729a.htm">Persons</a>, but he was taken ill at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. One of the last acts of his long and strenuous career was to serve on the Congregation for the Revision of the Roman Martyrology, in 1582. On the death of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lincoln, in 1584, Goldwell became the sole survivor of the ancient <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. He died the next year, and was buried at St. Sylvester's. A portrait of him exists at the English College, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.
