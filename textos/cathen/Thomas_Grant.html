<h1>Thomas Grant</h1>  

<p>First <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14162b.htm">Southwark</a>; b. at Ligny-les-Aires, <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 25 Nov., 1816; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1 June, 1870. He was the son of Bernard Grant, an Irishman who enlisted in the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> army, became sergeant, and finally purchased a commission. His mother, Ann MacGowan, was also <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> by birth. In January, 1829, he was sent to <a href="../cathen/15233b.htm">Ushaw College</a>, where he studied until 1836, when he went to the English College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. There he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 28 Nov., 1841, was created doctor of divinity and appointed as secretary to Cardinal Acton, a position in which he acquired a thorough <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of canon law, and an intimate acquaintance with the method of conducting <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In October, 1844, at the early age of twenty-eight, he became <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the English College, and was made agent for the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. In this capacity he was of great assistance to <a href="../cathen/15121a.htm">Dr. Ullathorne</a>, who was then negotiating for the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. He also translated for <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> all English documents relating to the matter, and furnished the materials for the historical preface to the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 1850. A year later, he was appointed to the new <a href="../cathen/14162b.htm">Diocese of Southwark</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on 6 July, 1851. Though he came to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> almost as a stranger, he soon won the confidence of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and others. As the Government was shy of transacting business directly with <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a>, many negotiations were carried on by Dr. Grant, who was specially successful in obtaining from the Government the appointment of military and naval <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, as well as <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>.

<p>To the newly appointed <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> he was, as <a href="../cathen/15121a.htm">Bishop Ullathorne</a> testified, most useful: "His acuteness of learning, readiness of resource and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the forms of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> business made him invaluable to our joint counsels at home, whether in <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> or in our yearly episcopal meetings; and his obligingness, his untiring spirit of work, and the expedition and accuracy with which he struck off documents in Latin, Italian, or English, naturally brought the greater part of such work on his shoulders." In the administration of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> he <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> equal to the task of organization, which was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in an age of rapid expansion, while the remarkable <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of his private life led to his being generally regarded as a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, and caused <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, when he learned of his death, to exclaim "Another saint in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>!" The virtues of charity and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> in particular were practised by him in an heroic degree. The last years of his life were spent in great suffering, caused by cancer, and when he set out to attend the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1870, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he would not return. He was appointed member of the Congregation for the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Oriental Rites</a> and the Apostolic Missions, but was too ill to take an active part in the proceedings. After death his body was brought back to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> for burial. His works were a translation of the "Hidden Treasure" of <a href="../cathen/09178c.htm">Blessed Leonard of Port Maurice</a> (Edinburgh, 1855), and "Meditations of the Sisters of Mercy before Renewal of Vows" (London, 1874)
