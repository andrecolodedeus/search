<h1>Thomas Griffiths</h1>  

<p>Born in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 2 June, 1791; died 19 August, 1847; the first and only <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the London District <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> wholly in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. At the age of thirteen he was sent to St. Edmund's College, Old Hall, where he went through the whole course, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1814. Four years later he was chosen as president, at the early age of twenty-seven. He ruled the college with remarkable success for fifteen years, at the end of which time he was appointed coadjutor to Bishop Bramston, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the London District. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Olena at <a href="../cathen/11239a.htm">St. Edmund's College</a>, 28 October, 1833. Within three years Bishop Bramston died, and Bishop Griffiths succeeded him.

<p>It was a time when great activities, which reached their full development later under <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a>, were already beginning to show themselves. The agitation for a regular <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> became more and more pronounced and as a preliminary measure, in 1840, the four <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> "districts" into which <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> had been divided since the reign of James II were subdivided to form eight, Dr. Griffiths retaining the new <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> District. Soon after this, the Oxford conversions began: before Dr. Griffiths died, <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> had been a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> nearly two years, and many others had followed him into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. There was also a revival of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a>, due to the enthusiasm of <a href="../cathen/12558b.htm">Pugin</a>, while the immigration of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, in consequence of the potato famine, necessitated the opening of many new missions. At the same time the growth of the British colonies, many of which had been lately ruled as part of the London District, brought him into contact with the government. In all these different spheres Dr. Griffiths discharged his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> with great practical ability; but it was thought that he would not have the breadth of view or experience <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for initiating the new <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, and according to <a href="../cathen/15121a.htm">Bishop Ullathorne</a>, this was the reason why its establishment was postponed. He bears witness, however, to the esteem in which Dr. Griffiths was held, and when the latter died, somewhat unexpectedly, in 1847 <a href="../cathen/15121a.htm">Ullathorne</a> himself preached the funeral sermon. The body of the deceased <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> was laid temporarily in the vaults of Moorfields Church; but two years later it was removed to St. Edmund's College, where a new <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> by <a href="../cathen/12558b.htm">Pugin</a> was in course of erection, and a special <a href="../cathen/03573c.htm">chantry</a> was built to receive the body of Dr. Griffiths, to whose initiative the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was due. An oil <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of Dr. Griffiths is at Archbishop's House, Westminster; another, more modern, at <a href="../cathen/11239a.htm">St. Edmund's College</a>.
