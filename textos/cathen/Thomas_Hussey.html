<h1>Thomas Hussey</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15564b.htm">Waterford and Lismore</a>, b. at Ballybogan, Co. Meath, in 1746; d. at Tramore, Co. Waterford, 11 July, 1803. At an early age he was sent to the <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a> of Salamanca, and after completing his studies joined the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a>. His ability was such, however, that he was requested by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to take orders, was associated for a time with the court of the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and soon became prominent in <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. In or about 1767 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the Spanish embassy in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> attached to it. He made the acquaintance of Dr. Johnson, Edmund Burke, and other famous people, and was regarded by them as one of the ablest and best informed men of his time. In March, 1792, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society. When the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and America broke out, the Spanish ambassador was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> having taken sides against <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and Dr. Hussey was entrusted with Spanish affairs, and was thus brought into direct contact with George III, as well as with Pitt and other <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>. He was sent to <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> to endeavour to detach <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> from the American cause, but without success. In <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> he met Richard Cumberland, the dramatist, who, though jealous of him, speaks highly of his ability, incorruptibility, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and declares that he would have headed a revolution to overthrow the English Church in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. He took up the catholic cause earnestly and was deputed by the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to lay their position before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but the Spanish embassy would not grant him leave of absence. George III, Pitt, and the Duke of <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Portland</a> entrusted him with a mission to the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> soldiers and militia in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> who were disaffected, but when he heard their story, he pleaded in their behalf much to the distaste of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> executive. Portland induced him to stay in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> to assist in the foundation of <a href="../cathen/10087b.htm">Maynooth College</a>, and in 1795 he was appointed its first president. He was shortly after made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15564b.htm">Waterford and Lismore</a>. In 1797 he issued a pastoral to his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, strongly resenting Government interference in <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>. This protest gave great offence to the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>. He was received by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in March, 1798, and is said, but upon slight evidence, to have been a party to the Concordat between <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> and <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>. Lecky describes him as "the ablest English-speaking <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of his time".
