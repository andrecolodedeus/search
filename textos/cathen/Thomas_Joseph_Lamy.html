<h1>Thomas Joseph Lamy</h1>  

<p>Biblical scholar end orientalist, b. at Ohey, in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, 27 Jan., 1827, d. at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, 30 July, 1907. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1853 after completing his studies at <a href="../cathen/06105b.htm">Floreffe</a> and at the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a>, he entered the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a> and received from his professors, <a href="../cathen/02388a.htm">Beelen</a>, the distinguished <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegete</a> and orientalist, and Lefebre, who was well versed in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">positive theology</a>, his impulse towards Biblical, Oriental, and patristic studies. He obtained the degree of Doctor of Theology in 1859. His career as professor at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> began in 1858 and continued uninterrupted till the year 1900, comprising courses in Hebrew, Syriac, introduction to <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>. Lamy succeeded Beelen on the latter's retirement in 1875. His writings, too voluminous for enumeration here, are listed in the bibliography of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> down to 1905, under one hundred and fifty-eight entries. His most valuable contributions to learning took the form of editions of many previously unpublished Syriac writings, notably his collection in six volumes of <a href="../cathen/05498a.htm">St. Ephraem's</a> <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and discourses, under the title "Sancti Ephraemi Syri Hymni et Sermones", and his edition of the "Chronicon Ecclesiasticum" of <a href="../cathen/02294a.htm">Bar Hebraeus</a>. It is freely admitted that his editions of text are marred by numerous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, chiefly typographical. He is most widely known by his "Introductio in Sacram Scripturam", in 2 vols., which ran to six editions, an erudite collection of materials valuable in their day. Of his commentaries the most noted are his Latin commentary on Genesis, in 2 vols. (2nd ed., 1883-84), and his French commentary on the Apocalypse (1893-94). Neither in his introduction nor in his commentaries did Lamy grapple with the difficulties of the day; his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, acquired in the sixth decade of the nineteenth century, remained unmodified till the end. His "Introduction" passed almost unchanged through six editions. Lamy's numerous articles show his great devotion to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to his <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and to his country, as well as a marked predilection for Biblical and patristic studies. Before his death, which occurred at the age of eighty, Lamy was engaged in the revision and annotation of a French translation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. Besides his professorial labors, he served his <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> for thirty years as president of the College Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se. By his simplicity, his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and kindness of heart, he won numerous friends in all ranks of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and exerted a gentle but effective and wide influence for good. Lamy received many honors from learned <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> and from his country; he was made domestic <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> (1885) by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, and member of the <a href="../cathen/02557a.htm">Biblical Commission</a> (1903) by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>.
