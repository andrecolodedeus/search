<h1>Thomas Lewis Brittain</h1>  

<p>Born near <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 1744; died at Hartpury Court, 1827. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, but at the age of sixteen Thomas <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Shortly after his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> he went to Picardy to pursue his studies, and later joined the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> at Bornheim, where he made his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">profession</a> 22 October, 1767. His studies were continued at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, and subsequently he taught with marked success at Bornheim, where he was made regent of studies. In 1790 the doctor's cap, with title of Master of Sacred Theology, was conferred on him. The same year he was transferred to <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> where he became director of the exiled <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, an office he held for thirty-seven years. In 1794, when the French army was expected at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> Father Brittain conducted the sisters to Bornheim whence, joined by eighteen <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> fathers, they were conducted by an American captain to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Father Brittain secured a foundation for the sisters at Hartpury Court near Gloucester. On 3 May, 1814, he was elected <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, and during his four Years of office gained the respect and confidence of his brethren. He is the author of the following works: "Rudiments of English Grammar" (London, 1790), considered authoritative in its day and highly recommended by Walker, the lexicographer; "Principles of the Christian religion and Catholic Faith Investigated" (London, 1790); "Collection of Poems Occasionally Written" (Cheltenham, 1822); "The Divinity of Jesus Christ and beauties of His Gospels" (London, 1822); some unpublished <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are the <a href="../cathen/01696a.htm">archives</a> of the English <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">province</a>.
