<h1>Thomas Lister</h1>  

<p>(<em>alias</em> Thomas Butler)

<p><a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> writer, b. in Lancashire, about 1559; d. in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, probably before 1628; was the son of Christopher Lister, of Midhope, Yorks. He entered <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai College</a>, 1576. Having occasion to return to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, he was seized and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>. He, however, obtained his release, and in 1579 was received into the <a href="../cathen/05472b.htm">English College</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. There, three years later, he joined the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in February, 1582-3. He graduated in Divinity at Pont-&agrave;-Mousson in 1592. In 1596 he went on to the English mission, but was arrested in 1598 and endured a long incarceration. Just at this point difficulties had broken out among the English <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, owing to the refusal of certain among them to recognize the authority of the newly appointed <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a>, Dr. George Blackwell. Lister was consulted by one of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> as to the conduct of those who refused obedience. While a man of both <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and ability, he was unfortunately lacking in judgment; and his reply took the form of a small treatise entitled "Adversus factiosos in ecclesia", in which their conduct was vigorously censured. They are declared to have <em>ipso facto</em> have fallen into <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and to have incurred <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether this tractate was published; but it was widely circulated in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, and aroused the deepest resentment. It certainly served not a little to fan the flames of the unhappy dispute. To the request of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> that he would prohibit it, Blackwell replied curtly (April, 1957): "Your request is that we should call in the treatise against your <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>; and this is unreasonable, because the medicine ought not to be removed until the sore be thoroughly cured. If it grieve you, I am not grieved thereat." His conduct in regard to Lister's tract formed the first of the six grounds on which was based the "Appeal of thirty-three clergymen", against his administration. The appellants obtained a favourable hearing at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Lister's tract was suppressed by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Brief</a> (May, 1601), and Blackwell rebuked for his unreasonable conduct. Lister seems to have resided continuously in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. His death probably occurred shortly before 1628. The treatise "Adversus factiosos" is incorporated into <a href="../cathen/02203e.htm">Christopher Bagshaw's</a> "Relatio compendium turbarum"; a portion of it is printed in Law's work cited below.
