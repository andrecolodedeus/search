<h1>Thomas Louis Green</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Priest</a> and controversialist; b. at Stourbridge, Worcestershire, 1799; d. at Newport, Shropshire, 27 Feb., 1883. He was the son of Francis Green of Solihull Lodge, Warwickshire, and as a boy was entrusted to the care of <a href="../cathen/10315a.htm">Bishop Milner</a>, by whom he was sent to Sedgley Park School, and afterwards in 1813 to Oscott. Having completed his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies there, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in Feb., 1825, and remained at the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> as <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>. In 1828 he succeeded the Rev. J. McDonnell at <a href="../cathen/11121a.htm">Norwich</a>, where he became known as a controversialist. Challenged to a public disputation, Green declined on the ground that no real good would be effected, but harm would arise owing to the excited and prejudiced feelings prevalent. He, however, undertook to meet all charges in a course of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a>, which he did successfully. After two years he went to Tixall, Staffordshire, as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Sir Clifford Constable, Baronet, and while there was engaged in a controversy with the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, in which he strove, though fruitlessly, to have the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> burial service omitted in cases of the interment of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churchyard. In 1846 he went back to Oscott as prefect of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a>, a post which he held for two years before becoming <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to St. Mary's Priory, Princethorpe, near Coventry. He was <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at Mawley, Shropshire, in 1858, and at Madeley, Shropshire, in 1859, while in 1860 he became <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Lord Acton at Aldenham Park, near Bridgnorth, Shropshire, where he remained for the rest of his active life. In 1868 <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> granted him the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity in recognition of his services. He retired shortly before he died to Salter's Hall, Newport, Shropshire.

<p>His works were: "A series of discourses on the principal controverted points of Catholic Doctrine delivered at . . . Norwich" (Norwich, 1830), reprinted under the title "Argumentative Discourses" in 1837; "A Correspondence between the Protestant Rector of Tixall and the Catholic Chaplain of Sir Clifford Constable" (Stafford, 1834); "A Letter addressed to Rev. Clement Leigh" (London, 1836); "The Truth, the Whole Truth, and Nothing but the Truth" (London, 1838); "The Secular Clergy Fund of the late Midland District" (London, 1853, privately printed); "Rome, Purgatory, Indulgences, Idolatry, etc." (Bridgnorth, 1863); "Indulgences, Sacramental Absolutions and Tax Tables of the Roman Chancery and Penitentiary considered in reply to the charge of Venality" (London, 1872, 1880). He also contributed to the "Orthodox Journal", "Catholic Magazine" and "True Tablet".
