<h1>Thomas Maria Mamachi</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and historian, born at <a href="../cathen/03689b.htm">Chios</a> in the Archipelago, 4 December, 1713; died at <a href="../cathen/03798b.htm">Corneto</a>, near <a href="../cathen/10529a.htm">Montefiascone</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 7 June, 1792. At the age of sixteen he entered the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/03689b.htm">Chios</a> and passed later to St. Mark's at Florence and the Minerva at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1740 he was appointed professor of physics in the Sapienza, and in 1743 taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>. His residence at Florence and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> brought him into contact with brilliant men of his order, e.g. <a href="../cathen/11325a.htm">Orsi</a>, Divelli, and <a href="../cathen/04191a.htm">Concina</a>, and greatly facilitated his progress in his studies. He collaborated with <a href="../cathen/11325a.htm">Orsi</a> in his "De Romani pontificis in synodos oecumenicas et earum canones potestate". Soon <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> appointed him prefect of the Casanatensian Library, master of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and consultor of the Congregation of the Index. Owing to his office he had to take part in the controversy between the Appellants (<a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>) and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and displayed an impartiality which greatly increased the difficulties of his anxious and laborious position. He engaged in lively <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> controversies with Mansi and Cadonici. He had, likewise, to intervene in the controversy concerning the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> of <a href="../cathen/11414a.htm">Blessed Palafox</a>. In a published writing on this question, he dealt severely with the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> party who opposed the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a>; but he was not less energetic in dealing with their opponents, the Appellants and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> Church of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>. He was director of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> journal of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1742-85), and established at his residence a reunion of the learned Roman <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>.

<p>Mamachi was a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> supporter of the power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a>. Involved in all the controversy of the day, he was one of the first to take issue with <a href="../cathen/07463a.htm">Febronius</a>. <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> made him secretary of the Index (1779) and afterwards <a href="../cathen/10039a.htm">Master of the Sacred Palace</a>, and frequently availed himself of his advice and of his pen. Mamachi's great work was to have been his "Christian Antiquities", but his labours in the field of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> absorbed so much of his time that he published only four of the twenty books that he planned. Moreover, he lived in an age when the good method inaugurated by Bosio had been abandoned and, considered as an archaeological work, the synthesis which he had projected is valueless. A second edition, however, appeared in 1842-1851. His chief writings are: <ul><li>"De ratione temporum Athanasiorum deque aliquot synodis IV saeculo celebratis" (Florence, 1748) <li>"Originum et antiquitatum christianarum libri XX" (4 vols. Rome, 1749-55) <li>"Dei costumi dei primitivi cristiani" (3 vols. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1753 sqq.) <li>"Epistolae ad Justinum Febronium de ratione regendae christianae reipublicae (2 vols. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1776-77).</ul>
