<h1>Thomas Messingham</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> hagiologist, born in the <a href="../cathen/10097a.htm">Diocese of Meath</a>, and studied in the <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a>, Paris, proceeding to the degree of S.T.D. Among the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Manuscripts in Dublin is an interesting tract sent by <a href="../cathen/13207a.htm">David Rothe</a>, Vice-Primate of All <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, addressed to my "loving friend Mr. Thomas Messingham at his chambers in Paris", <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1615. It is evident that at this <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> Messingham was one of the staff of the <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a> in that city, and was commencing his studies on <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. In 1620 he published Offices of SS. <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick</a>, Brigid, Columba, and other <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; and in the following year was appointed <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a>, Paris, in succession to his friend and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a>, <a href="../cathen/04660b.htm">Thomas Dease</a>, who was promoted to the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/10097a.htm">Meath</a>, on 5 May, 1621. Messingham was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and was raised to the dignity of prothonotary Apostolic, and acted as agent for many of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Though diligent in the quest for materials with a view to an <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, Messingham <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a most able and judicious <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a>, and he thoroughly organized the course of studies with a view of sending forth capable missionaries to work in their native country. He got the college affiliated formally to the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, and, in 1626, got the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> for the rules he had drawn up for the government of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. In 1624 he published, at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, his famous work on <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, "Florilegium Insul&aelig; Sanctorum", containing also an interesting treatise on <a href="../cathen/12580a.htm">St. Patrick's Purgatory</a>, in Lough Derg. In the same year he was appointed by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to the Deanery of St. Patrick's Cathedral, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, in succession to Henry Byrne, but this position was merely honorary, inasmuch as all the temporalities were enjoyed by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> dean, by patent from the Crown. Messingham had a lengthy correspondence with <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Father Luke Wadding, O.F.M.</a>, and was frequently consulted by the Roman authorities in the matter of selecting suitable <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> to fill the vacant <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. On 15 July, 1630, he wrote to <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Wadding</a> that he feared it was in vain to hope for any indulgences in religious disabilities from King Charles I. Between the years 1632 and 1638 he laboured for the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church in various capacities, but his name disappears after the latter year, whence we may conclude that he either resigned or died in 1638.
