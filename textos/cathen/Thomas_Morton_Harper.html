<h1>Thomas Morton Harper</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Priest</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and preacher. Born in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> 26 Sept., 1821, of <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> being a merchant of good means in the City; d. 29 Aug., 1893. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> first at St. Paul's School, London; then at Queen's College, <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">Oxford</a>. Having taken his <a href="../cathen/01756c.htm">B.A. degree</a>, he subsequently received <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">orders in the Anglican Church</a>, in which he worked for five years as a <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a>. His first mission was at Barnstaple in Devonshire. Here he manifested High Church proclivities and took a vigorous part in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> controversies in the local press. Getting into collision with his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on some points of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, he left Devonshire and purchased a small proprietary <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in a poor district in Pimlico, London. But his ritualistic views and practices here again brought him into conflict with his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> &mdash; Blomfield, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. He was obviously drifting steadily towards the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The final impulse came oddly enough, from the perusal of an attack on the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Order</a> in a volume entitled "One Year in the Noviceship of the Society of Jesus" by Andrew Steinmetz. Harper's <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> discerned the intrinsic discrepancies of the book and the feebleness of the argument as a whole. Within half a year he was received into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and some months later, in October, 1852, he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. He passed through his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">noviceship</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. His four years' <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course was divided between the English Jesuit Theological College, <a href="../cathen/02540a.htm">St. Beuno's</a> in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1859, he was appointed professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> the following year at <a href="../cathen/02540a.htm">St. Beuno's</a> College. Two years later he was transferred to the chair of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> and general <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> at St. Mary's Hall, Stonyhurst. A man of highly-strung nervous disposition and intense <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> application, his health made frequent changes <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. He returned after a short time to teach <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/02540a.htm">St. Beuno's</a> and subsequently worked on the mission for some years, achieving a high reputation as a preacher. During the last half-dozen years of his life he suffered from prolonged attacks of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> prostration, the malady at times assuming an acute form.

<p>He possessed considerable powers of abstract thought, with a remarkable talent for metaphysical reasoning. Indeed, excessive subtlety impaired his efficiency both as lecturer and writer, leading him to devote disproportionate time and space to obscure ontological questions of minor significance, and consequently to leave unfinished the treatment of more important <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> issues. A vigorous controversialist, he was personally of a most amiable and childlike disposition. His chief literary works were: "Peace through the Truth, or Essays on Subjects connected with Dr. Pusey's Eirenicon", I (London, 1869), II (1874); "The Metaphysics of the School", 3 vols. (London, 1879-1884). In addition to these he published several smaller works in booklet form. Amongst them were the following: "On Modern Principles"; "God the True the Good and the Beautiful"; "Manchester Dialogues"; "Lectures on Papal Infallibility". He also wrote a series of articles on <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> "Grammar of Assent", shortly after its appearance. But the penchant for metaphysical rather than <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> analysis which characterized Harper's mind rendered him not very sympathetic with that remarkable work. Though possessed of considerable literary gifts he adhered to the method rather of anglicizing the scholastic terminology than translating the concept of the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a> into the language of modern <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> literature.
