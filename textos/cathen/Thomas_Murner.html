<h1>Thomas Murner</h1>  

<p>Greatest German satirist of the sixteenth century, b. at Oberehnheim, Alsace, 24 Dec., 1475; d. there, 1537. During the epoch immediately preceding and during the early years of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, three figures are especially prominent among the loyal champions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, namely Johann Geller von Kaysersberg, his friend, Sebastian, the well-known satirist, and Thomas Murner, the ablest and most formidable of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> opponents. In 1481 Murner's <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> people in comfortable circumstances, settled in <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, where his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> practised as an advocate. Thomas, who was of delicate health, entered the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> at the age of sixteen. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, he began his restless and unsettled life, visiting the most celebrated <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> either as a student or as a teacher. He studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, philosophy and mathematics at <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, and law at <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, where he was awarded the degree of bachelor of Theology in 1500. Six years later, when again at <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, he was made Doctor of Theology. In 1518 he graduated Doctor of Laws at Basle. His impulse towards a roving life was due, not only to his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of learning, but also to his mission as a preacher and his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the interests of his order. From 1519 he took part in the controversies which began with the appearance of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> as a reformer. In 1523 he went to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and was cordially received by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, whose book on the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> he had translated into German the previous year. On his return to <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, he found himself compelled to fly before the rebellious peasants and seek refuge at <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>. Here he became the most determined adversary of <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>. Together with <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Dr. Eck</a>, he took part in the religious discussion at <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a> in 1526. When Lucerne was taken in the first War of Kappel (1529), Murner was to have been given up. He managed, however, to escape, and, after many wanderings, was appointed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> in his birth-place, where he spent the rest of his days.

<p>As an author, Murner was at first an enthusiastic friend of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a>. In Cracow he lectured on literary &aelig;sthetics, and in Freiburg on Vergil, whose "&#198;neid" he had translated. In token of gratitude for his appointment as poet-laureate in 1505, he dedicated this translation to Emperor Maximilian. In his "Ludus studentum Friburgensium" (1511),Murner explains the rules of prosody and quantity after the fashion of a game of chess and backgammon. This method he had already employed four years before at Cracow in his "Chartiludium logic&aelig;", but his application of it to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> provoked the derision of the lawyers. His sympathy with <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> did not save him from the resentment of the Alsacian Humanists, when he attacked Wimpfeling's "Germania", which aimed at proving that Alsace had never belonged to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Murner's defence of his position, the "Germania nova", was suppressed by the Strasburg authorities: a further attempt at justifying himself against the attacks of the partisans of Wimpfeling also <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> unsuccessful, and did not prevent his opponents from distorting his name into <em>Murnar</em> (growling fool). Even, in this early controversy, Murner had shown a sharp eye for his opponents' weaknesses, and a marked gift for exposing them to ridicule: in his subsequent writings, he is revealed as a master of satire. Just as <a href="../cathen/06403c.htm">Geiler</a> illustrated his popular sermons with comparisons drawn from everyday life, Murner compares, in his "And&#228;chtige geistliche Badefahrt" (1511), the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to a hydropathic treatment. In "Narrenbeschw&ouml;rung" and "Schelmenzunft" he deals with the same subject as Brant's "Narrenschiff", but his work is entirely original in treatment and far surpasses the earlier work in its popular appeal, its wit, and its vigour&#175;degenerating, indeed, at times into coarseness. His subsequent satires, "G&#228;uchmatt" (Fools' Meadow) and "Die M&uuml;hle von Schwindelsheim und Gretm&uuml;llerin Jahrzeit", in which he severely criticizes a special kind of fools, the "fools of love", form a kind of sequel to the "Schelmenzunft". There is no station, either <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> or lay, that is spared from his castigation.

<p>The appearance of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> diverted Murner's satire into a new course. Regarding the <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at first as a well-intentioned ally in the battle against the evils afflicting the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, Murner addressed to him in 1520 an appeal entitled "Christliche und br&uuml;derliche Ermahnung an den hochgelehrten Doctor Martin Luther", which was followed by other pamphlets refuting and warning him and beseeching him to abandon his ruinous undertaking. In his "Neues Lied vom Untergang des christlichen Glaubens" (1521), Murner gives feeling expression to his sorrow over the destructive tendencies of the religious innovation. But, when the sole effect of his attempts at conciliation was to bring upon him a shower of lies and <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>, Murner dealt <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> a crushing blow in his work, "Von dem grossen Lutherischen Narren wie ihn Doctor Murner beschworen hat". Here Murner rises to heights of satire elsewhere unattained during his whole epoch. All the reformatory endeavours are embodied in the "Great Fool", and the newly-founded church is treated allegorically as <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> daughter Adelheid, who "has a shocking scald-head." Murner wrote many other satires against the reformers, but none which in energy and wit equals this work. This work, so full of fight and honest <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the old Faith, was subjected to much <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> and derision during his lifetime, but was never vanquished in controversy. Later generations did him <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Lessing intended to write a "defence" of Murner, and literary historiographers (especially Kurtz, Vilmar, and G&ouml;deke) have recognized his great importance in the history of literature. Critics have pointed out in his works a peculiar and original metrical and rhythmical system, which distinguished him from all poets of his time. His writings show that he possessed in a conspicuous degree the culture of his age. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> is entertained today of the purity of his intentions and the probity of his character.
