<h1>Thomas Nicholas Burke</h1>  

<p>A celebrated <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> orator, b. 8 September, 1830, in <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a>; d. 2 July, 1882, at Tallaght, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, though in moderate circumstances, gave him a good <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. He was placed at first under the care of the <a href="../cathen/11553a.htm">Patrician Brothers</a>, and was afterwards sent to a private <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. An attack of typhoid fever when he was fourteen years old, and the harrowing scenes of the famine year (1847), had a sobering effect on the quick-witted and studious lad, and turned his thoughts into more serious channels. Toward the end of that year he asked to be received into the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of Preachers</a>, and was sent to <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, to make his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. On 29 December, he was clothed there in the habit of <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> and received the name of Thomas. Shortly afterward he was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to begin his studies in the Convent of the Minerva. He passed thence to the Roman <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Santa Sabina, where he won such esteem by his fervour, regularity, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">cheerfulness</a>, that his superiors sent him, while yet a student, as novice-master to Woodchester, the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the resuscitated English Province. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 26 March, 1853, and on 3 August, 1854, defended publicly the theses <em>in univers&acirc; theologi&acirc;</em>, and took him <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> degree of Lector. Early in the following year Father Burke was recalled to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> to found the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Province at Tallaght, near Dublin. In 1859 he preached his first notable sermon on "Church Music"; it immediately lifted him into fame. Elected Prior of Tallaght in 1863, he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the following year as Rector of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Convent of San Clemente, and attracted great attention in the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a> by his preaching. He returned to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in 1867, and delivered his oration on O'Connell at Glasnevin before fifty thousand people. Bishop Leahy took him as his <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> in 1870, and the following year he was sent as Visitor to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in America. His fame had preceded him, and he was besieged with invitations to preach and lecture. The seats were filled hours before he appeared, and his audiences overflowed the churches and halls in which he lectured. In New York he delivered the discourses in refutation of the English historian Froude. In eighteen months he gave four hundred lectures, exclusive of sermons, the proceeds amounting to nearly $400,000. His mission was a triumph, but the triumph was dearly won, and when he arrived in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> on 7 March, 1873, he was spent and broken. Yet during the next ten years we find him preaching continually in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. He began the erection of the church in Tallaght in 1882, and the following May preached a series of sermons in the new <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> church, London. In June he returned to Tallaght in a dying condition, and preached his last sermon in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> church, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, in aid of the starving children of Donegal. A few days afterwards he breathed forth his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in Whose service he had laboured so valiantly. Father Burke possessed all the qualities of a great orator; a rich, flexible, harmonious voice, great dramatic power, and a vivid <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. He is buried in the church of Tallaght, now a memorial to him. Many of his lectures and sermons were collected and published in various editions in New York, as were also the four lectures in reply to Froude (1872) the latter with the title "The Case of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> Stated".
