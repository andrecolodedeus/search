<h1>Thomas Scott Preston</h1>  

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of New York, prothonotary Apostolic, chancellor, distinguished convert, author, preacher, and administrator born at <a href="../cathen/07144a.htm">Hartford</a>, <a href="../cathen/04253b.htm">Connecticut</a>, 23 July, 1824; died at New York, 4 Nov., 1891. From his youth he was serious, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a>. He studied in the Episcopalian general <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, located at Ninth Avenue and Twentieth Street, New York, where he was recognized as the leader of the High Church party. In 1846 he received <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> orders, and served in this capacity at Trinity Church, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Annunciation in West Fourteenth Street, and at Holy Innocents, West Point. In 1847 he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> by Bishop Delancey of Western New York, his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> having refused to advance him to this order on account of his ritualistic views. He believed himself now a <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">validly ordained priest of the English branch</a> of the One, Holy, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, Apostolic Church, and served for some time at St. Luke's, Hudson Street, New York, hearing <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a> and urging frequent <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>. He was a deep student of the early <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> and of the Fathers, and thus gradually began to feel the branch theory untenable. He was convinced of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a>, as well as of his <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to embrace it, before he had ever read a professedly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> book, or spoken to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on 14 November, 1849. In the autumn of 1850 he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and assigned to <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In 1851 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Yonkers with out-missions at Dobbs Ferry and Tarrytown. In 1853 he became secretary to Archbishop Hughes, and chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He was appointed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Ann's in 1863, and was promoted in 1872 to be <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. During the absence of <a href="../cathen/04395a.htm">Archbishop Corrigan</a> in 1890 he was administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He founded and directed for many years the Sisters of the Divine Compassion. He was a man of exquisite refinement, of tender <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and of intense loyalty. His <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> and <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> conferences attracted multitudes from all parts of the city. His works are: "Reason and Revelation" (New York, 1868); "The Divine Paraclete" (1879); "Ark of the Covenant" (1860) "The Divine Sanctuary" (1887); "Gethsemani (1887); "The Sacred Year" (1885); "Vicar of Christ" (1878); "The Protestant Reformation" (1879); "Protestantism and the Church" (1882); "Protestantism and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>" (1888); "Christian Unity" (1881); "The Watch on Calvary" (1885) "Christ and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>" (1870); "God and Reason" (1884); "Devotion to the Sacred Heart".
