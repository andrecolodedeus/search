<h1>Thomas Stapleton</h1>  

<p>Controversialist, born at Henfield, Sussex, July, 1535; died at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, 12 Oct., 1598. He was the son of William Stapleton, one of the Stapletons of Carlton, Yorkshire. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the Free School, <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, and at New College, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, where he became a fellow, 18 Jan., 1553. On Elizabeth's accession he left <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> rather than conform to the new religion, going first to <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, and afterwards to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, to study <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. In 1563, being in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, he was summoned by the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Barlow to repudiate the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> authority, but refused and was deprived of the <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebend</a> of Woodhorne in Chichester Cathedral, conferred on him in 1558. He then retired to <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> and other relatives. In 1568 he joined Allen at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> and took a great part in founding the English college there, both by lecturing and by devoting to its support his salary as lecturer in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at Anchin College.

<p>His talents were so remarkable that he was soon appointed public professor of divinity, and canon of St. Amatus; and together with Allen he completed the degree of D.D. on 10 July, 1571. In 1584 he resigned these preferments to enter the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, but did not complete his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, and returned to <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>. Philip II appointed him professor of Scripture at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> in 1590, to which office a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> in St. Peter's Church was annexed; and soon after he was made dean of Hilverenbeeck in the Diocese of Boisle-Duc. The emoluments of these offices were all spent in relieving necessitous <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Meanwhile his fame as a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> had spread to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Pope Clement VIII</a> thought so much of his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> writings that he caused them to be read aloud at his table. Twice he invited Stapleton to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in vain, but his offer to make him prothonotary Apostolic in January, 1597, was accepted. It was generally believed that he would be created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, a suggestion which was disapproved of by Father Agazzari, S.J., <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the English College, and obstacles were put in the way of his journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Eley, "Certaine Briefe Notes", p. 254). He accordingly remained at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> till his death in the following year. He left his books and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> (now lost) to the English College at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>. An original <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of Stapleton is preserved at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> Abbey, Woolhampton, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.

<p>His first works were translations: <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Ven. Bede's</a> "History of the Church in England" (Antwerp, 1556), the "Apology of Staphylus" (Antwerp, 1565), and <a href="../cathen/07473a.htm">Hosius</a> on "The Expresse Word of God" (1567). His original works were very numerous: "A Fortress of the Faith" (Antwerp); "A Return of Untruths" (Antwerp, 1566); "A Counterblast to M. Horne's vain blast" (Louvain, 1567); "Orationes funebres" (Antwerp, 1577); "Principiorum fidei doctrinalium demonstratio" (Paris, 1578); "Speculum pravitatis h&aelig;retic&aelig;" (Douai, 1580); "De universa justificationis doctrina" (Paris, 1582); "Tres Thom&aelig;" (Douai, 1588); "Promptuarium morale" in two parts (Antwerp, 1591, 1592); "Promptuarium Catholicum in Evangelia Dominicalia" (Cologne, 1592); "Promptuarium Catholicum in Evangelia Ferialia" (Cologne, 1594) and "Promptuarium Catholicum in Evangelia Festorum" (Cologne, 1592); "Relectio scholastica" (Antwerp, 1592); "Authoritatis Ecclesiastic&aelig; circa S. Scripturarum approbationem defensio" (Antwerp, 1592); "Apologia pro rege Philippo II" (Constance, 1592), published under the punning pseudonym of Didymus Veridicus Henfildanus, i.e. Thomas the Stable-toned [truth-speaking] Henfieldite. "Antidota Evangelica", "Antidota Apostolica contra nostri Temporis H&aelig;reses" (both at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, 1595); "Antidota Apostolica in Epistolam Pauli ad Romanos" (Antwerp, 1595); "Triplicatio inchoata" (Antwerp, 1596); "Antidota Apostolica in duas Epistolas ad Corinthios" (Antwerp, 1598); "Orationes catechetic&aelig;" (Antwerp, 1598); "Vere admiranda, seu de Magnitudine Roman&aelig; Ecclesi&aelig;" (Antwerp, 1599); "Orationes academic&aelig; miscellane&aelig;" (Antwerp, 1602); "Oratio academica" (Mainz, 1608). All his works were republished in four folio volumes in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1620, with an autobiography of the author in Latin verse and Henry <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland's</a> "Vita Thom&aelig; Stapletoni".
