<h1>Thomas Stephens</h1>  

<p>(Also known in India as PADRE ESTEV&Auml;O or ESTEVAM; less familiarly PADRE BUSTEN, BUSTON, or DE BUBSTON)

<p>Born about 1549 at Bulstan, Wiltshire; died in 1619 at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. He is admittedly the first Englishman in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. His father was an influential <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> merchant. Little is known of his boyhood and youth. Though Hakluyt ("Voyages") and Philip Anderson ("The English in Western <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>") believe him to have been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at New College, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, while A. F. Pollard in the "Dictionary of National Biography" identifies him with the Thomas Stephen of Bourton, Dorset, who was elected scholar of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> in 1564, a careful search among the registers of Oxford students gives no evidence of his ever having been at any of the colleges of Oxford. The <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of counting Stephens as an Oxonian may easily have arisen from his name having been mistaken either for that of Richard Stephens his brother, who studied at New College, or for that of another Thomas Stephens who is said to have taken his degree at St. John's College, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, in 1577, when the subject of this article was already a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> at Sant' Andrea's in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Though not a student at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, owing to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> influential position and to his own brilliant parts, he very probably came into familiar contact with <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Edmund Campion</a> and several other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Oxford students whose examples may have influenced his subsequent conversion. Soon after he had finished his scholastic career Stephens attached himself to one <a href="../cathen/12322b.htm">Thomas Pounde</a>. The perusal of the accounts of the Indian Missions seems to have engendered in them the desire of entering the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. Their common aspirations and a similarity of tastes brought the two friends often together during the persecutions of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Finally, impatient of delay in carrying out their spiritual object, they determined to set out for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but <a href="../cathen/12322b.htm">Pounde</a>, betrayed, was doomed to pass the next thirty years in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. Stephens travelled alone to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. Having finished his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, Stephens received permission to proceed to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. He sailed from <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> (4 April, 1579) and reached <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, then the principal city of the East Indies, on 24 October of the same year. From <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> he wrote a series of letters to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, which appear to have held out "the strongest inducements which <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> merchants had been offered to embark on Indian speculations", coming, as they did, from one with a thorough grasp of commercial <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. It has been undoubtedly put forth that these communications on the mercantile chances and possibilities in the East subsequently led to the formation of the East <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> Company; but, unfortunately, only two of the letters have been preserved. One of them (10 November, 1579), the first he wrote to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> on reaching <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, is included in Hakluyt's "Voyages". The other (24 October, 1583), written in Latin to his brother in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, is preserved in part in the National Library of <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, and published by Dr. Gerson da Cunha in the "Instituto Vasco da Gama", II. Fr. Stephens's first five years were spent as minister of the professed house at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of Salsette College, and temporary <em>socius</em> to the visitor. The remaining thirty-five years of his ministry were spent among the Brahmin <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Salsette. His energy and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> won the devotion of the people and his influence often protected travellers, not only his countrymen, but other <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> as well.

<p>In the midst of his missionary labours he found time for considerable literary work, though few of his writings remain. The <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Society of Jesus</a> in 1773 and the checkered career of the Konkani race (the descendants of the Brahmin <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> community of Salsette) destroyed most of his works and renders the drawing up of anything like a complete list impossible. M. Pollard states that Padre Estev&acirc;o was the first to make a scientific study of Canarese, that he also learned Hindustani, and that in both these languages he published manuals of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and grammar. Yet not a single trace of these productions is extant. His greatest surviving work, "The Christian Pur&acirc;nna", shows that he must have acquired a complete mastery of Mar&acirc;thi and Konkani and of Sanskrit, and it is possible to suppose that he must have written more works with the help of these than are preserved to us. The following list includes all the extant writings: the two letters mentioned above; a Catechism of Christian Doctrine which first appeared under the title, "Doutrina Christ&atilde; em lingua Bramana-Canarin, Ordenada a maniera de dialogo para ensinar os meninos, pelo Padre Thomas Estev&atilde;o, Jesuita, no Collegiode Rachol" (1622); "Arte de lingua Canarin", a grammar of the Konkani language, the first grammar of an Indian tongue by a <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a>, chiefly of bibliographical interest (Rachol, 1640), revised and improved by Fr. Diogo Ribiero, S.J., and bearing the <em>imprimatur</em> of the <em>pr&oelig;positus</em> General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, <a href="../cathen/15486d.htm">Fr. Vitelleschi</a>. Only two copies of the first edition are known to exist; a second edition was issued in 1857; "The Christian Pur&acirc;nna" (1616, 1649, and 1654), but no copies of any of these editions are extant. An <em>editio princeps</em>, reproduced from authenticated Manuscript copies by the present writer, was issued in 1907 from the Jesuit Press at <a href="../cathen/09588b.htm">Mangalore</a>, <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. "The Christian Pur&acirc;nna" is a Marathi-Konkani metrical composition, consisting of 10,962 strophes; divided into two parts treating of the Old and the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> respectively.
