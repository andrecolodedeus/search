<h1>Thomas Walsh</h1>  

<p>Born in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, October, 1777; d. there, 18 February, 1849. His father, an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> merchant, having died during his infancy, Thomas was sent by his <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> mother to the grammar <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/13329a.htm">St. Albans</a>. Through his uncle, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the London District, who obtained his admission to the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251a.htm">St. Omer</a>, his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was saved. He shared in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> at Dourlens, and then continued his studies at Old Hall Green, where he was confirmed on 19 December, 1795. When Dr. Stapleton was made <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Midland District, he took Walsh, then <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, as secretary (1801). Walsh continued with <a href="../cathen/10315a.htm">Bishop Milner</a> as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> and missioner at Longbirch until October, 1804, when he was sent to Sedgley Park School as spiritual father. In 1808 he went to Oscott as vice-president and spiritual father and later he became president (1818-26). On 1 May, 1825, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03216a.htm">Cambysopolis</a>, as coadjutor to <a href="../cathen/10315a.htm">Bishop Milner</a>, whom he succeeded as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> on 19 April, 1826. His rule of the district was marked by great progress, both spiritual and material. The College of St. Mary, Oscott, the two <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a> and Nottingham, besides numerous churches and religious foundations, bear witness to the greatness of his ideals and his unwavering <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. From July, 1840, his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> was over the newly-constituted Central District; and on 28 July, 1848, he was translated to the London District, against his own desire. But he was too old and infirm to take any active part in its affairs, and he left its administration in the hands of his coadjutor, <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Bishop Wiseman</a>. Cardinal Barnabo reported the resolve of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> that Walsh should be the first <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of the new <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, in the words "Whether living or dying he shall be the first Archbishop", but death prevented the fulfilment. He is buried in St. Chad's Cathedral, Birmingham.
