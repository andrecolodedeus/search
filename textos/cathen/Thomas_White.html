<h1>Thomas White</h1>  

<p>(<em>Alias</em> BLACKLOW, BLACLOE, ALBIUS, ANGLUS).

<p>Born in Essex, 1593; died in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 6 July, 1676. Through his mother, Mary Plowden who married Richard White of Hutton, Essex, he was grandson of the lawyer, <a href="../cathen/12167b.htm">Edmund Plowden</a>. <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">Educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/11251a.htm">St. Omer</a>, <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on 25 March, 1617; he studied at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, became bachelor of divinity, and returned to <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> to teach <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, which he did, with intervals, till 1630, when he became president of the English College, <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>. In 1633 he resigned and returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where he devoted himself to the writing of about forty works, which caused a bitter <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> controversy. Not only was he accused of employing new expressions and manners of speech not usual in <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic theology</a>, but his views on <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility of the pope</a>, were unsound. Exception was also taken to his politico-religious views, especially his teaching in favour of passive obedience to any established government. Several of White's opinions were censured by the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> in decrees <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 14 May, 1655, and 7 Sept., 1657, and many of his friends and former students publicity disclaimed his principles. Finally, he withdrew the censured opinions and submitted himself and his writings to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. He was chiefly opposed by George Leyburn, the president of <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, and Robert Pugh, the latter of whom wrote a life of him, not known now to exist, also a work called "Blacklo's Cabal", in which he accuses him of opposition to the regulars and to episcopal authority, and disloyalty to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. White, however, counted amongst his friends some of the leading <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, who defended the solidity of his fundamental <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and maintained his loyalty to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, while disclaiming the doctrines to which exception was taken and which he had retracted.
