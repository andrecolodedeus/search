<h1>Thomas William Croke</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, b. near Mallow, Co. <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>, 24 May, 1824; d. at Thurles, 22 July, 1902. His early studies were made at the <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a>, Paris, and his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course was completed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Returning to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> he was made one of the professors at St. Patrick's College, Carlow, and then did mission work at Charleville in his native diocese from 1849 to 1858. They were the years of misery following the great famine, and the suffering of the people from their <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> and political misfortunes intensified the national leanings that were a marked characteristic of his whole career and which made him to his fellow-countrymen the ideal of the patriot <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He was a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> follower of O'Connell in the Repeal Era, and when the prestige of The Liberator waned, sided with the Young <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> party.

<p>Appointed president of St. Coleman's College, Fermoy, in 1858, Dr. Croke administered this office satisfactorily for seven years, followed by five equally successful years as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Doneraile, and was then appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02068a.htm">Auckland</a>, Australia. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/04564a.htm">Cardinal Cullen</a> and took part in the concluding sessions of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. Returning to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> for a brief visit, he went by way of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> to take possession of his <a href="../cathen/02068a.htm">See of Auckland</a>. During the succeeding four years his government of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was marked by great spiritual and material progress. In 1874 Archbishop Leahy of <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a> died, and at the request of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> Bishop Croke was appointed to fill the vacancy. His return to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> gave the greatest satisfaction to the people, who immediately hailed him as the unquestioned and safe <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> leader in national politics that <a href="../cathen/09499a.htm">Archbishop MacHale</a> of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a> had been for the previous generation. He at once resumed his former active interest in political affairs and became a strong supporter of the Home Rule movement under the leadership of Isaac Butt. In the more advanced agrarian projects of the Land League days he was side by side with Charles Stewart Parnell in popular leadership, and was the main restraining influence when the ultra-radical element, infuriated by the new coercion <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of British officialism, broke out with the "No Rent" and other revolutionary manifestos. He made several visits to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in defence of the popular cause and to oppose the attempts of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> diplomacy to enlist the direct intervention of the influence of the Vatican against the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Nationalists, the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of whose efforts he vigorously championed. After the fall of Parnell and the confusion and factional strife that followed he withdrew in a measure from active participation in politics, but never lost his enthusiasm for the cause of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> national regeneration.
