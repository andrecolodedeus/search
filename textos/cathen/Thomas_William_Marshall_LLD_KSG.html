<h1>Thomas William Marshall, LL.D., K.S.G.</h1>  

<p>Controversial writer, b. 1818; d. at Surbiton, Surrey, 14 Dec., 1877. He was son of John Marshall, government agent for colonizing New South Wales. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and he was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a> (Trinity College) where he graduated <a href="../cathen/01756c.htm">B.A.</a> in 1840. Taking <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">orders in the Church of England</a>, he became Vicar of Swallowcliff, in Wiltshire, to which living the Perpetual Curacy of Antstey was attached. Profoundly influenced by the Tractarian movement, he set himself to study the episcopal government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and his first book, published in 1844, was a work on this subject. But in writing this book he was led by his researchers to abandon the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> position as untenable, and in November, 1845, he was received into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/01765c.htm">Lord Arundell's</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> at Wardour Castle. In 1847 he was appointed the first inspector of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Schools, a position which he held until 1860, when he was asked to resign, owing to the public feeling aroused against him by the publication of his pamphlet exposing the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> missions to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. After two years spent in America he returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and published his best known work on "Christian Missions" 1862). In 1870 and the following year he lectured in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> with great success, the <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Jesuit College of Georgetown</a> conferring on him the degree of Doctor of Laws. In 1872 he returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where he devoted himself to literary pursuits for the remaining five years of his life. He married Harriet, daughter of the Rev. William Dansey, Rector of Donhead-St.-Andrew, who joined the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with him and who survived him.

<p>He was a valued contributor to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> press in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and America. His published works are: "Notes on the Episcopal Polity of the Holy Catholic Church" (1844); "Twenty-two Reasons for Entering the Catholic Church" (1846); "Letter to the Rev. Cecil Wray, M.A." (1846); "Christianity in China" (1858); "Tabulated Reports on Roman Catholic Schools inspected in the South and East of England" (1859); "Christian Missions, their Agents, their Method and their Results" (1862; 1863; New York, 1865; London, 1865. Translated into French and German); "Catholic Missions in Southern India to 1865" (1865, written in conjunction with the Rev. W. Strickland, S.J.); "Order and Chaos, a Lecture delivered at Baltimore" (1869); "My Clerical Friends and their Relation to Modern Thought" (1873); "Church Defence: Report of a Conference on the Present Dangers of the Church" (1873); "Protestant Journalism" (1874); "Anglicans of the Day" (1875).
<h2>Arthur Featherstone Marshall, B.A. Oxon.</h2>

<p>A younger brother of Thomas, abandoned his curacy at <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a> to become a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in the early sixties. He was widely known as the author of "The Comedy of Convocation", a satirical brochure exposing the inconsistencies invoked in all three of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> views---High, Low, and Broad Church. His "Old Catholics at Cologne" was hardly less popular during the period immediately following the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> and the defection of <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>. Other controversial works of a light and popular character by this brilliant writer were "Reply to the Bishop of Ripon's Attack on the Catholic Church" and the "Infallibility of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>."
