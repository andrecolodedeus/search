<h1>Thomas Worthington, D.D.</h1>  

<p>Third President of <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai College</a>, b. 1549 at Blainscough Hall, near Wigan, Lancashire; d. at Biddulph Hall, Staffordshire in 1627. A member of an ancient and wealthy <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> which gave many members to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and which suffered greatly for staunchness to the Faith, he studied at Brasenose College, Oxford (1566-70), where he graduated in arts (17 Oct., 1570). In Feb., 1573, he went to <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai College</a> to study <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. He visited in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (Nov., 1575), in order to induce his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, who was an occasional conformist, to remove into foreign parts. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> (6 April, 1577), he remained teaching the Roman <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> till Sept., 1578, and proceeded B. D. at the <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">University of Douai</a> (Jan., 1579). After ten months in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, he returned to <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, accompanied <a href="../cathen/01322b.htm">William (afterwards Cardinal) Allen</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and set out again for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, Jan., 1580. He laboured assiduously and successfully, being especially remembered for his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in instructing the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> poor. In Feb., 1584, when his four nephews, whom he was conveying to <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, were seized at Great Sankey near Warrington, he managed to escape detection, and to elude the vigilance of his enemies until July, when he was betrayed by a young man whom he had befriended, and seized at his lodgings in Islington. The lord treasurer committed him to the Tower, where he was confined in the "pit" for over two months. In Jan., 1585, with twenty other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, he was put aboard ship by the queen's warrant of perpetual banishment, and conveyed to Normandy. For the next two years he expounded <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. Sir William Stanley turned traitor in Jan., 1587, and with his <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> regiment entered the Spanish service; on 27 April Worthington became their <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> at Deventer. He was recalled to <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> on 27 Jan., 1589, to undertake the offices of vice-president and <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>, but resumed his post as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the regiment at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> in July, 1591. He was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> with the doctorate of divinity in 1588 in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at the University of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>.

<p>On the death of Dr. Richard Barrett (30 May, 1599) Worthington was appointed President of <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai College</a> (28 June), by the cardinal protector, chiefly through the influence of <a href="../cathen/11729a.htm">Father Persons</a>, the nominee of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> being rejected. The task to which he was set was a difficult one, and he appears to have lacked strength of character to cope with it. Since the return of the college from <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> in 1593 its embarrassments had continually increased, and this condition reacted upon the discipline. Dr. Worthington himself had in 1596 addressed a memorial to the cardinal protector on the state of the Roman College, in which he calls attention to the decline of <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, which he ascribes to the innovations of Dr. Barrett. His presidency accordingly began with a pontifical visitation of the college, as a result of which new constitutions were drawn up in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It was enacted that not more than sixty <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> be supported on the foundation, that no student be admitted unless fitted to begin rhetoric, and that all students be required to take <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to receive <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacred orders</a> in due season. The protector also agreed to Dr. Worthington's proposal that a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> be appointed ordinary confessor to the students. This was greatly resented by <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. Worthington had made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to follow <a href="../cathen/01322b.htm">Cardinal Allen's</a> guidance, and, after Allen's death, he subjected himself to <a href="../cathen/11729a.htm">Father Persons</a> by a like <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> (29 Dec., 1596). The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> saw the influence of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in every action of the president, and feared a design to hand over the college to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. Confidence was further shaken by Worthington's dismissal of the existing professors, and their replacement by young men who explain their author instead of lecturing. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were hurried to the Mission without adequate preparation or training. The climax was reached after the death of <a href="../cathen/11729a.htm">Father Persons</a> (April, 1610) when Worthington became reconciled to the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a>, to whom he offered his resignation. This was declined, but a conference between three representatives of each met at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> (May, 1612). It petitioned the protector to appoint two of its members to assist the president in reforming the college, but this was met by the protector's "nihil innovandum". This change of policy brought upon Worthington the hostility of the vice-president, Dr. Knatchbull (al. Norton), and of Dr. Singleton, the prefect of studies, and they sent reports derogatory to his conduct and administration to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. There followed another pontifical visitation (Oct.---Nov., 1612), which discovered a truly deplorable condition of affairs. Disunion among the superiors, studies disorganized, discipline relaxed, the buildings out of repair, the appointments deficient, and the finances crippled by a heavy <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>. Complaints were raised by the students about the inefficiency of their professors, the influence of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> confessor, and the interference of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> in the government of the college. As a result Worthington was summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (May, 1613) by the cardinal protector, and Dr. Kellison, for whose assistance in reforming the college he had petitioned, was appointed to succeed him (11 Nov.). Worthington was granted an annual pension of 200 crowns, and appointed an Apostolic notary with a place on the Congregation of the Index. While in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he became a member of the Oratory. In 1616 he returned to the English Mission and worked in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and in Staffordshire. He was made titular <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. Six months before his death he obtained admission into the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, with permission to make his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">noviceship</a> upon the mission.

<p>Dr. Worthington was the author of: "The Rosarie of our Ladie, with other Godlie exercises" (Antwerp, 1600), a Latin translation of which was also published at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> in 1613; "Annotations to the Old Testament" (Douai, 1609-10); "A Catalogue of Martyrs in Englande for the profession of the Catholique faith (1535-1608)" (Douai, 1608); "Catalogus martyrum in Anglia (1570-1612) cum narratione de origine seminariorum, et de missione sacerdotum in Anglia" (Douai, 1614); "Whyte dyed Black" (1615), against the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> Francis White; "An Anker of Christian Doctrine" (Douai <em>vere</em> London, 1622).

<p>The staunchness of Dr. Worthington's four nephews, who were captured at Great Sankey, 12 Feb., 1584 (Thomas aged 16, Robert aged 15, Richard aged 13, and John aged 11), is worthy of perpetual remembrance. Their conflict is recorded in <a href="../cathen/02783a.htm">Bridgewater's</a> "Concertatio" (1594), translated in <a href="../cathen/16041a.htm">Foley</a>, "Records S.J.", II. Blandishment, promises, threats, stripes, brutality, and cunning were in turn applied in order to obtain information from them of the whereabouts of their uncle, and the names and practices of their <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> friends, and to induce them to be present at the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> worship. After some months all effected their escape. Thomas was retaken with his uncle at Islington, and remained a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> in the Gatehouse for upwards of two and a half years. He afterwards went abroad, married a niece of <a href="../cathen/01322b.htm">Cardinal Allen</a>, and died at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> in 1619. Robert reached <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, 22 Sept., 1584, and was joined there by Richard and John on 13 Oct. What they had undergone resulted in the death of Robert, 18 Feb., 1586, and of Richard, 8 June, 1586. John became a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, was the first missioner of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> who settled in Lancashire, and the founder of the extensive Lancashire district; he died on 25 Jan., 1652.
