<h1>Thomas de Lemos</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and controversialist, b. at Rivadavia, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 1555, d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> 23 Aug., 1629. At an early age he entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a> in his native town; he obtained, in 1590 the lectorate in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and was at the same time appointed regent of studies in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Paul at Valladolid. In 1594 he was assigned to the chair of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> of that city. The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> atmosphere of the time was troubled, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> discussion was rife. The controversy aroused in 1588 by the publication of Molina's work "Concordia liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis", between the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, had reached a heated and turbulent stage not only at Valladolid but also at Salamanca, <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>, <a href="../cathen/13468c.htm">Saragossa</a>, and other cities of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The almost daily disputations both public and private, showed a tendency to drift away from the hitherto universally accepted teaching of Augustine and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a>. In 1600 Lemos was chosen to represent his province in the public defence of selected theses before the <a href="../cathen/06412b.htm">general chapter</a> of his order held at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. The propositions embraced the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> and his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> on grace and <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. In his defence Lemos proved himself a disputant of the highest order. His familiarity with the works of St. Augustine on the question under discussion was such that the slightest deviation from them, either in content or in diction, would not pass him uncorrected; and that he was no less familiar with the writings of St. Thomas is evident from his own words: nec nos in Hispania aliis armis nisi armis S. Thomae incaepimus hanc doctrinam impugnare" (Acta Congreg., disp. ii, col. 176). His ability and success prompted the general of his order to send him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to assist his confrere, Father Alvarez, in defending the teaching of his order against the <a href="../cathen/10437a.htm">Molinists</a> before the <a href="../cathen/04238a.htm">Congregatio de Auxiliis</a> established by <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> to settle the controversy.

<p>Upon his arrival he was given first place in the defence, which he held till the termination of the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Congregation</a> (26 Feb., 1606). For four years, in forty-seven public conferences, in the presence of <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>, he defended the teaching of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> with extraordinary skill against five no less able adversaries, the &eacute;lite of the great <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the time. Referring to this event he himself writes: "Fuit ista Congregatio celebris, de qua multi mirati sunt, quod tot ac tantis, ubi fecerunt summum proelium patres Societatis, sic ex tempore fuisset responsum. Sed gratia Dei sum id quod sum" (Acta Congreg., 1231). At the conclusion of the commission, <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Pope Paul V</a> and Philip III of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> offered him a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, but he declined the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, preferring to remain in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> Sopra Minerva to devote himself to literary work. Three years before his death he became totally blind. During his lifetime he published nothing. The work which has given him a permanent and prominent place in the history of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> appeared about fifty years after his death, the "Panoplia gratia seu de rationalis creaturae in finem supernaturalem gratuita divina suavipotente ordinatione, ductu, mediis, liberoque progressu, dissertationes theologicae" (Li&egrave;ge, 1676). The "Acta omnia Congregatioum et disputationum, quae coram SS. Clemente VIII et Panlo V Summis Pontificibus sunt celebratae in causa et controversia illa magna de auxiliis divinae gratiae" (Louvain, 1702) appeared nearly a hundred years after his death. While he is the author of a large number of works, these are the only ones which have thus far been published.
