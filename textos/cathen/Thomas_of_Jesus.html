<h1>Thomas of Jesus</h1>  

<p>(THOMAS DE ANDRADA).

<p>Reformer and preacher, born at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, 1529; died at Sagena, <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a>, 17 April, 1582. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Augustinian Hermits</a> from age of ten, entered the order at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> in 1534, completed his studies at <a href="../cathen/04095b.htm">Coimbra</a>, and was appointed novice-master. In his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for primitive observance he attempted a thorough reform of the order, but the opposition was such that he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to desist. However, the eventual establishment of the Discalced or Reformed Augustinians is attributed to the initiative of Thomas de Andrada (see <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Hermits of St. Augustine</a>). High in favour at Court, Thomas assisted, in 1578, at the death of John III, of which he has left an interesting narrative in a letter still extant.

<p>John's successor, Sebastian, immediately set out on his ill-starred expedition to Africa (see <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">PORTUGAL</a>), and he insisted that Thomas should accompany the forces. The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">Hermit</a> laboured among the soldiery with his accustomed <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> until wounded and taken captive at Alcacer, 1578. A <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> became his master and, first by kindness then by torture, strove to secure his perversion. Into the dungeon where he was confined a faint gleam penetrated for a short period at midday, and by that light, day after day, Thomas composed for the comfort of his fellow-prisoners his great work, <em>Os trabalhos de Jesus</em>, contemplations on the sufferings of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, which have since <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the nourishment and edification of countless <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> ambassador, learning of his pitiable plight, rescued Thomas and placed him under the care of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> merchant. But he begged to be sent on at once to Sagena, where some two thousand of the poorest captives were detained. There he commenced an apostolate which was soon blessed with marvellous fruit; the jail seemed transformed into a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, numbers were saved from apostasy or reconciled, and several of his penitents suffered a glorious <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Meanwhile vigorous efforts were being made to procure his complete liberation, but Thomas declared that, captive or free, he would remain to the end in the service of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> slaves of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>. His enfeebled frame at last succumbed to the combined effects of his sufferings, toils, and austerities. He spent his dying breath in reassuring some poor <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> on the point of apostasy that their ransom would arrive by a certain date if they persevered, as indeed it did.

<p>Since early in the eighteenth century there have been several English editions of Thomas's famous work on the Passion, but the last complete version has long been out of print.
