<h1>Thomas of Strasburg</h1>  

<p>A fourteenth-century scholastic of the Augustinian Order, born, according to some writers, at Hagenau in Alsace, according to others, at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>; died 1357. It was probably at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> that he entered the Augustinian Order, and there he began his career as a teacher. About the year 1341 he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and became famous as a teacher in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. In 1345 he was elected general of his order, a position which he held until his death. As general, he undertook the revision of the constitution of his order, and published the revised <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> under the title "Constitutiones Ordinis Sui". He interested himself also in the promotion of study among the members of his order, and was instrumental in founding at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> in 1351 a <em>studium generale</em>, or <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, for the study of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. His best known work is a commentary on the <em>Books of Sentences</em> of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter the Lombard</a>, published at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> in 1490 (other editions: <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1564 and 1588; Genoa, 1585; Geneva, 1635). He was also the author of sermons, meditations, and letters, still unpublished.

<p>As a teacher and commentator he adhered closely to the doctrines of Giles of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (&AElig;gidius Romanus, or de Columna), who since 1287 had been recognized as the <em>doctor ordinis</em> of the Augustinians. He opposed the innovations of <a href="../cathen/07235b.htm">Henry of Ghent</a> and the abstruse distinctions of the <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotists</a>. For example, on the question of the distinction between the <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">nature of God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02062e.htm">Divine attributes</a>, he taught that there can be no formal distinction, nor any distinction of any kind except by comparison of the external effects of those attributes. Similarly there is, he maintained, no formal distinction between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the Divine <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>; whatever distinction exists among the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> themselves or between the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and the Divine essence is the work of the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. In regard to the origin of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, he maintained that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of creation can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by strict demonstrations, the starting-point of the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> being the fact that the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being unlimited, could not postulate a material as a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> condition of action: just as the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> does not postulate any other being, so the Divine action does not postulate a material on which to act. This refers, however, to creation in general. Whether the material <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> was created in time or with time, or, on the contrary, was created <em>ab aeterno</em>, is a question which, he believed, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> cannot solve without the aid of revelation.
