<h1>Thomas &aacute; Jesu</h1>  

<p>(Diaz Sanchez de Avila).

<p>Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>, writer on <a href="../cathen/14621a.htm">mystical theology</a>, born at Baeza, <a href="../cathen/01465b.htm">Andalusia</a>, 1564; died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 24 (or 27) May, 1627. Son of Don Baltasar de Avila and Dona Teresa de Herrera, he took degrees in the humanities at an unusually early age, applied himself afterwards to the study of Divinity, and in 1583 to that of law at the <a href="../cathen/13392a.htm">University of Salamanca</a>. Having heard one of the professors extol the writings of St. Teresa (as yet unpublished) he procured a copy, the study of which resulted in a determination to embrace her manner of life. He took the habit at Vallodolid, April, 1586, and made his profession in the following year. As a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> he was commissioned to write a ceremonial according to the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> lately introduced into the order, which remained in force until the last century. He filled the post of reader of Divinity at <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, prior at <a href="../cathen/13468c.htm">Saragossa</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Old Castile</a>. At the expiration of his term of office he withdrew to the Desert of Las Batuecas situated in a mountain gorge of difficult access near Alberea. Later he became <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. He himself had been the originator of this peculiar kind of life. The <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> rule was written for <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a>, but the strictly <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">eremitical</a> life, at least on a large scale, being incompatible with the exigencies of modern time, he devised a compromise by restricting the number of such <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> to one for each province, and limiting that of the religious to four permanent ones, and volunteers from other houses who were to reside there only one year at the time. He established the first Desert at Bolarque (New Castile) in 1592, Las Batuecas (<a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Old Castile</a>) during his provincialship, and later on a similar house in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. He was called to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> by <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> who desired to evangelize the Congo States. Unlike the Spanish Congregation of the Order, the Italian had decided on principle to engage in missionary work, and Thomas being noted for his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> was selected for it. The expedition, however, was frustrated, but he, with a view to furthering missionary enterprise, established with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> consent a new branch of the order under the title of Congregation of St. Paul, which was to cultivate exclusively missionary work (22 July, 1608). Both the Spanish and the Italian superiors resented this step on the ground that it might lead to a split in the order; the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> withdrew his approval, and Thomas remained two years under a cloud.

<p>He wrote his large work, "Stimulus missionum" (Rome, 1610), and soon afterward another, "De procuranda salute omnium gentium" (Antwerp, 1613), in which he outlined the organization and functions of a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> congregation with such wisdom that <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a> when instituting <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> in 1622 followed the lines suggested by Thomas. The latter had been sent by <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> to the Low Countries where he was favourably received by the archdukes, and founded <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> (1610), <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> (1611), Cologne (1613), <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> (1613), Lille (1616), <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> (1617), Antwerp (1618), Marlagne (Desert, 1619), <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> (missionary college for the East, and also for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, 1621), and Namur (1622). From 1617 he filled the post of Provincial of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>. While at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> he placed the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Nuns who had come there from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Italian superiors, and assisted them in the establishment of numerous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>. In 1621 he was recalled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as definitor general, and died there three years later in the odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. By order of <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> his writings were collected in two volumes, and were published at Cologne in 1684, while a third volume was never carried through the press. Besides the works already mentioned there are some on subjects connected with his order (its antiquity, Salamanca, 1599; the privileges of the confraternity, 1599, commentaries on various points of the rule, notices of prominent men, etc.). Other works deal with <a href="../cathen/14621a.htm">mystical theology</a>, of which the principal are: "De contemplatione divina", <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, 1620, and "Divinae orationis methodus", <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, 1623. The small treatise "Le meilleure part, ou la Vie contemplative", translated and edited by Berthold-Ignace de St. Anne (Brussels, 1686), is from an unpublished work. In his mystical writing Thomas &aacute; Jesu systematized St. Teresa's teaching on the basis of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, II-II, QQ. clxxi-clxxv.

<p>Not less active than Thomas &aacute; Jesu in helping to establish the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> was Venerable Dominic &aacute; Jesu Maria (Ruzzola), born at Calatajud, 16 May, 1559; died at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 16 February, 1630. At an early age he entered the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Calced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> in his native town where his uncle was prior, and was sent after his profession to Sargasso and Valencia, receiving <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> at <a href="../cathen/14785a.htm">Tortosa</a>. The desire of a stricter life led him to the Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> at Pastrana (1589), who sent him as master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> to <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, and afterward to Alcal&aacute; for his higher studies. He assisted the plague-stricken at <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, and was five years subprior at Valencia. He resigned the priorship of Toledo at the command of Philip III who desired his presence at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. After a short time he withdrew to the Desert of Bolarque. The <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> sent him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where he filled the posts of master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> and prior at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of La Scala. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> entrusted him with a mission to the Viceroy of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> at <a href="../cathen/11419b.htm">Palermo</a>, but would not consent to his permanently absenting himself from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1614 he became <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> general, and three years later general, in which capacity he undertook the <a href="../cathen/15479a.htm">canonical visitation</a> of the northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and founded the Desert of Varazzo near <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, having previously established a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Loano in Liguria. The struggle between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> powers which ultimately developed into the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> having broken out, <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> sent Dominic to Ferdinand II, who was preparing to engage in what was hoped would prove a decisive battle. With a crucifix in his hand and a picture of the Madonna, which had been shamefully mutilated by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, suspended from his neck, he moved among the combatants, animating the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to fight for their Faith and to gain the victory he promised would be theirs. The Battle of Prague provided indeed a signal success (8 Nov., 1620). Dominic continued his journey through <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, (where he assisted Archduke Albert on his deathbed), Paris, and <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, being everywhere hailed as a hero. Back in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> towards the end of 1621 he assisted the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the establishment of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, towards which end he had collected considerable funds during his apostolic journey; he was nominated a member of the Congregation. <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> sent him to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> to bring about a settlement of the differences between the Court of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and the House of <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, but he was taken ill and died, surrounded by the imperial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. His body, partly incorrupt, now rests in the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> church at Unter Doebling near <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. His biographers relate numberless <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> alleged to have been wrought by him during life (for which he was called the Thaumaturgis of his time), and after his death, but until the conclusion of the process of beatification it is impossible to speak of these. He wrote, besides some works which remained in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>: "Senteniae spiratuales" (on <a href="../cathen/14621a.htm">mystical theology</a>), translated into French (Paris, 1623), German, and <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a>; "Argumenta psalmorum" (Rome, 1623); "De protectione B. Virginis" (French translation, Paris, 1645); "Concordia spiritualis" (Spanish translation, Brussels, 1626).
