<h1>Thorney Abbey</h1>  

<p>(i.e. "the isle of thorns", anciently called ANCARIG).

<p>Thorney Abbey, in Cambridgeshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, was for some three centuries the seat of <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxon</a> <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a>, or of <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a> living in community, before it was refounded in 972 for <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> by <a href="../cathen/05555b.htm">Ethelwold</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, with the aid of King Edgar. The founder brought thither the body of <a href="../cathen/02709a.htm">St. Botulph</a> and of other Saxon <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, including, possibly, St. Benet Biscop; and the church, originally dedicated to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> and His Blessed Mother, became known thereafter as St. Mary and <a href="../cathen/02709a.htm">St. Botulph's</a>. The structure built by <a href="../cathen/05555b.htm">Ethelwold</a> stood for a century, and was replaced after the Norman Conquest by a new church 290 feet long, which was finished in 1108. The long series of charters granted to Thorney in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries attests the prosperity of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and the number of its benefactors. In Domesday Book its value is reckoned as equal to that of <a href="../cathen/11756b.htm">Peterborough</a>; and <a href="../cathen/15633d.htm">William of Malmesbury</a> describes it, in the reign of Henry II, as "an image of Paradise", and flourishing in all respects. Of the thirty-eight <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> whose names are recorded, the first was Godeman, and the last Robert Blyth, who was also <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05147a.htm">Down and Connor</a>, in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Blyth and his community of nineteen <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> surrendered the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> to <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> in 1539, receiving a pension in exchange. The buildings and most of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> were granted by Edward VI to John Earl of Bedford, whose <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> still owns them. The original Norman <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> of five bays, with its perpendicular clerestory, remains, and is used as the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church. The choir has disappeared, and the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a> were demolished in 1636, the material being used to fill up the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> arches. The west front, flanked by square turrets with octagonal terminations 100 feet high, and displaying an elaborate screen, with niches containing nine <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> over the west window, is extremely picturesque.
