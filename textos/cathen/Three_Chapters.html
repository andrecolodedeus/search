<h1>Three Chapters</h1>  

<p>The Three chapters (<em>tr&#238;a keph&aacute;laia</em>) were propositions <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizing</a>: (1) the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and writings of <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>; (2) certain writings of <a href="../cathen/14574b.htm">Theodoret of Cyrus</a>; (3) the letter of <a href="../cathen/07614a.htm">Ibas</a> to Maris.

<p>At a very early stage of the controversy the incriminated writings themselves came to be spoken of as the "Three Chapters". In consequence those who refused to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> these writings were said to defend the Three Chapters; and, vice versa, those who <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> them, to condemn the Three Chapters. Thus, that most important work, the "Defensio trium capitulorum" by Facundus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Hermiane, was an attack on the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematization</a> of the writings of Theodore, etc. The history of the controversy may be divided into three periods: the first ending with the arrival of Vigilius at Constantinople; the second with his ratification of the <a href="../cathen/04308b.htm">Second Council of Constantinople</a> in which the Three Chapters were condemned; the third with the final healing of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a> in the West caused by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> ratification of the aforesaid council. We shall treat very cursorily of the second and third periods, referring the reader for fuller details to the articles on the council, <a href="../cathen/11602a.htm">Pelagius I</a>, <a href="../cathen/11603a.htm">Pelagius II</a>, and Vigilius.

<p>At the end of 543 or the beginning of 544 an edict was issued in the name of the Emperor Justinian in which the Three Chapters were <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>. Justinian's purpose was to facilitate the return of the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. These <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> accused the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>, and, when assured that Nestorius was regarded as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, pointed to the writings of his teacher <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, which were quite as incorrect, and yet had never been condemned. They added that Theodoret, the friend and defender of Nestorius, had been restored to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, and that the epistle of Ibas had even been treated as harmless by the council. It was sincerely hoped by Justinian that when grounds of complaint against the council had been removed, the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> might be induced to accept the decisions of the council and the letters of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo</a>, which they now insisted on misinterpreting in a <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> sense. As a temporal ruler he wished to heal religious divisions which threatened the security of the empire, and as a good amateur <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> he was probably rather pleased with himself at being able to lay his finger upon what seemed to him an important omission on the part of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>. But upright as he was, he was really being engineered by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenists</a> who were desirous of escaping his attention. (For Justinian's campaign against the <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenists</a> see XI, 311.) <a href="../cathen/05639b.htm">Evagrius</a> (Hist. eccl., IV, xxviii) tells us that Theodorus Ascidas, the leader of the <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenists</a>, came to Justinian who was consulting about further measures against the <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenists</a>, and raised the question of the Three Chapters to divert the attention of the emperor. According to Liberatus (Breviarium, c. 24) Ascidas wished to take his revenge on the memory of <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, who had written much against <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>; and finding the emperor engaged upon a treatise which was to convert a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> known as the <a href="../cathen/01100c.htm">Acephali</a>, suggested a more expeditious plan. If the writings of Theodore and the epistle of Ibas were <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> being thus revised and expurgated (Synodus &hellip; retractata et expurgata) would no longer be a stumbling block to the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>. The admissions, quoted by Facundus (Def., I, 2; IV, 4), made by <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a>, to Vigilius, tell the same story of an <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenist</a> intrigue.

<p>The leading Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were coerced, after a short resistance, into subscribing. <a href="../cathen/10190a.htm">Mennas</a>, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, first protested that to sign was to condemn the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, and then yielded on the distinct understanding, as he told Stephen the Roman apocrisarius at Constantinople, that his subscription should be returned to him if the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> disapproved of it. Stephen and Dacius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, who was then at Constantinople, broke off communion with him. <a href="../cathen/10190a.htm">Mennas</a> had next to coerce his suffragans. They also yielded, but lodged protests with Stephen to be transmitted to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in which they declared that they acted under compulsion. Ephraim, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>, resisted, then yielded and sent a message to Vigilius, who was in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, affirming that he had signed under compulsion. Zoilus, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and Peter, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, made a like resistance and then yielded (Facundus, "Def.", IV, 4). Of the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> those who subscribed were rewarded, those who refused were deposed or had to "conceal themselves" (Liberatus, "Brev.", 24; Facundus, "Def.", II, 3 and "Cont. Moc.", in <a href="../cathen/06349c.htm">Gallandi</a>, XI, 813). While the resistance of the Greek-speaking <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> collapsed, the Latin, even those like Dacius of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and Facundus, who were then at Constantinople, stood firm. Their general attitude is represented in two letters still extant. The first is from an African <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> named Pontianus, in which he entreats the emperor to withdraw the Three Chapters on the ground that their condemnation struck at Chalcedon. The other is that of the Carthaginian <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, Ferrandus; his opinion as a most learned canonist was asked by the Roman <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> <a href="../cathen/11602a.htm">Pelagius</a> (afterwards <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, at this time a strong defender of the Three Chapters) and Anatolius. He fastened on the epistle of Ibas&mdash;if this was received at <a href="../cathen/03554a.htm">Chalcedon</a>, to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> it now was to condemn the council. An even stronger use of the benevolence of the council towards this epistle was made by Facundus at one of the conferences held by Vigilius before he issued his "Judicatum". He wished it to protect the memory of <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a> because Ibas had spoken of him in terms of commendation (Cont. Moc., loc. cit.). When in January, 547, Vigilius arrived at Constantinople while <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and the countries of Illyricum and Hellas through which he journeyed were up in arms against the condemnation of the Three Chapters, it was clear that the Greek-speaking <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as a whole were not prepared to withstand the emperor.

<p>With regard to the merits of the controversy, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and, in the case of Theodore, very serious ones, were to be found in the incriminated writings (Theodore was practically a <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> before Nestorius); the mistakes of Theodoret and Ibas were chiefly but not wholly due to a misunderstanding of St. Cyril's language. Yet these <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> even when admitted did not make the question of their condemnation an easy one. There were no good precedents for thus dealing harshly with the memory of men who had died in the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, as Facundus argued ("Cont. Moc.", in <a href="../cathen/06349c.htm">Gallandi</a>, X, 815), had <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> about the rebaptism of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, yet no one would dream of <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizing</a> him. The condemnation was not demanded to crush a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, but to conciliate <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who were implacable enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>. Both Ibas and Theodoret had been deprived of their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and had been restored by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> on <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizing</a> Nestorius. Yet the council had their writings before it, and, in the case of the epistle of Ibas, things were said which could easily be construed into an approval of it. All this made the condemnation look like an oblique blow at <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo</a> and Chalcedon.

<p>The matter was further complicated by the fact that the Latins, Vigilius among them, were for the most part <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of Greek and therefore unable to judge the incriminated writings for themselves. <a href="../cathen/11603a.htm">Pelagius II</a> in his third epistle to Elias, probably drawn up by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, ascribes all the trouble to this <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. All they had to go upon was the general attitude of the Fathers of Chalcedon. These facts should be remembered in judging the conduct of Vigilius. He came to Constantinople in a very resolute frame of mind, and his first step was to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> <a href="../cathen/10190a.htm">Mennas</a>. But he must have felt the ground was being cut from under his feet when he was supplied with translations of some of the worst passages in the writings of Theodore. In 548 he issued his "Judicatum" in which the Three Chapters were condemned, and then temporarily withdrew it when the storm it raised showed how ill-prepared the Latins were for it. Next he and Justinian agreed to a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> in which Vigilius pledged himself to bring about the condemnation of the Three Chapters, it being understood that the emperor should take no further steps till the council should be arranged. The emperor broke his pledge by issuing a fresh edict condemning the Chapters. Vigilius had twice to take sanctuary, first in the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Basilica of St. Peter</a>, and then in the Church of St. Euphemia at <a href="../cathen/03554a.htm">Chalcedon</a>, from which he issued an <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> to the whole Church describing the treatment he had received. Then an agreement was patched up and Vigilius agreed to a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> but soon withdrew his assent. Nevertheless, the council was held, and, after refusing to accept the "Constitutum" of Vigilius (see <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">V<font size=-2>IGILIUS,</font> P<font size=-2>OPE</font></a>), it then condemned the Three Chapters. Finally Vigilius succumbed, confirmed the council, and was set free. But he died before reaching <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, leaving his successor <a href="../cathen/11602a.htm">Pelagius</a> the task of dealing with the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a> in the West. The most enduring of these were those of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> and <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. The latter came to an end when Fronto, the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, died about 581.
