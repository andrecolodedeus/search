<h1>Tiberias</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">Titular see</a>, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Scythopolis</a>, in Palaestina Secunda. The town of Tiberias was founded on the <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">lake</a> in A.D. 17 by <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#III">Herod Antipas</a>, tetrarch of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, who gave it the name of the reigning emperor, <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>. As <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> were discovered there at the time of its foundation the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> refused to dwell there, and <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#III">Herod</a> was forced to populate it with foreigners and people of low extraction (Josephus, "Ant. jud., " XVIII, ii, 3). What it was previously called is not known; <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> makes it the site now of Reccath, now of Emath, now of Cenereth or Kinnereth, towns of <a href="../cathen/10749a.htm">Nephthali</a> (<a href="../bible/jos019.htm#vrs35">Joshua 19:35</a>). The town seems to have been a little more than three miles in circumference. Although Tiberias gave its name to the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">lake</a> and is mentioned several times in the Gospels, it seems never to have been dwelt in by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. At the death of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#III">Herod Antipas</a> in 41, <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> gave the town to <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#IV">Herod Agrippa the Younger</a> who made Sephoris or Diocaesarea his capital. At the revolt of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> against the Romans the people of Tiberias sided now with one party, now with the other, and the Jewish historian <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, who was Governor of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, only took it after several attempts ("Bell. jud., " II, xxi, 6; "Vita Josephi," 18 and 54). At the approach of <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> it submitted without resistance and was not disturbed; the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> secured the privilege of dwelling there alone, to the exclusion of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>. Towards the end of the second century the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a> was removed thither from <a href="../cathen/04798b.htm">Sephoris</a> together with the Talmudic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Jamnia, whence issued many celebrated rabbis, among them Juda Hakkodesh, who shortly afterwards codified the vast body of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and customs known as the Mishna. Between 230 and 270 Rabbi Jochanan composed the Gemara, supplement of the Mishna, and these two codes are called the <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> Talmud. In the sixth century the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Tiberias produced the celebrated <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Masorah</a>, or fixed Hebrew text of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. Rabbi Bar Anina of Tiberias gave lessons in Hebrew to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>.

<p>The introduction of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> dates from the time of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>. It was Count Joseph, a Jewish convert of this town living at <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Scythopolis</a>, who built its first church, perhaps on the site of the Hadrianeum (a temple founded by the <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Emperor Hadrian</a> and never completed). Under Constantine also the Jewish patriarch Hillel was converted and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the missionary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who bore the title of Tiberias but resided elsewhere (P.G., XLI, 409-29). Among its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were: John, present at the <a href="../cathen/05495a.htm">Robber Synod of Ephesus</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> in 449 and 451; John II, at the councils of 518 and 536; George, in 553; Basil, in the eighth century (<a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a>, "Oriens christ., " III, 705-10); Theodore, in 808 (Tobler, "Itinerar. hierosolym., " I, 304). Justinian restored the walls of the town (Procopius, "De aedificiis," V, 9). Ancient <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> speak of its <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>. At the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> occupation it was given in fief to Tancred who made it his capital. A new town was built, churches restored, and a Latin <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was instituted, suffragan to <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>. Many of its residential or <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are known (<a href="../cathen/05181b.htm">Du Cange</a>, "Familles d'outre-mer," 807; <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a>, op. cit., III, 1301-04; Eubel, "Hierarchia catholica medii aevi," I, 511; II, 275; III, 333). The Greek see never ceased to exist, but has long been titular. In 1187 after the defeat of Hattin, better known as the battle of Tiberias, the town and fortress fell into the power of Saladin. In 1239 it was given to Eudes de Montbeliard, but five years later the Sultan of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> recovered it and massacred the garrison and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> inhabitants. The last <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> died in 1620 at the passing of Quaresimus, and only <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a> remained. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have since returned. Out of 6500 inhabitants, 4500 are <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, 1600 <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>, 185 Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 35 Latins, 42 Greek Schismatics, and about 20 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> dependent on the Scotch mission which has a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> have a church and an infirmary. The town, called Tabarieh, besides ramparts has only insignificant ruins and is very dirty.
