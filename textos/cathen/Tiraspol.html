<p>DIOCESE OF TIRASPOL (or CHERSONESE) (TIRASPOLENSIS; CHERSONENSIS)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in Southern <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> suffragan of Mohilev, covers the governments of Saratov, Samara, Kherson, Ekaterinoslav, Taurida, and Bessarabia. It is one of the largest <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in the world, and has an area of 462,504 square miles. There are in the diocese 350,000 <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Christians</a>, chiefly the descendants of German colonists, in 100 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, about 40,000 <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in 50 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and over 300 Chaldean <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> for whom there is one <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> number about 210, 60 being <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> lives at Saratov, the capital of the government of the same name. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions are, besides the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at Saratov, which has a <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, an inspector, a <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a>, and five professors; there is also a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for boys at the same place, with three professors. Religious orders are not permitted. For some years the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have had an Apostolic administrator of their own (Sarkis Ter Abrahamian) to whom all <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the whole of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> are subject. In important decisions he is dependent on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tiraspol.

<p>During the second half of the eighteenth century large numbers of German colonists went to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> at the urgent request of the Empress Catherine II. These emigrants were chiefly from <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, Wurtemberg, <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, <a href="../cathen/01341c.htm">Alsace-Lorraine</a>, the Tyrol, and <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>; they settled in the fruitful but uninhabited lands in the southern part of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. The colonies founded by them have retained their German names, as Mannheim, <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, etc. as well as the German language and character. Among the half-million German settlers there were about 180,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who settled in villages of their own, apart from the members of other confessions. These <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> villages were generally in the basin of the Volga and of the Caspian Sea. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were cared for spiritually at first by a few <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who had <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> with them, but these <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> soon succumbed to privations and the unaccustomed climate. After this the Russian Government sent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from the provinces on the Baltic. Alexander I transferred the pastoral care of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colonies to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who came among them in 1803. Unfortunately, the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> from <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> in 1820 put an end to their fruitful labours. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were replaced by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from various Polish <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, chiefly <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, Trinitarians, and <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Vincentians</a>, many of them old, feeble men, and unacquainted with the <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German language</a>. The difference in tongues, the racial antipathy between <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and settlers, and the great distance from the residence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (St. Petersburg) enormously increased the difficulties of spiritual administration. Thus religious conditions grew gradually more and more intolerable. Negotiations between <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and St. Petersburg led finally, in 1847, to a concordat, by which, in addition to several other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, a German <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was established for the colonists of Southern <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, to be suffragan to Mohilev.

<p>Saratov on the right bank of the Volga was settled upon as the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but the diocese received its name from the small town of Tiraspol, which in the fourteenth century had been the capital of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Kherson. Besides its vast extent, the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was also singular on account of the varying nationalities of its inhabitants, who included Germans, French, and Italian colonists, besides Russians, Poles, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, Kirghiz, Circassians, Ossetes, Daghestanians, and other peoples. The Government promised to build a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, an episcopal residence, a building for the episcopal curia, and a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and to provide an endowment of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. In 1850 the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the German <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Ferdinand Helanus Kahn, was installed. The <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> was a <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Pole</a>. The promises of the Government were not fulfilled. On account of age and ill-health the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was unable to correct the existing grievances, nor was he sufficiently energetic to make the Government fulfil its <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>. In 1857 a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was opened, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but in rented and inadequate quarters; the number of German teachers was also insufficient. After Bishop Kahn's death (1864) the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> for eight years, all communication between <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> being at that time suspended. It was not until 1872 that the rectory of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, Franz Xaver Zottmann, was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (b. at Ornbau in the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Diocese of Eichst&auml;tt in 1826). In 1864 he had visited Eichst&auml;tt and there secured some professors for the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>.

<p>Bishop Zottmann laboured by speech, writing, and example, and by extraordinary activity in all directions, for the spiritual, moral, and material improvement of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He collected the money <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to build a suitable <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, obtained a building for the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, and spared no sacrifice to train a capable body of German <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Without abandoning the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he kept on good terms with the Government, and thus could do much that was forbidden to the Polish <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. He could issue pastoral letters in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, undertake journeys for making confirmations and for visitation, arrange collections of money, and even go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where, in 1882, he was the first Russian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to pay homage to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. On account of illness he resigned in 1888, and died in his native city on 12 December, 1901. He had made his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> one of the best organized in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. His work was worthily carried on, after his resignation, by Anton Zerr, who came from a German colony near Odessa, and had been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the Tiraspol <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. Zerr resigned in 1902 on account of ill-health, and was succeeded by Eduard von der Ropp. Scarcely two years had elapsed before von der Ropp was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">See of Vilna</a>. He was followed by the present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Joseph Kessler, b. at Louis, a village of German colonists in the Government of Samara, in 1862; <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 28 October, 1904.
