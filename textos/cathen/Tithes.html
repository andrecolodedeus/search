<h1>Tithes</h1>  

<p>(Anglo-Saxon <em>teotha</em>, a tenth).

<p>Generally defined as "the tenth part of the increase arising from the profits of land and stock, allotted to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> for their support or devoted to <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> or <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable</a> uses". A more radical definition is "the tenth part of all fruits and profits <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> acquired, owed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in recognition of his supreme dominion over <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and to be paid to the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>".

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> of giving tithes reaches back into unknown antiquity. It is mentioned in <a href="../bible/gen014.htm">Genesis 14</a>, without anything to indicate that it was something newly instituted. Just as <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> is there represented as offering tithes of the spoils of the enemy to the royal <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>, so in <a href="../bible/gen028.htm">Genesis 28</a>, <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> is recorded as giving a tithe of all his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">possessions</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>. Under the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Mosaic Law</a> the payment of tithes was made <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Hebrews</a> are commanded to offer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the tenth part of the produce of the fields, of the fruits of the trees, and the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> of oxen and of sheep (<a href="../bible/lev027.htm#vrs30">Leviticus 27:30</a>; <a href="../bible/deu014.htm#vrs22">Deuteronomy 14:22</a>). In <a href="../bible/deu000.htm">Deuteronomy</a> there is a mention not only of an annual tithe, but also of a full tithe to be paid once every three years. While it was to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself that the tithes had to be paid, yet we read (<a href="../bible/num018.htm#vrs21">Numbers 18:21</a>) that He transfers them to His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sacred</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>: "I have given to the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">sons of Levi</a> all the tithes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> for a possession, for the ministry wherewith they serve me in the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of the covenant</a>." In paying the tithe, the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Hebrews</a> divided the annual harvest into ten parts, one of which was given to the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> after the first-fruits had been subtracted. This was partitioned by them among the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The remainder of the harvest was then divided into ten new parts, and a second tithe was carried by the head of the household to the sanctuary to serve as a sacred feast for his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>.

<p>If the journey to the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> was unusually long, money could be substituted for the offering in kind. At the triennial tithe, a third decimation was made and a tenth part was consumed at home by the householder with his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, strangers, and the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>. This triennial year was called the year of tithes (<a href="../bible/deu026.htm#vrs12">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>). As the tithes were the main support of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, it was later <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> that the offerings should be stored in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> (<a href="../bible/2ch031.htm#vrs11">2 Chronicles 31:11</a>). It is to be noted that the <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> of paying sacred tithes was not peculiar to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, but common to all ancient peoples. In Lydia a tithe of cattle was offered to the gods; the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabians</a> paid a tithe of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> to the god Sabis; and the Carthaginians brought tithes to Melkarth, the god of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>. The explanation of why the tenth part should have been chosen among so many different peoples is said to be (apart from a common primitive <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>) that <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystical</a> signification of the <a href="../cathen/11151a.htm">number</a> ten, viz., that it signifies totality, for it contains all the <a href="../cathen/11151a.htm">numbers</a> that make up the numerical system, and indeed all imaginable series of <a href="../cathen/11151a.htm">numbers</a>, and so it represents all kinds of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, which is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift of God</a>. All species of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> were consequently reckoned in decades, and by <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> one of these parts to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the proprietor recognized the Source of his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">goods</a>. However, the payment of tithes was also a civil custom. They were payable to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Hebrew</a> kings and to the rulers of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, and they are mentioned among the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greeks</a>, Romans, and later the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>, as those who serve the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a> should live by the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a> (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs13">1 Corinthians 9:13</a>), provision of some kind had necessarily to be made for the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sacred</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>. In the beginning this was supplied by the spontaneous offerings of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. In the course of time, however, as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> expanded and various institutions arose, it became necessary to make <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which would insure the proper and permanent support of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The payment of tithes was adopted from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Law</a>, and early writers speak of it as a <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">divine ordinance</a> and an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. The earliest positive legislation on the subject seems to be contained in the letter of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> in 567 and the <a href="../cathen/03287a.htm">canons</a> of the Council of Ma&ccedil;on in 585. In course of time, we find the payment of tithes made <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> by ecclesiastical enactments in all the countries of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">christendom</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> looked on this payment as "of <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">divine law</a>, since tithes were instituted not by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> but by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> Himself" (C. 14, X de decim. III, 30). As regards the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Roman emperors granted the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to churches of retaining a portion of the produce of certain lands, but the earliest instance of the enforcement of the payment of ecclesiastical tithes by <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> is to be found in the capitularies of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, at the end of the eighth century. <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> law very early recognized the tithe, as in the reigns of Athelstan, Edgar, and <a href="../cathen/03306c.htm">Canute</a> before the Norman Conquest. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> statute <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> proper, however, the first mention of tithes is to be found in the Statute of Westminister of 1285. Tithes are of three kinds: predial, or that derived from the annual crops; mixed, or what arises from things nourished by the land, as cattle, milk, cheese, wool; and personal or the result of industry or occupation. Predial tithes were generally called great tithes, and mixed and personal tithes, small tithes. Natural substances having no annual increase are not tithable, nor are wild animals. When <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> is inherited or donated, it is not subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of tithes, but its natural increase is. There are many exempted from the paying of tithes: spiritual corporations, the owners of uncultivated lands, those who have acquired lawful <a href="../cathen/12395b.htm">prescription</a>, or have obtained a legal renunciation, or received a <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.

<p>At first, the tithe was payable to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but later the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> passed by common law to <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Abuses soon crept in. The <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to receive tithes was granted to princes and nobles, even hereditarily, by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> in return for protection or eminent services, and this species of impropriation became so intolerable that the <a href="../cathen/09017b.htm">Third Council of Lateran</a> (1179) decreed that no alienation of tithes to <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> was permissible without the <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In the time of <a href="../cathen/06795a.htm">Gregory VIII</a>, a so-called Saladin tithe was instituted, which was payable by all who did not take part personally in the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> to recover the Holy Land. At the present time, in most countries where some species of tithes still exist, as in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (for the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Established Church</a>), in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the payment has been changed into a rent-charge. In English-speaking countries generally, as far as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are concerned, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> receive no tithes. As a consequence, other means have had to be adopted to support the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and maintain the ecclesiastical institutions (see <a href="../cathen/03761b.htm">CHURCH MAINTENANCE</a>), and to substitute other equivalent payments in lieu of tithes. Soglia (Institut, Canon, II, 12) says "The law of tithes can never be abrogated by <a href="../cathen/12395b.htm">prescription</a> or <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a>, if the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> have no suitable and sufficient provision from other sources; because then the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural</a> and <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">divine law</a>, which can neither be abrogated not antiquate, commands that the tithe be paid." In some parts of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, the tithe is still recognized by <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, and the Fourth Council of Quebec (1868) declared that its payment is binding in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>.
