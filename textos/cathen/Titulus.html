<h1>Titulus</h1>  

<p>In <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> times <em>titulus</em> signified an inscription on stone, and later the stone which marked the confines of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. Under <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> it signified at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the limits of the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, which is the germ of the meaning it bears in its ecclesiatico-archeological usage. <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> explains that a cross sculptured on a church was the <em>titulus</em> which designated it as belonging to Christ, just as imperial <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was indicated by the <em>titulus fiscalis</em>. Nothing remains to establish with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> where the public <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> edifice of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> before Constantine were situated. The earliest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> assembled in the halls of private houses, and these <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> were therefore called <em>ecclesiae domesticae</em>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> mentioned those at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Corinth; in accordance with the most ancient Roman traditions, they were those of Aquilla and Prisca on the Aventine and the Ecclesia Pudentianae on the Viminal. These <em>ecclesiae domesticae</em> became the <em>domus ecclesiae</em>, and later <em>domus Dei</em>, i.e. the <em>dominicum</em>; and in this last period they received the name <em>tituli</em>, from the name of the founder or proprietor who held the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in custody for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. A populous <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community, like that of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, by the end of the third century must have possessed a <em>domus Dei</em>, a social centre which served as church, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> residence, refectory, dispensary of charity, hospice, tribunal, and seat of the episcopal government, as was the case at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, <a href="../cathen/04295a.htm">Cirta</a>, and elsewhere. In the fourth century all this was located at the Lateran, in the palace formerly belonging to Fausta, daughter of <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Maximianus</a>. The history of the Lateran begins with A.D. 313 and the most recent excavations there have revealed six Roman public and private edifices, but no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> buildings earlier than Constantine. According to de Rossi the centre of episcopal administration before the Lateran was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> building at San Lorenzo in Damaso, where in the fourth century the archives of the church were kept, and where now the central chancery (<em>Cancellaria Apostolica</em>) of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal</a> government is situated.

<p>According to the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">Liber Pontificalis</a>, Pope Fabian about 250 divided the regions of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> among the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, creating <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> districts. Probably these districts were provided with an edifice which was the centre of administration and served that purpose for several centuries after Constantine, although no traces of such buildings survive. The <em>diaconiae</em> of the seventh century had nothing to do with these diaconal districts. In the fourth century, although the <em>domus Lateranensis</em> was the chief <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> edifice of the city, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> possessed several places of assembly for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community, which Ammianus Marcellinus calls <em>conventicula christianorum</em>. In time the unity of the presbyterium was broken and other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> groups were created within the city, similar to the present city <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> independent of one another and dependent on a common centre, under the direction of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> permanently appointed. To each one a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> was assigned, <em>dominicum domus Dei</em>; the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> resided near this edifice, which in the language of archaeology is called <em>titulus</em>. The most ancient text which alludes to a titulus is the apology of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> (xx). The most ancient inscription relating to a titulus goes back to A.D. 377. The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">Liber Pontificalis</a> attributes the foundation of the tituli to different <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of the first half of the fourth century, and this information, which seems genuine, is in part confirmed by inscriptions and by the names given to the churches. The <em>tituli presbyterales</em> therefore go back to the <a href="../cathen/16066a.htm">peace of the Church</a>; they were not founded all at one time, but followed the progress of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> propaganda among the people of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. At the close of the fifth century there were twenty-five tituli; the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">Liber Pontificalis</a> confirms this number and attributes their foundation to Pope Evaristus at the beginning of the second century. The last titulus recorder in the Liber is that of Vestina under <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a>. The report of the Council of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1 March, 499), contains the list of the names of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and their tituli. From this and from the report of a council held by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> in 595, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> there were twenty-five tituli, which number, with few fluctuations, remained the same until about 1120 when it is given as twenty-eight. Three of four of the Gregorian tituli do not appear in the list of the council of 499, while the list of Pope Symmachus gives five which are not found in the council of 595. This difference is explained by establishing the location and the surroundings of the disputed tituli and identifying the tituli of Pope Symmachus with those of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope Gregory</a>. The titular churches are all found at a distance from the classic centre of the City, and correspond to an epoch in which <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> preponderated at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. From the studies made and from existing monuments it is safe to attribute the foundation of many tituli to the third century and of most of them to the fourth.

<p>After the presbyteral tituli came the <em>diaconiae</em>; these are not found in Roman documents before the seventh century. The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">Liber Pontificalis</a> mentions them for the first time in the life of <a href="../cathen/02427d.htm">Benedict II</a> (684-85). From the beginning the <em>diaconiae</em> were <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>, and in a measure replaced for the Romans the <em>frumentatio</em> of Byzantine times and the doles of bread of the best days of the empire. They were established in the centre of the city, with the materials, or on the site of, public edifices in a period when there was no longer a motive for building <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> churches away from the Forum or the Palatine. Under Pope Adrian (772-95) their number was fixed at eighteen. From the beginning of the twelfth century <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">cardinal deacons</a> adopted the names of their <em>diaconiae</em> and the number of eighteen was maintained until the sixteenth century. By the twelfth century <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">cardinal deacons</a> as well as the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">presbyters</a> had long been dispensed from personal service at the tituli, since which time titulus of itself acquired a meaning analogous to that of the present time.
