<h1>Titus</h1>  

<p>Roman Emperor 79-81, b. 30 Dec., 41; d. 13 Sept., 81; son of the <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Emperor Vespasian</a>, and from the year 70 C&aelig;sar and coregent; he was highly <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> and a brilliant poet and orator in both Latin and Greek. He won military fame in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in the years 69-70, against the revolted <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. In April, 70, he appeared before the walls of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and conquered and destroyed the city after a siege of five months. He wished to preserve the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple</a>, but in the struggle with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who rushed out of it a soldier threw a brand into the building. The siege and taking of the city were accompanied by barbarous cruelties. The next year Titus celebrated his victory by a triumph; to increase the fame of the Flavian dynasty the <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">inscription</a> on the triumphal <a href="../cathen/01688a.htm">arch</a> represented the overthrow of the helpless people as an heroic achievement. The historical significance of the destruction of the Jewish state is that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have since then been scattered among foreign nations. As ruler Titus was by no means popular; he shared in the voluptuousness of the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> of that era, and was responsible for the acts of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> which occurred during the administration of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. Consequently an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> reign was expected. However, in the short period of his independent authority, Titus agreeably disappointed these anticipations. His noble benevolence was exhibited in the saying that the day was lost in which he had done no one a kindness; he gained the honourable title of "amor et delici&aelig; generis humani" (the darling and admiration of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>). During his reign <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> suffered from two severe calamities. On 24 Aug., 79, the celebrated eruption of Vesuvius buried the cities of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Stabi&aelig;, and some months later a fearful conflagration did great damage at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On both occasions Titus showed a fine humanitarianism. His actions were not free from ostentation and seeking after effect. He died from the effects of his luxurious life.
