<h1>Titus, Bishop of Bostra</h1>  

<p>Born about 362-371. <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> (<a href="../fathers/26023.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.14</a>) names Titus among the great men of the time of Constantius; he also tells (op. cit., V, xv) of a mean trick played upon Titus by <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a>. It was expected that the re-establishment of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> would occasion riots in Bostra as it had elsewhere. <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a> wrote to Titus that he would hold him and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> responsible for any outbreak. Titus replied that though the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were equal in number to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> they would obey him and keep quiet. <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a> then wrote to the Bostrians urging them to expel Titus because he had <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniated</a> them by attributing their quiet conduct not to their own good dispositions but to his influence. According to <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> (op. cit., III, xxv) Titus was one of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who signed the Synodal Letter, addressed to Jovian by the Council held at Antioch (363), in which the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a> was accepted, not, however, without a clause "intended somewhat to weaken and semiarianize the expression <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousios</a></em>" (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, "Councils", II, p. 283; ANTIOCH: <em>Synods of Antioch</em>). <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (Ep. lxx) names Titus among writers whose secular erudition is as marvellous as their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Scripture; in his <a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 102</a>, he speaks of his "mighty" (<em>fortes</em>) books against the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaean</a> and <em>nonnulla alia</em>. He places his death under <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a>. Of the <em>nonnulla alia</em> only fragments of <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> writings have survived. These show that Titus followed the Antiochene School of Scripture <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> in keeping to the literal as opposed to the allegorical interpretation. The "Contra Manich&aelig;os" is the most important work of the kind that has come down to us, and its historical value is very great because of the number of quotations it contains from <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaean</a> writers. In one passage Titus seems to favour <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> view that the pains of the damned are not eternal (on this point see especially <a href="../cathen/03476b.htm">Ceillier</a>, "Histoire g&eacute;n&eacute;rale des auteurs sacr&eacute;s et eccl&eacute;siastiques", VI p. 54, who seems disposed to acquit him of this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>). The work consists of four books of which the fourth and the greater part of the third are only extant in a Syriac translation.

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The Greek and Syriac texts of the Contra Manich. were published by LAGARDE (Berlin, 1859). Earlier editions of the Greek text suffer from an insertion from a work of Serapion owing to the misplacement of a leaf in the original codex. For Contra Manich. and other writings attributed to TITUS see MIGNE and GALLANDI. The genuine exegetical fragments of this commentary were published by SICKENBERGER in Texte u. Untersuchen, VI, i (new series). BARDENHEWER-SHARAN, Patrology (St. Louis, 1908), 270-1.</p></div>
