<p>DIOCESE OF TIVOLI (TIBURTINA)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in the Province of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The city in situated where the Anio, issuing from the Sabine hills, leaps down from a height of nearly 300 feet and enters the Roman Campagna. The water power of the beautiful falls, which attract many tourists to the city, is utilised in various industries and supplies the electric current that lights <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The slopes of the neighbouring hills are covered with olives, vineyards and gardens; the most important local industry is the manufacture of paper. The great cascade has existed only since 1835, when the Gregorian tunnel through Monte Catillo was completed, to give an outlet to the waters of the Anio sufficient to preserve the city from inundation. The "Grotto of Neptune" and the "Cascatelle" are ancient. There are ruins of two old <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>, one of Hercules Saxanus, commonly called "of the Sybil", the other of Tibutus, both overlooking the great cascade. Near the Roman gate is the "Tempio della Tosse". Among the more important churches are the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the Ges(x), S. Maria Maggiore, and S. Maria degli Olivi, containing interesting fifteenth-century frescoes; also S. Maria di Quintiliolo, built on the ruins of the villa of Quintilius Varus. In the environs are many ruins of ancient villas, the largest being the famous construction of the <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Emperor Hadrian</a>, which comprised a villa, portico, theatre, gardens, baths, <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, etc., and covered 173 acres of ground. Many of the treasures of the Vatican Museum were discovered here. The most notable of the modern villas are the Villa d'Este (1549), and decorated with frescoes by Zuccaro; at present it belongs to the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>.

<p>According to some of the ancient writers, Tivoli was founded by the Siculi; according to others, by a colony of Argives. It is first mentioned in Roman history in 493, as included in the alliance against the Volscians, but in 361 it sided with the Gauls against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; though twice conquered, it shortly afterwards (339) allied itself with Praeneste (<a href="../cathen/11421a.htm">Palestrina</a>); for some time it was in the Confederation and in the Social War became a <em>municipium</em>. It was strongly fortified by Belisarius in the Gothic War, but almost destroyed by Totila in A.D. 340. After the Lombard invasion it was in the power of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> and formed part of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">patrimony of St. Peter</a>. It had a count, representing the emperor. In 916 <a href="../cathen/08425b.htm">Pope John X</a> won a memorable victory there over the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">middle ages</a> it rebelled at times against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, under Henry IV and V, and against <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a>; at other times it fought against the Roman rebels, as under <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugene III</a> and <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a>. In the thirteenth century the Senate of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> succeeded (under <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>) in imposing a tribute on the city, and arrogated to itself the right of appointing a count to govern it in conjunction with the local consuls. In the fourteenth century it sided with the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a> and strongly supported <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a> against <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a>. King Ladislaus was twice, and later Braccio da Montone once, repulsed from the city. But its strength was undermined by internal factions, in consequence of which <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> constructed the fortress which still exists. <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> withdrew it from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Roman Senate. In 1527 it was sacked by bands of the supporters of the emperor and the Colonna, important archives being destroyed during the attack. In 1547 it was again occupied by the Duke of Alba in a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>, and in 1744 by the Austrians.

<p>Tivoli is the birthplace of St. Severinus (sixth century), of Popes St. Simplicius and <a href="../cathen/08425a.htm">John IX</a>, also of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> and musician Golia. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Tivoli counts many <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, among them St. Getulius, <a href="../cathen/14379a.htm">St. Symphorosa</a> with her seven sons, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in the days of Hadrian; at a later period a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> was erected over the place of their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were Vincentius, Majorius and Generosus. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> St. Cletus was later confounded with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of that name, really St. Anacletus. The first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Candidus (465); among his successors were: Gaulterus (1000), under whom the feast of <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>, patron of the city, was instituted; Otto (1148), during whose <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a> <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> died at Tivoli; Giovanni da Gabenna O. P. (1337), who died in the odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>; Filippo de' Rufini, O. P. (1367), sent by the Romans to <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> to induce him to return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; Fra Lorenzo, O. M. (1450), reformer of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; Cardinal Giulio Roma (1634), restorer of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and founder of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; Cardinal Marcello di Santacroce (1652), who completed the work of his predecessor; Gregorio Barnaba Chiaramonti (1782), afterwards <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In the process of concentrating the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> the course of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at Tivoli was suppressed. There are: 42 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; 40,000 inhabitants; 69 secular and 35 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular priests</a>; 11 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of male religious and 6 of sisters; 1 college for boys, and 1 for girls.
