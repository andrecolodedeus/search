<h1>To the Knights of Columbus and Their Friends</h1>  

<p>In taking under our auspices a special edition of T<font size=-2>HE</font> C<font size=-2>ATHOLIC</font> E<font size=-2>NCYCLOPEDIA</font>, we are actuated by the motive which originally inspired the production of this work.

<p>From the start, as the Preface to Volume I declares, it was determined that this encyclopedia should not be exclusively a Church publication, containing only matters of special interest to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. It is intended for the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> as well as for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; and, consequently, it contains all that he needs to know, treated from his point of view.

<p>The Editor-in-Chief and the Managing Editor are <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, as were fully 500 of the contributors, and 150 editorial assistants. With them the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> editors and contributors have co-operated in full appreciation of the importance of producing a work which in content and style would satisfy the scholar in his study and yet interest the man in the street.

<p>For this Encyclopedia is designed to be the starting-point of a movement among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, a great <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> movement in every <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> home in the land, the source of a literature that will once more as in the days before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> employ the English tongue in the cause of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. It is verily an <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> and literary crusade, and as such it must appeal strongly to every member of an Order whose members, in the words of Archbishop Ireland, "aim to be the trusted auxiliaries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, her organized chivalry, ever first and foremost when her call is heard, or her banner leads".

<p>We have but lately completed our achievement of providing for the <a href="../cathen/03455a.htm">Catholic University of America</a> the half million dollar scholarship foundation which is to enable <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> young men from every part of the land to take advantage of the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> facilities of that great institution.

<p>Here is an offer which brings all the advantages that The Catholic University can at present afford and more right into our own homes. T<font size=-2>HE</font> C<font size=-2>ATHOLIC</font> E<font size=-2>NCYCLOPEDIA</font> is a veritable Catholic Home University. It has been truly styled "a university in print". Few, if any, of our membership, are in a position to take advantage of the <a href="../cathen/03455a.htm">Catholic University</a> foundation; scarcely one is unable to avail himself of an offer, which brings to every <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> home the best the University can give.

<p>As if divining that the <a href="../cathen/08670c.htm">Knights of Columbus</a> would take on themselves the task of giving the widest possible circulation to T<font size=-2>HE</font> C<font size=-2>ATHOLIC</font> E<font size=-2>NCYCLOPEDIA</font>, His Grace, Archbishop Ireland, discoursing on "The Typical Catholic Layman of America", before the Supreme Council of the Order lately assembled in <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, recommended the work in the following eloquent terms:

<p>"An intelligent <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> is the prime need of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> today, in America. The battle is opened. It is a flood of contradiction, of misrepresentation, of <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>. <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">History</a> is perverted; Catholic discipline is travestied. When the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as seen daily, cannot with be assailed, the appeal is to centuries of long ago, more unfamiliar to the reader &#151; to remote lands whence no contradiction may come. The remedy is intelligence of all important matters concerning the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at home and abroad, intelligence that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> be guarded from poisonous inoculation, and be, at the same time, in a position to influence public opinion in favor of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. The most ready arm is the press: hence the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the hour is to give generous support to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> newspaper, to read it, to distribute it, supplementing it, as occasion permits, with magazine and book. One book, the summary of thousands, I especially recommend, T<font size=-2>HE</font> C<font size=-2>ATHOLIC</font> E<font size=-2>NCYCLOPEDIA</font>".
