<h1>Toledo (Ohio)</h1>  

<h2>(Toletana in America)</h2>

<p>A <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> formed out of the <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Diocese of Cleveland</a> and erected into a separate <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, 15 April, 1910. It includes the Counties of Lucas (Toledo), Allen, Crawford, Defiance, Fulton, Hancock, Henry, <a href="../cathen/11352a.htm">Ottawa</a>, Paulding, Putnum, Sandusky, Seneca, Van Wert, Williams, Wood, and Wyandot; an area of 6969 sq. miles. The principal towns are <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a>, Tiffin, Fremont, Defiance, and Delphos. Estimated <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, 125,000.

<p>There are 86 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 25 missions, 95 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 31 of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The number of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> is 65, with an enrolment of 13,500. One college (<a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>) and three academy-colleges provide the departments for higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>.

<p>The work of charity and reform is supplied by three <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, two <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, on home for the aged <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and one house of the Good Shepherd.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>The country bordering on Lake Erie was in the path of missioners and trading explorers, who, in the seventeenth century, made their way from Quebec to the upper Great Lakes. French settlers ventured down from <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, and a French fort was established on the Maumee in 1680. Traders followed this river to its source in <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, whence it was not difficult to reach the more important posts about Vincennes. The lake shore would also have been the natural route for the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>, who, in the latter half of the eighteenth century, journeyed from <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a> to visit the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a>, and Father Pierre-Joseph de Bonn&eacute;camps, returned to the north with C&eacute;loron's company from the expedition to the Ohio, entered Lake Erie on the way to <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, at the mouth of the Maumee (Miami of the Lake), 5 Oct., 1749.

<p>Bishop Fenwick, writing to <a href="../cathen/02200b.htm">Father Badin</a> in August, 1823 ("Catholic <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>" in "U.S. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Magazine"), speaks of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indians along the Seneca River who crossed to Malden and Sandwich in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> for marriage and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Father Edmund Burke, who signs himself, "Vicaire g&eacute;n&eacute;ral du Haut Canada", and was stationed near the present Monroe (Frenchtown), <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, in 1794, visited, not Fort Meigs, as has been asserted, but Fort Miami, at the rapids of the Maumee; and in 1825 Bishop Fenwick's <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, Father Gabriel Richard, who as early as 1806 had attended Monroe from <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, indicated that the district "de la Bai Miamy" was considered as one with that of St-Antoine on the River Raisin. This can be more easily understood, if we remember that the territory of <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a> for a long time laid claim to lands in which Toledo is now located.

<p>Even after <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a> had become a separate <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the Rev. P. Carabin, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> at Monroe, enumerates many on his lists as "inhabitants of Toledo" (1837).

<p>The building of water-ways along the line of the Maumee River from the Ohio and the Wabash to Lake Erie did much to open up the country to German and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> immigrants invited by Bishops Fenwick and <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">Purcell</a>, of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, to avail themselves of the opportunities of labour and farming.

<p>After 1830 organized congregations began to take the place of scattered missions, and a resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> was placed at St. Mary's, Tiffin, in 1831.

<p>In 1841 Rev. Amadeus Rappe organized <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis De Sale's</a> Parish, Toledo, of which he was <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> until his appointment as first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a> in 1847. Associated with him and succeeding him in this pastorate was Rev. Louis de Goesbriand, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03081b.htm">Burlington</a>, Vermont. Among the pioneer <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of this section were Fathers <a href="../cathen/02200b.htm">Badin</a>, Ignatius Mullon, Edward T. Collins, Projectus J. Macheboeuf. (afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04733c.htm">Denver</a>), E. Thienpont, and Henry Damien Juncker (later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01367c.htm">Alton</a>), men eminent for learning as well as <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; and these had the co-operation of the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a> and Sanguinist Fathers, under the leadership respectively of Father Tschenhens (1832) and <a href="../cathen/03012a.htm">Father Francis de Sales Brunner</a> (1844). Members of the latter congregation (C.PP.S.), which was introduced by <a href="../cathen/03012a.htm">Father Brunner</a>, are still (1912) in charge of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and missions in the Diocese of Toledo.

<p>The growth of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> was particularly noticeable in the city of Toledo. At the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of its erection into an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> there were within the city twenty <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. This rapid increase had been greatly promoted by a steady influx after 1870 of Poles and Hungarians, employed largely in factories, quarries, and public works.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> prominent in Toledo in this period of development were: the Rt. Rev. F. M.  Boff (1859), who in 1872 was made <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a> and held the unique distinction of having served as administrator of that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> not less than six times in a period of forty years (d. 22 March, 1912); Father Edward Hannin (1863), who was administrator of the <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Diocese of Cleveland</a> from the resignation of the Bishop Rappe to the appointment of Bishop Gilmour, and who when over seventy years of age undertook the building of one of the finest church edifices in the Middle West; and Rev. Patrick F. Quigley, whose widely-noticed action against state interference in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, in the matter of reports and truancy, gave occasion for much hostile demonstration, especially on the part of members of the A.P.A. This <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> contention before the several courts was ably if not successfully maintained by the Hon. Frank H. Hurd, a convert to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and a congressman, celebrated for his convincing advocacy of free trade.

<p>The commercial advantages of the city and the numerical strength of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had long drawn attention to Toledo; and on the death of Bishop Horstmann (1908) the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Province of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> recommended to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> the division of the <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Diocese of Cleveland</a>. The request was favourably considered, and Toledo was named as the seat of the new diocese, with <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales's</a> designated as its <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>. Rt. Rev. John P. Farrelly, D.D., who had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>, 1 May, 1909, was appointed temporary administrator. Rt. Rev. Joseph Schrembs, D.D., first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was born at Wuzelhofen, near <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, 12 March, 1866. Following his elder brother, Rudesind, who had become a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at St. Vincent's, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, he came to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in 1877.

<p>He completed his course of humanities when but 16 years of age at St. Vincent's college, near Pittsburg. After a few years spent in teaching, he was accepted by Bishop Richter as a student for the <a href="../cathen/06726a.htm">Diocese of Grand Rapids</a>, and entered the Seminary of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> in 1884. On 29 June, 1889, Rev. Mr. Schrembs was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/06726a.htm">Grand Rapids</a>. He was successively assistant and <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> at St. Mary's Church, <a href="../cathen/06726a.htm">Grand Rapids</a>, Oct., 1900. In 1903 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> on the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and was named domestic <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, Jan., 1906. Meantime he had brought about the establishment of a high school in <a href="../cathen/06726a.htm">Grand Rapids</a>, thus demonstrating the feasibility of intermediate grades for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Common <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. On 22 Feb., 1911, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14145b.htm">Sophene</a> and auxiliary to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06726a.htm">Grand Rapids</a>. He at once espoused the cause of workman in their difficulties with the employers in the furniture factories, skilfully averted a panic, and contributed much to bring about and agreement. On 11 Aug., 1911, he was transferred to the See of Toledo. A notable demonstration marked his entry into the city on Sunday, 1 Oct., and on 4 Oct. he was <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> in his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>.
