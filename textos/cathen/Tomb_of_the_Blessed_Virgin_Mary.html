<h1>Tomb of the Blessed Virgin Mary</h1>  

<p><a href="../images/14774aax.jpg"><img alt="Image" align=right src="../images/14774aat.jpg"></a>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03475c.htm">Valley of Cedron</a>, near <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Modern writers hold, however, that <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> died and was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> at Ephesus. The main points of the question to be taken into consideration are as follows.
<h2>Testimony in favor of Jerusalem</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> works of the second to the fourth century are all favourable to the <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> tradition. According to the "Acts of St. John by Prochurus", written (160-70) by Lencius, the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> went to Ephesus accompanied by Prochurus alone and at a very advanced age, i.e. after <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary's</a> death. The two letters "B. Inatii missa S. Joanni", written about 370, show that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> passed the remainder of her days at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. That of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius the Areopagite</a> to the Bishop Titus (363), the "Joannis liber de Dormitione Mariae" (third to fourth century), and the treatise "De transitu B.M. Virginis" (fourth century) place her <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> at <a href="../cathen/06540a.htm">Gethsemane</a>.

<p>From an historical standpoint these works, although <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>, have a real value, reflecting as they do the tradition of the early centuries. At the beginning of the fifth century a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrim</a> from <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> visited "the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08503a.htm">valley of Josaphat</a>", and about 431 the "Breviarius de Hierusalem" mentions in that <a href="../cathen/08503a.htm">valley</a> "the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Holy Mary</a>, which contains her <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a>". Thenceforth <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> of various <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> repaired thither to <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerate</a> the empty <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a>, St. Modestus, St. Sophronius, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a>, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, <a href="../cathen/01473b.htm">St. Andrew</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Crete, John of Thessalonica, Hippolytus of Thebes, and <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> teach this same fact and bear witness that this tradition was accepted by all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a> of East and <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a>. <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a>, preaching on the <a href="../cathen/02006b.htm">feast of the Assumption</a> at <a href="../cathen/06540a.htm">Gethsemane</a>, recalls that, according to the "Euthymian History", III, xl (written probably by Cyril of Scythopolis in the fifth century), Juvenal, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, sent to Constantinople in 452 at the command of the <a href="../cathen/09644a.htm">Emperor Marcian</a> and <a href="../cathen/12561c.htm">Pulcheria</a>, his wife, the Shroud of the Blessed Virgin preserved in the church of <a href="../cathen/06540a.htm">Gethsemane</a> (P.G., XCVI, 747-51). The <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> has since been <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in that city at the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Our Lady of Blachernae.
<h2>Testimony in favor of Ephesus</h2>

<p>There was never any tradition connecting <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary's</a> death and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">burial</a> with the city of Ephesus. Not a single writer or pilgrim speaks of her <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> as being there; and in the thirteenth century Perdicas, prothonotary of Ephesus, visited "the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a> at <a href="../cathen/06540a.htm">Gethsemane</a>", and describes it in his poem (P.G., CXXXIII, 969). In a letter sent in 431 by the members of the <a href="../cathen/05491a.htm">Council of Ephesus</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Constantinople we read that <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> "reached the city of Ephesus where <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John the Theologian</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, the Holy Virgin, were separated from the assembly of the holy Fathers", etc. <a href="../cathen/14724b.htm">Tillemont</a> has completed the elliptical phrase by adding arbitrarily, "have their <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a>".

<p>He is followed by a few writers. According to the meditations of <a href="../cathen/05406b.htm">Sister Catherine Emmerich</a> (d. 1824), compiled and published in 1852, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> died and was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> not at Ephesus but three or four leagues south of the city. She is followed by those who accept her <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> or meditations as <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">Divine revelations</a>. However, <a href="../cathen/02784b.htm">St. Brigid</a> relates that at the time of her visit to the church of <a href="../cathen/06540a.htm">Gethsemane</a> the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> appeared to her and spoke to her of her stay of three days in that place and of her <a href="../cathen/02006b.htm">Assumption into Heaven</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">revelations</a> of <a href="../cathen/01229a.htm">Ven. Maria d'Agreda</a> do not contradict those of <a href="../cathen/05406b.htm">Catherine Emmerich</a>.
<h2>The Church of the Sepulchre of Mary</h2>

<p><a href="../images/14774abx.gif"><img alt="Image" align=right src="../images/14774abt.gif"></a>

<p>As the soil is considerably raised in the <a href="../cathen/03475c.htm">Valley of the Cedron</a>, the ancient Church of the Sepulchre of Mary is completely covered and hidden. A score of steps descend from the road into the court <a href="../images/14774abt.gif">(see Plan: B)</a>, at the back of which is a beautiful twelfth century <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> <a href="../images/14774abt.gif">(C)</a>. It opens on a monumental stairway of forty-eight steps. The twentieth step leads into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> built in the fifth century, to a great extent cut from the rock. It forms a cross of unequal arms <a href="../images/14774abt.gif">(D)</a>. In the centre of the eastern arm, 52 feet long and 20 feet wide is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of Christ</a>. It is a little room with a bench hewn from the rocky mass in imitation of the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. This has given it the shape of a cubical edicule, about ten feet in circumference and eight feet high. Until the fourteenth century the little monument was covered with magnificent marble slabs and the walls of the church were covered with frescoes. Since 1187 the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> has been the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Muslim</a> Government which nevertheless authorizes the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to officiate in it.
