<h1>Tommaso Campanella</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptized</a> GIOVANNI DOMENICO)

<p><a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and writer, b. 5 Sept. 1568 at Stilo in the province of Calabria, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 21 May, 1639. He was a facile writer of prose and verse at the age of thirteen, and when not yet fifteen entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, attracted by the fame of <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albert the Great</a> and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a>. With a predilection for <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> inquiry, he was sent to different <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> to hear the best masters. Campanella wrote his first work, "Philosophia sensibus demonstrata" (Naples, 1590) in defence of the naturalistic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> <a href="../cathen/14477a.htm">Bernardino Telesio</a>. He next went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and afterwards to the <a href="../cathen/11387a.htm">University of Padua</a>, from Oct., 1592, to the end of 1594. An ardent and somewhat captious temperament led him into the expression of views offensive to many of the older and newer <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> alike. He was especially vigorous in his opposition to the authority of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, and was cited before the Holy Office at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was detained till 1597. Some accounts speak of his having been accused of magic and of his fleeing to <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, and Bologna, thence back to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and Stilo. Continuing to lecture and write, however, he retained favour in certain circles. At length, in Sept., 1599, he was seized as head of a conspiracy against the Spanish rule. In the trial at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, involving many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, lay and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>, he was charged with divers <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and with aiming to set up a <a href="../cathen/04179a.htm">communistic</a> commonwealth. Arraigned before an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> tribunal, he was at the same time harassed and put to torture by a political court. On 8 Jan., 1603, he was sentenced to perpetual <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. Among several who sought to obtain his liberation was <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Pope Paul V</a>. In the meantime the viceroy, Giron, who used to visit Campanella in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, seeking his counsel about matters of state, became involved in trouble. In his endeavours to extricate himself he laid the blame largely on Campanella, who was again subjected to many indignities. Through <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Pope Urban VIII</a>, who applied directly to Philip IV of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, the unfortunate <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> was at last released from his <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> captivity, 15 May, 1626, an event which was commemorated by Gabriel Naude in his "Panegyricus" (Paris, 1644). He was taken to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and held for a time by the Holy Office, but was restored to full liberty, 6 April, 1629. In 1634 another Calabrian conspiracy under one of Campanella's followers threatened fresh complications. With the aid of Cardinal Barberini and the French ambassador, <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">De Noailles</a>, Campanella, disguised as a <a href="../cathen/10325a.htm">Minim</a>, withdrew to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Louis XIII and <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> received him with marked favour, the latter granting him a liberal pension. He spent the rest of his days, enjoying <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> favour, in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St-Honore at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>.

<p>Of the life and character of Campanella, conflicting estimates are given. He was well thought of by Popes <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>. Cardinal Pallavicini* declared him a "man who had read all things and who remembered all things; of mighty but indomitable character." In <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> allegiance he was held above suspicion by Juan <a href="../cathen/09418b.htm">De Lugo</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; <a href="../cathen/12672c.htm">Theophile Raynaud</a> considered him <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>. Vincent Baron, O.P., who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him well, gave a careful eulogy of him as skilled in mathematics, <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a>, medicine, and other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>; more famous, perhaps, than he deserved to be, but still a man of extraordinary gifts. John Addington Symonds, who translated a book of his sonnets (Sonnets of Michael Angelo Buonarotti and Tommaso Campanella, London, 1878), refers to him as the "audacious Titan of the modern age, possessing essentially a combative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; a poet and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> militant, who stood alone making <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon the authority of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> in <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, of <a href="../cathen/09501a.htm">Machiavelli</a> in statecraft, and of <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a> in art". His nunquam tacebo is evidenced in almost every act and utterance of his strange career. Campanella's work is critical and composite rather than constructive and original. It exhibits an almost encyclopedic acquaintance with all the known <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> of his day. His <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> does not form a system, but discloses a <a href="../cathen/14383c.htm">syncretic</a> adaptation of certain fundamental principles of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> and <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albert the Great</a>, modified by original opinions and fused with <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, often unsound and bizarre, borrowed from Pythagoras, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, <a href="../cathen/15756b.htm">Zeno</a>, Empedocles, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> mystics, and the Jewish and Arabic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of thought. He aimed to reconstruct scholastic philosophy, but, lacking grasp and depth, his judgment was often obscured by an untempered <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, and his writings, of widest scope, abound in the inequalities of undisciplined genius. With the fondness of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> for disputation and innovation, he was also singularly swayed by the popular pseudo-science of judicial <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a>. Unlike Bruno, however, he remained loyal to his order and to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In his theologico-cosmological theory, being, both created and Divine, is invested with three primordial properties: power, wisdom, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Non-being is characterized by impotence, darkness, and odium or metaphysical aversion. In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is pure being, simple and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, the three properties of being exist and subsist in simplest unity to the absolute exclusion of non-being and its attributes. Creatures participate in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> wisdom, power, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; but, because derived from nothingness, their essence is a mixture of being and non-being. The Divine, impressed upon, immanent in, and shared by, finite natures, is the principle, the sufficient reason, and the measure of their relative perfection and of their development in time and space. The <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is vivified, directed, and governed by a universal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of sense and intelligence. The world is as a living <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The sun and the earth are its principal parts and the common source of animal life and movement, and of the sensation which is also found in all material things, light, air, metals, and wood. Prior to <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a>, to whom he was otherwise superior in erudition, Campanella demonstrated the absurdity of scepticism and undertook to establish by psychologico-ontological argument the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> against <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">Atheism</a>. In the field of natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> Campanella preceded <a href="../cathen/02192a.htm">Bacon</a> in insisting on the direct observation and experimental study of nature. It is noteworthy that whilst <a href="../cathen/02192a.htm">Bacon</a> rejected the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> theory of <a href="../cathen/06342b.htm">Galileo</a>, Campanella favoured it, and wrote a brilliant defence of its author. In his treatise, "De Monarchia Hispanica" ["A Discourse touching the Spanish Monarchy", tr. by Edmund Chilmead (London, 1654) and again by Wm. Prynne (ibid., 1660)], Campanella evinces, among <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> singularly strange and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>, considerable practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of civil government. To extend Spanish rule in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> he advised intermarriage of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> with other nationalities, urged the establishment of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, mathematics, mechanics, etc., and the immediate opening of naval colleges to develop the resources of the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> and further the interests of its inhabitants. In general he advocated natural honesty and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and the universal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of god and man in place of the <a href="../cathen/15241c.htm">utilitarian</a> principles and egoism of <a href="../cathen/09501a.htm">Machiavelli</a>.

<p>Because of its political character, his "Civitas Solis" (City of the Sun), is the most celebrated of his works. It appears in "Ideal Commonwealths" (New York, 1901) and in "Ideal Empires and Republics" (Washington and London, 1901). It was probably intended by Campanella as a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> fiction, like <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> "Republic" and <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">More's</a> "Utopia", for its essentially <a href="../cathen/04179a.htm">communistic</a> delineation, and advocacy, of goods, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, labour, and all necessaries in common could hardly represent the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> mind of an author who, after all, was faithful to at least the spirit of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and who vehemently resisted the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> trend of his contemporaries. Various lists, some furnished by Campanella himself, show him to have been the author of about eighty-eight works. The more important are: "Prodromus Philosophiae instaurandae" (Frankfort, 1617); "Philosophiae rationalis partes quinque" (Paris, 1638); "Realis philosophiae epilogisticae partes quatour" (which contains the "Civitas Solis", Frankfort, 1623); "Medicinalium juxta propria principia libri VII" (Lyons, 1635); "Astrologicorum libri VI" (Lyons, 1629); "Apologia pro Galileo mathematico" (Frankfort, 1622); "Atheismus triumphatus" (Rome, 1631); "De praedestinatione, electione, reprobatione et auxiliis divinae gratiae, cento thomisticus" (Paris, 1636). Numerous unpublished <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are preserved in the archives of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.
