<h1>Tommaso Maria Zigliara</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptismal</a> <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">name</a>, FRANCESCO).

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, b. at Bonifacio, a seaport town of <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>, toward the end of October, 1833; d. in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 11 May, 1893. His early Classical studies were made in his native town under the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> teacher, Father Aloysius Piras. At the age of eighteen he was received into the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and in 1852 he made his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>. From the beginning Zigliara was a student of uncommon brilliancy. He studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, where, 17 May, 1856, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by Cardinal Joachim Pecci, then <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>. Soon afterwards the young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was appointed to teach <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, first in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, then at Corbara in his native <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>, and later in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, at <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, being at the same time master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> in the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Gradi.

<p>When his work at <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> was finished, he was called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, again made master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, and shortly appointed regent, or head professor, of the Minerva college. Before assuming this latter <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, he was raised to the dignity of master in sacred <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. When his community was forced by the Italian Government in 1873 to give up the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Minerva, Zigliara with other professors and students took refuge with the <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Fathers of the Holy Ghost</a>, who had charge of the French College in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Here the lectures were continued until a house near the Minerva was secured. Zigliara's fame was now widespread in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and elsewhere. French, Italian, German, English, and American <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were eager to put some of their most promising students and young professors under his tuition. Between Cardinal Pecci, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, and Zigliara there had existed for many years the closest friendship, and when the former became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, in his first consistory (1879) he created Zigliara a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. Zigliara was first numbered among the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">cardinal-deacons</a>, then he became a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priest</a>, and in 1893 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06243a.htm">Frascati</a>, one of the seven suburban sees; but, owing to the sickness which ended in his death, he never received episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>.

<p>He was a member of seven <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman congregations</a>, besides being prefect of the Congregation of Studies and co-president of the Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas. He was a man of deep <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and devotion, and a tireless student to the end of his life. In addition to his many <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, he was entrusted with the superintendence of the Leonine edition of the works of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, the first volume of which contains his own commentary. He also found time to publish his "Propaedeutica ad Sacram Theologiam" and to write an extensive work on the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, of which only the tracts on <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and penance received final revision before his death. The most important, however, of Zigliara's works is his "Summa Philosophica", which enjoys a world-wide circulation. For many years this has been the textbook in a great number of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> and colleges of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and America; and not very long ago it was adopted as the textbook for the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> examination in the National University of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. His other works are: Osservazioni su alcune interpretazioni di G.C. Ubaghs sull' ideologia di San Tommaso d'Aquino" (Viterbo, 1870); "Della luce intellettuale e dell' ontologismo secondo la dottrina di S. Bonaventura e Tommaso d'Aquino" (2 vols., Rome, 1874); "De mente Concilii Vienensis in definiendo dogmate unionis animae humanae cum corpore" (1878); "Commentaria S. Thomae in Aristotelis libros Peri Hermeneias et Posteriorum analyticorum", in fol. vol. I new edit. "Opp. S. Thomae": (Rome, 1882); "Saggio sui principi del tradizionalismo"; "Dimittatur e la spiegazione datane dalla S. Congregazione dell' Indice".

<p>By his teaching and through his writings, he was one of the chief instruments, under <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, of reviving and propagating <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> philosophy throughout the entire Church. In his own order and in some <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> and <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, the teaching of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> had never been interrupted, but it was reserved for Zigliara to give a special impetus to the movement which has made <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> dominant in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world.
