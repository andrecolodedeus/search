<h1>Tom&aacute;s de Torquemada</h1>  

<p>First Grand Inquisitor of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a> in 1420; died at <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a>, 16 September, 1498. He was a nephew of the celebrated <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, Juan de Torquemada. In his early youth he entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, and later was appointed <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the Monastery of Santa Cruz at <a href="../cathen/13684b.htm">Segovia</a>, an office which he held for twenty-two years. The Infanta Isabella chose him as her confessor while at <a href="../cathen/13684b.htm">Segovia</a>, and when she succeeded to the throne of Castile in 1474 he became one of her most trusted and influential councillors, but refused all high <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> preferments, choosing to remain a simple friar.

<p>At that time the purity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> was in great danger from the numerous Marranos and Moriscos, who, for material considerations, became sham converts from <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The Marranos committed serious outrages against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and endeavoured to judaize the whole of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sovereigns had been empowered to establish by <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> in 1478, had, despite unjustifiable cruelties, failed of its purpose, chiefly for want of centralisation. In 1483 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> appointed Torquemada, who had been an assistant inquisitor since 11 February 1482, Grand Inquisitor of Castile, and on 17 October extended his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>.

<p>As <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> representative and the highest official of the inquisitorial court, Torquemada directed the entire business of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, was empowered to delegate his inquisitorial faculties to other Inquisitors of his own choosing, who remained accountable to him, and settled the appeals made to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. He immediately established tribunals at <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, <a href="../cathen/08267a.htm">Ja&eacute;n</a>, <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a>, <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>, and Villa-real, and, in 1484, at Saragossa for the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Kingdom of Aragon</a>. He also instituted a High Council, consisting of five members, whose chief <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> was to assist him in the hearing of appeals (see <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">INQUISITION</a> &#151; <em>The <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a></em>). He convened a general assembly of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> inquisitors at <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, 29 November, 1484, and presented an outline of twenty-eight articles for their guidance. To these he added several new <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> in 1485, 1488, and 1498 (Reuss, "Sammlungen der Instructionen des spanischen Inquisitionsgerichts", Hanover, 1788). The Marranos found a powerful means of evading the tribunals in the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, whose riches had made them very influential and over whom the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> had no <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. On this account Torquemada urged the sovereigns to compel all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> either to become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> or to leave <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. To frustrate his designs the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> agreed to pay the Spanish government 30,000 ducats if left unmolested. There is a tradition that when Ferdinand was about to yield to the enticing offer, Torquemada appeared before him, bearing a crucifix aloft, and exclaiming: "Judas Iscariot sold Christ for 30 pieces of silver; Your Highness is about to sell him for 30,000 ducats. Here He is; take Him and sell Him." Leaving the crucifix on the table he left the room. Chiefly through his instrumentality the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were expelled from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in 1492.

<p>Much has been written of the inhuman cruelty of Torquemada. Llorente computes that during Torquemada's office (1483-98) 8800 suffered death by fire and 9,654 were punished in other ways (Histoire de l'Inquisition, IV, 252). These figures are highly exaggerated, as has been conclusively <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by Hefele (Cardinal Ximenes, ch. xviii), <a href="../cathen/06376a.htm">Gams</a> (Kirchengeschichte von Spanien, III, II, 68-76), and many others. Even the Jewish historian Graetz contents himself with stating that "under the first Inquisitor Torquemada, in the course of fourteen years (1485-1498) at least 2000 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were burnt as impenitent sinners" ("History of the Jews", Philadelphia, 1897, IV, 356). Most historians hold with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Peschel (Das Zeitalter der Entdeckungen, Stuttgart, 1877, pp. 119 sq.) that the number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> burnt from 1481 to 1504, when Isabella died, was about 2000. Whether Torquemada's ways of ferreting out and punishing <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> were justifiable is a matter that has to be decided not only by comparison with the penal standard of the fifteenth century, but also, and chiefly, by an inquiry into their necessity for the preservation of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The contemporary Spanish chronicler, Sebastian de Olmedo (Chronicon magistrorum generalium Ordinis Pr&aelig;dicatorum, fol. 80-81) calls Torquemada "the hammer of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, the light of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, the saviour of his country, the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of his order".
