<h1>Tonsure</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>tondere</em>, "to shear")

<p>A sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> instituted by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by which a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and confirmed <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is received into the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> order by the shearing of his hair and the investment with the <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> thus tonsured becomes a partaker of the common <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privileges</a> and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> state and is prepared for the reception of orders. The tonsure itself is not an <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> properly so called, nor a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> order. It is rather a simple ascription of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to the Divine service in such things as are common to all <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. Historically the tonsure was not in use in the primitive <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> during the age of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Even later, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (in Ezech., xliv) disapproves of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> shaving their heads. Indeed, among the Greeks and Romans such a custom was a badge of <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slavery</a>. On this very account, the shaving of the head was adopted by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. Towards the end of the fifth, or beginning of the sixth, century, the <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> passed over to the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>.

<p>As a sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a>, the tonsure was originally joined to the first <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> received, as in the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> it still is to the order of <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> it began as a separate <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> about the end of the seventh century, when <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> offered their young sons to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Tonsure is to be given by a candidate's ordinary, though mitred <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> can bestow it on their own subjects. No special age for its reception is prescribed, but the recipient must have learnt the rudiments of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and be able to read and write. The <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> may be performed at any <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> or place. As to the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> tonsure, some writers have distinguished three kinds: (1) the Roman, or that of St. Peter, when all the head is shaved except a circle, of hair; (2) the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern</a>, or St. Paul's, when the entire head is denuded of hair; (3) the Celtic, or <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John's</a>, when only a crescent of hair is shaved from the front of the head. In <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">Britain</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxon</a> opponents of the Celtic tonsure called it the tonsure of <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>. According to canon law, all <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> are bound to wear the tonsure under certain penalties. But on this subject, <a href="../cathen/14466a.htm">Taunton</a> (loc. cit. inf.) says: "In English-speaking countries, from a custom arising in the days of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and having a prescription of over three centuries, the shaving of the head, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> crown, seems, with the tacit <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, to have passed out of use. No provincial or national council has ordered it, even when treating of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> dress; and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> has not inserted the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> when correcting the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> of those councils."
