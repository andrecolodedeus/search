<h1>Torah</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Use of word</h2>

<p>Torah, <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c01.gif" height=16> (cf. Hiph. of <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c02.gif" height=16>), signifies first "direction, instruction", as, for instance, the instruction of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> (<a href="../bible/pro001.htm#vrs8">Proverbs 1:8</a>), or of the wise (<a href="../bible/pro003.htm#vrs1">Proverbs 3:1</a>). It is used chiefly in reference to the Divine instruction, especially through the revelation to Moses, the "Law", and to the teaching of the Prophets concerning the will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In the sense of law "Torah" refers only to the Divine <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. "Torah" is applied to the books containing the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> revelation and the Law, that is, the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>. In Jewish <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> Torah signifies, first, the totality of Jewish <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, whether taken as a basis for religious <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and conduct, or as a basis for study. The body of Biblical writings, especially the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>, being the source of religious teaching and law, the term "Torah" is applied also to the entire Scriptures (cf. Blau, "Zur Einleitung in die hl. Schrift", Budapest, 1894, 16 sq.), or to passages from the Prophets and the Hagiographa, for instance, "Ab. zara", 17a, in reference to <a href="../bible/pro005.htm#vrs8">Proverbs 5:8</a>, and "Sanh." 91b, in connexion with <a href="../bible/psa084.htm#vrs5">Psalm 84:5</a>. The expression, however, generally signifies the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>. In passages like <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c03.gif" height=18> ("the Scriptures [Torah] consist of three parts, Torah, Prophets, and Hagiographa" [Midrash Tanchuma to <a href="../bible/exo019.htm#vrs1">Exodus 19:1</a>]) "Torah" is used in two senses&mdash;one general, meaning the whole Scriptures, the other special, signifying the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>. Elsewhere (Siphre to 32, 13-135b 24) the Torah is plainly distinguished from the non-Pentateuchal books by the comparison of <em>miqra</em> (<img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c04.gif" height=16>) and Torah. Besides the "written" Torah, <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c05.gif" height=16>, the <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> which holds to tradition speaks of an "oral" Torah, <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c06.gif" height=18>, the commentaries and the ordinances which put into effect the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> contained in the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>. This oral Torah, it is claimed, was revealed to Moses and has been preserved in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> by tradition (see <a href="../cathen/14435b.htm">T<font size=-2>ALMUD</font></a>.)
<h2 id="section2">Torah in the restricted sense of Pentateuch</h2>

<p>The Torah relates the preparatory measures for and the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old-Testament</a> theocracy, and contains the institutions and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> in which this theocracy found its visible expression. The old Testament itself calls the entire work after its main contents (<em>ha</em>)<em>tora</em> or <em>sefer</em> (<img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c07.gif" height=16>), <em>ha-tora,</em> that is, "the book of the Torah", as in <a href="../bible/neh008.htm#vrs2">Nehemiah 8:2</a>; to emphasize its Divine origin it is called <em>torath Yahwe, sefer torath Yahwe</em> (<a href="../bible/ezr007.htm#vrs10">Ezra 7:10</a>; <a href="../bible/1ch016.htm#vrs40">1 Chronicles 16:40</a>; <a href="../bible/neh008.htm#vrs8">Nehemiah 8:8</a>), and <em>sefer torath Yahwe <a href="../cathen/05393a.htm">Elohim</a></em> (II Esd. ix, 3); while <em>sefer torath Moshe</em> (<a href="../bible/neh008.htm#vrs1">Nehemiah 8:1</a>), <em>sefer Moshe</em> (<a href="../bible/ezr006.htm#vrs18">Ezra 6:18</a>; <a href="../bible/neh013.htm#vrs1">Nehemiah 13:1</a>; <a href="../bible/2ch025.htm#vrs4">2 Chronicles 25:4</a>; <a href="../bible/2ch035.htm#vrs12">35:12</a>) indicate its author. The Talmud and later Jewish writings call the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> <em>sefer (ha) tora</em>; the name is always used if the whole work were written as a scroll (<em>megilla</em>) for use in the Divine service. If the work is written in five scrolls or in book form it is called <em>h<sup>a</sup>misha hum<sup>e</sup>she (ha)tora</em> (<img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c08.gif" height=16>), "the five- fifths of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>". This division into five parts is old, and in the time of Nehemias served as a model for the division of the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> into five books. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> generally named the individual books after the first word: (1) <em>b<sup>e</sup>reshith,</em> <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c09.gif" height=16>; (2) <em>sh<sup>e</sup>math</em> or <em>w<sup>e</sup>&rsquo;elle sh<sup>e</sup>moth,</em> <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c10.gif" height=16> or <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c11.gif" height=18>; (3) <em>wayyiqra,</em> <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c12.gif" height=18>; (4) <em>b<sup>e</sup>midbar</em> or <em>wayy<sup>e</sup>dabber,</em> <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c13.gif" height=16>, <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c14.gif" height=16>; (5) <em>d<sup>e</sup>barim</em> or <em>&rsquo;elle ha-d<sup>e</sup>barim,</em> <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c15.gif" height=18> (cf. as early a writer as <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> on <a href="../bible/psa001.htm">Psalm 1</a>: <em>Bresith, O&rsquo;ualesmoth, O&rsquo;uikra, &rsquo;Elle &lsquo;addebarim</em>). There are also names indicating the main contents of the books given to Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy: <em>torah koh<sup>a</sup>nim,</em> <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c17.gif" height=16>, "law of the priests", for instance in "Meg.", iii, 6; <em>homesh ha-piqqudim,</em> <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c18.gif" height=18>, "the fifth of the numberings", as in "Yoma", vii, 1, <em>mishne tora</em> (<img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c19.gif" height=16>), i.e., Deuteronomy, as in <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Masorah</a> to <a href="../bible/deu017.htm#vrs18">Deuteronomy 17:18</a>. On the other hand <em>sefer ye&#231;ira,</em> <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c20.gif" height=16>, "book of the Creation", in Sanh., 62<sup>b</sup>, and <em>n<sup>e</sup>ziqin,</em> <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c21.gif" height=20>, "injuries", <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Masorah</a> to <a href="../bible/gen024.htm#vrs8">Genesis 24:8</a>, are not to be applied, as is often done, to Genesis and Exodus; they refer only to the account of the Creation and to <a href="../bible/exo021.htm#vrs22">Exodus 21:22</a>.

<p>Another method of division is that by which the paragraphs, or <em>parashiyyoth</em> (<img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c22.gif" height=16>, sing. <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c33.gif" height=16>), are indicated in the scrolls of the Torah used in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>. In the older Midrashim these divisions are called <em>parashiyyoth p<sup>e</sup>thuhoth,</em> <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c24.gif" height=16>, "open <em>parashiyyoth</em>"; or <em>parashiyyoth s<sup>e</sup>thumoth,</em> <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c25.gif" height=16>, "closed <em>parashiyyoth</em>". In the former, the portion of the line following the last word is left blank; in the latter the termination of the paragraph is indicated by leaving only part of the line blank. Such paragraphs are called "small <em>parashiyyoth</em>" and they are generally indicated in the printed editions of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> by <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c26.gif" height=16> or <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c27.gif" height=16>. The <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> has altogether 290 open and 379 closed parashiyyoth. In quoting they are generally called after main contents (as <em>Baba bathra 14a</em>: <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c28.gif" height=20> that is, <a href="../bible/num022.htm#vrs2">Numbers 22:2</a>-<a href="../bible/num024.htm#vrs25">24:25</a>), but sometimes after the first words (as <em>Ta'anith</em> iv, 3, the first six <em>parashiyyoth</em> of Genesis). The <em>parashiyyoth</em> are regarded as the arrangement of the divisions of the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> according to contents; but the basis of the distinction between open and closed <em>parashiyyoth</em> is not known with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>.

<p>Another division of the Torah is connected with the reading of lessons read in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, a practice referred to in <a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs21">Acts 15:21</a>, <em>&rsquo;ek gene&ocirc;n &rsquo;archa&#237;on</em> as being ancient (cf. also <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, "Contra Apion.", II, xvii). It was customary in Palestine to have a three years' cycle of these lessons (Meg., 29<sup>b</sup>); some writers say there was also a cycle of three years and a half. The <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>, therefore, was divided into 154-175 sections or <em>s<sup>e</sup>darim</em> (<img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c30.gif" height=16>, sing. <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c31.gif" height=16>). These <em>s<sup>e</sup>darim</em> though not indicated in our Bibles, are important for understanding the structure of the old Midrashim (cf. B&uuml;chler, "The Reading of the Law and Prophets in a Triennial Cycle" in "Jew. Quart. Rev.", V, 420 sqq., VI, 1 sqq., VIII, 528 sq.). In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> an annual cycle, which first acquired authority among the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and is now accepted by nearly all Jewish communities, was adopted. <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Maimonides</a> (Hilhoth Tephilla, XIII, 1) calls it the prevailing custom of his era (twelfth century), but says that some read the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> in three years, which, according to Benjamin of <a href="../cathen/15085b.htm">Tudela</a>, was the practice about 1170 among scattered communities in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (cf. Jew. Quart. Rev., V, 420). In this one-year cycle the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> is divided into fifty-four <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> lessons generally called large <em>parashiyyoth</em>. A Jewish intercalary year consisting of thirteen lunar months contains fifty-three <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>, and the final section is always read on the day of the "joy of the Law" (<img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c32.gif" height=16>), that is, the ninth day after the feast of booths (twenty-third day of <em>Tishri</em>). In ordinary years, when there are forty-seven <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>, two <em>parashiyyoth</em> are joined on each of seven <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a> in order to complete the number. In Genesis there are twelve <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> <em>parashiyyoth,</em> in Exodus eleven, in Leviticus and Numbers ten each, and in Deuteronomy eleven. They are named from and quoted by the first words. In the printed editions of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> they are indicated, as they are also the opening words the open or closed <em>parashiyyoth,</em> by <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c33.gif" height=16> or <img alt="Image" src="../images/14779c34.gif" height=16>, with exception of the twelfth lesson, at the beginning of which (<a href="../bible/gen047.htm#vrs28">Genesis 47:28</a>) only the breadth of a letter should remain blank. Concerning the distribution of the fifty-four <em>parashiyyoth</em> for the year, cf. Loeb, "Rev. des &eacute;tudes juives", VI, 250 sqq.; Derenbourg, ibid., VII, 146 sqq.; Schmid, "&#220;berverschiedene Einteilungen der hl. Schrift" (Graz, 1892), 4 sqq.

<p>The Old Synagogue and the Talmud firmly maintain the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> authorship of the Torah, but <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> are entertained regarding a number of passages. In "Baba bathra" 15<sup>e</sup> only the last eight verses of Deuteronomy, which speak of the death and burial of Moses, are assigned to another author. On the other hand Simeon (loc. cit.) teaches, referring to <a href="../bible/deu031.htm#vrs26">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>, that these verses were also written by Moses under Divine direction (cf. also <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, "Antiq Jud.", IV, viii, 48). During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> were expressed as to the possibility of Moses writing certain sentences; for instance, by Rabbi Yishaq (to <a href="../bible/gen036.htm#vrs11">Genesis 36:11</a>) who was opposed by <a href="../cathen/01039c.htm">Aben Ezra</a>, and as well by <a href="../cathen/01039c.htm">Aben Ezra</a> himself (to <a href="../bible/gen012.htm#vrs6">Genesis 12:6</a>; <a href="../bible/exo025.htm#vrs4">Exodus 25:4</a>; <a href="../bible/deu001.htm#vrs1">Deuteronomy 1:1</a>; <a href="../bible/deu031.htm#vrs22">31:22</a>). Taken altogether, even in the succeeding period the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> authorship remained undisputed, at least by the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. They hold, moreover, the Divine origin of the entire Torah, and the eighth of the thirteen <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> formulated by <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Maimonides</a> and incorporated into the <a href="../cathen/12350a.htm">prayer-book</a> reads: "I believe with full <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that the entire Torah as it is in our hands is the one which was given to our teacher Moses, to whom be peace." (See <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">P<font size=-2>ENTATEUCH</font> </a>.)
