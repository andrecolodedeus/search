<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Toribio de Benavente Motolinia</h1>  

<p>Franciscan missionary, b. at Benavente, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, at the end of the fifteenth century; d. in the <a href="../cathen/10269a.htm">City of Mexico</a>, 10 August, 1568. He was one of the first band of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> who sailed for Mexico with Fray Martin do Valencia, and survived all his companions. Upon entering religion, he changed his name of Paredes for that of Benavente, following the then regular custom of the order. As he and his companions on their way to the <a href="../cathen/10269a.htm">City of Mexico</a> passed through Tlaxcala, the Indians, seeing the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> aspect and ragged habits of the religious, kept repeating to each other the word <em>motolinia. </em>Fray Toribio, having asked the meaning of this word and learned that it was the Mexican for <em>poor</em>, said: "It is the first word I have learned in this language, and, that I may not forget it, it shall henceforth be my name." Bernal D&iacute;az del Castillo, an eyewitness of the arrival of the first <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, singles Motolinia out from the others, saying of him: "Whatever was given him he gave to the Indians, and sometimes was left without food. He wore very torn clothing and went barefoot, and the Indians <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> him much, because he was a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>." When Motolinia and his companions arrived at the <a href="../cathen/10269a.htm">City of Mexico</a>, <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Cortes</a> went out to receive them, accompanied by all his captains and the chief men of the place. The religious carried wooden crosses in their hands; <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Cortes</a> and those with him <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">knelt</a> and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> their hands with the deepest respect, and then conducted them to the lodgings prepared for them. The Indians wondered much when they saw those whom they considered <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> beings prostrate at the feet of these <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and apparently despicable men. <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Cortes</a> seized the opportunity to address a discourse to the <em>caciques </em>(chiefs) and lords who accompanied him, recommending due veneration and respect, as he himself had shown, for those who had come to teach them the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. When <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Cortes</a> set out on the expedition to Las Hibueras, the influence of Motolinia over the Indians was so great that the conqueror commissioned him to see that "no rising took place in Mexico or the other provinces" during his absence. Motolinia subsequently made a journey to <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>, where he made use of the faculties which he had to administer confirmation, and thence passed to Nicaragua. Returning to Mexico, he was guardian successively at Texcoco and Tlaxcala, and was chosen sixth <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the Province of Santo Evangelio. When Don Sebastian Ramirez de Fuenleal, president of the second <em>Audiencia, </em>decided to found the settlement of Puebla, Fray Toribio, who had joined in requesting this foundation, was one of the commissioners chosen to carry out the work, with the auditor Don Juan de Salmeron. In association with the guardians of <a href="../cathen/14747c.htm">Tlaxcala</a>, Cholula, Huexotzingo, and Tepeaca, and employing a large number of Indian labourers, they built the city. Motolinia said the first Mass here on 16 April, 1530, and with his companions made the allotments of land choosing for the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> the site upon which is still to be seen the beautiful church of <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>. He himself left in writing the total of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> performed by him, amounting to 400,000, "which," says Padre Torquemada, "I who write this have seen confirmed by his name." The Indians <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> him tenderly for his virtues and, above all, for his ardent charity. He died in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of S. Francisco, in the <a href="../cathen/10269a.htm">City of Mexico</a>, and the crowd at his burial had to be restrained from cutting in pieces the habit which his corpse wore, pieces of which they would have taken as <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of a saint.

<p>Among the writings of Motolinia is his famous letter to <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a>, written on 2 January, 1555. It is a virulent attack upon <a href="../cathen/03397a.htm">Bishop Bartolom&eacute; de las Casas</a>, intended to discredit him completely, calling him "a grievous man, restless, importunate, turbulent, injurious, and prejudicial" and moreover an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> in that he had renounced the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/03652b.htm">Chiapas</a>. The monarch is even advised to have him shut up for safe keeping in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. While it is impossible to save the memory of Motolinia from the blot which this letter has p laced upon it, some explanation of his conduct can be given. He may have foreseen the extremely grave evils that would have resulted to the social system, as it was then established in New Spain, if the theories of <a href="../cathen/03397a.htm">Las Casas</a> had become completely dominant. Indeed, when it is remembered that these theories jeopardized the fortunes of nearly all the colonists, not only in Mexico, but also throughout the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>--fortunes which they had perhaps amassed illegally, but, in many instances, in <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a> and at the cost of incredible labours and perils--it may well be understood why so tremendous an animosity should have been felt against the man who not only had originated the theories, but had effected their triumph at Court; who was endeavouring with incredible tenacity of purpose to put them into practice, and who, in his directions to confessors, asserts that all the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> of the Indies must despoil themselves of all their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, except what they have acquired by commerce, and no longer hold <em>encomien</em>des or slaves. The theory of <em>encomiendas </em>was not in itself blameworthy; for the Indians, being like all other subjects bound to contribute towards the expenses of government, it made no difference to them whether the paid tribute direct to the government or to the holders of royal, commissions <em>(encomiendas). </em>What made the system intolerable was the mass of horrible abuses committed under its shadow; had <a href="../cathen/03397a.htm">las Casas</a> aimed his attack more surely against these abuses, he might perhaps have been more successful in benefitting the Indians. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the "New Laws", the greatest triumph of <a href="../cathen/03397a.htm">las Casas</a>, remained virtually inoperative in Mexico; in <a href="../cathen/03652b.htm">Chiapas</a> and <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a> they led to serious disturbances, and in <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> they resulted in a civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> fraught with crimes and horrors, amidst which the aborigines suffered greatly. Such was the man whom Motolinia sought to oppose, and his attitude was shared by men of the most upright character, e.g. Bishop Marroquin, the viceroy, Don Antonio de Mendoza, and the <em>visitador </em>Tello. However pardonable the intention, it is impossible to forgive the aggressive and virulent tone of the aforesaid denunciation. He wrote some works which were of assistance to <a href="../cathen/10185a.htm">Mendieta</a> and to Torquemada, one of the chief being his "Historia de los Indios de Nueva Espa&ntilde;a".
