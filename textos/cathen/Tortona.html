<p>DIOCESE OF TORTONA (DERTONENSIS)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont, Italy</a>. The city is situated on the spurs of the northern Apennines, on the right bank of the Scrivia, in a plain rich in cereals, wine, hemp, rice, and silk. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is of the sixteenth century, built after <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> had destroyed the ancient <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> situated on a hill which dominated the city, to make room for a fort. In the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, besides pictures of the Lombard School, there is an antique sarcophagus carved with the myths of Phaeton and of Castor and Pollux. Other churches are the very ancient S. Maria Canale, S. Giacomo, and the <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> of Loreto and S. Rocco.

<p>The city of Dertona was founded, or established as a Roman colony, in 147 B.C., at the time of the construction of the Via Posthumiana, which connected <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a> with <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>. As two other very important roads for <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> and Provence began here, Dertona was, under the Empire, an important military station. From the ninth century it was under the rule of its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and in 1090 it became a commune. In the struggles of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> Tortona was the faithful ally of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a>, for which reason it was several times destroyed, e.g. in 1155 by <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a> and in 1163 by the Pavians. From 1260 to 1347 the city was alternately under the dominion or protectorate of the imperial vicars, the marqueses of Montferrat, the Visconti of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and the kings of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. From 1347 it formed a part of the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> state, the fate of which it shared until 1735, when by virtue of the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> it was occupied by the King of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>.

<p>According to legend, which is, however, a late one, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tortona was St. Martianus <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> under Hadrian. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that, in the first half of the fourth century, Tortona was subject to the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, according to Savio, was St. Innocent, who he believes was the predecessor of St. Exuperantius (381), the first of whom we have certain historical record, and who was highly praised in a sermon of <a href="../cathen/10081a.htm">St. Maximus of Turin</a>. Few other names of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the early period are known; but from the tenth century the list is more complete, comprising: Giseprandus (about 943), who was at the same time <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a>; Ottone (1080), a follower of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Henry IV; Guido (1098), who went to Palestine; Bishop Pietro, one of those who in 1241 were made <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> by <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, while on their way to attend the Council of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Melchiorre Busetto was killed by the followers of the Marquess Guglielmo of Montferrat, for which the marquess lost all his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of patronage in the Diocese of Tortona, and was compelled, barefoot and clad in a shirt only, to walk from the scene of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In the time of Michele Marliano (1461) the body of St. Rochus was found at Vaghera, which was the cause of a lengthy controversy with Arles, which possessed the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Rochus of <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a>. Uberto Gambara (1528), afterwards a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, was always absent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> or <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and renounced the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in favour of his relative Cesare (1548), present at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. Maffeo Gambara (1592) distinguished himself in reforming the church, as did also the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatine</a> Paolo Aresio (1620). In 1805 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was suppressed by the French Government and united with Casale, and on its re-establishment in 1814 it was taken from the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> and made suffragan to <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has 296 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 317,865 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, 570 secular and 30 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, five <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, five <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, three <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> for males, and five for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a>.
