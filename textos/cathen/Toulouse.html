<p>A<font size=-2>RCHDIOCESE OF</font> T<font size=-2>OULOUSE</font> (T<font size=-2>OLOSENSIS</font>)

<p>Includes the Department of Haute-Garonne. As re-established by the Concordat of 1802 it included the departments of Haute-Garonne and Ariege, at which time, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> joined to his own the title of <a href="../cathen/02067c.htm">Auch</a>, <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over Auch being given to the <a href="../cathen/01209b.htm">Diocese of Agen</a>, also the title of Narbonne, an archdiocese over which <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> went by the Concordat to the <a href="../cathen/03331b.htm">Diocese of Carcassonne</a>, and the title of <a href="../cathen/01267a.htm">Albi</a>, over which, though formerly an archdiocese, <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> went by the Concordat to the <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">See of Montpellier</a>. In consequence of the creation of the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/02067c.htm">Auch</a> and Albi under the Restoration, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toulouse only styled himself <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toulouse and Narbonne, and when the <a href="../cathen/11435b.htm">Diocese of Pamiers</a> was created the limits of the Archdiocese were restricted to the Department of Haute-Garonne. As thus marked off by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Paternae Caritatis", July, 1822, the Archdiocese of Toulouse includes almost the whole of the ancient Dioceses of Toulouse, Rieux, and Comminges, and a few small portions of the ancient Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">Montauban</a>, Lavaur, St-Papoul, Mirepoix, and Lombez.
<h2 id="section1">Diocese of Toulouse</h2>

<p>Toulouse, chief town of the Tectosagi, at the end of the second century B.C. tried to shake off the yoke of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> during the invasion of the Cimbri, but at the beginning of the empire it was a prosperous Roman civitas with famous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in which the three brothers of the <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> were pupils. In the fourth century it was reckoned the fifteenth town in importance in the empire. In 413 it was taken by Astulph, the Goth, and in 419 under Wallia it became the capital of the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> Kingdom. In 508 after conquest by <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a> it became <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a>. Legends of more or less recent date claim that it was evangelized by <a href="../cathen/09721c.htm">St. Martial</a> (see <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">DIOCESE OF LIMOGES</a>), but as far as historical evidence goes the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> seems to have been founded by <a href="../cathen/13486b.htm">St. Saturninus</a> (Serin) in the middle of the third century. The "Passio Sancti Santurnini" corroborates this date as that of his incumbency and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Subsequent tradition claims that he was a disciple of St. Peter. St. Papoul (see <a href="../cathen/03331b.htm">DIOCESE OF CARCASSONNE</a>) was his companion and like him a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. The name of <a href="../cathen/07451a.htm">St. Honoratus</a>, given in some lists as <a href="../cathen/13486b.htm">St. Saturninus's</a> successor, seems to have crept in through <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> from the fabulous legend of St. Firminus of <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a> and, according to Mgr Duchesne, ought to be omitted. Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Toulouse may be mentioned: Rhodanius (350-58), exiled by Constantius to Phrygia because of his efforts against <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> at the Council of Beziers in 356; St. Hilary, whom some historians place before Rhodanius, but who is placed after him by Mgr Duchesne; St. Sylvius (360-400); <a href="../cathen/05731a.htm">St. Exuperius</a> (c. 400), who drove from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in 405 the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> Vigilantius, saved Toulouse from the ravages of the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a>, and was the friend of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>; St. Germerius (Germier), whose episcopate (c. 541) is questioned by Mgr Duchesne; Magnulphus (c. 585), exiled by King Gondebaud; St. Erembert (657), a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Fontenelle who returned to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to die.

<p>From being the capital of the Duchy of Aquitaine, from 631, Toulouse became in 778 the capital of the County of Toulouse created by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, and which in the tenth century was one of the main fiefs of the crown. Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, known as Raymond de Saint Gilles (1042-1105), was one of the leaders of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section1">First Crusade</a>. Concerning the leanings of <a href="../cathen/12670a.htm">Raymond VI</a> and <a href="../cathen/12670b.htm">Raymond VII</a>, Counts of Toulouse, towards the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensian heresy</a>, and concerning the death of Simon of Montfort in 1218 under the walls of Toulouse, see <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">ALBIGENSES</a>. At this time Toulouse had as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Fulk of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> (1206-31), who fought against <a href="../cathen/12670a.htm">Raymond VI</a> and protected the Friars-Preachers in their early days. The marriage (1249) of Jeanne, daughter of <a href="../cathen/12670b.htm">Raymond VII</a>, with Alphonse de Poitiers, brother of <a href="../cathen/09368a.htm">King Louis IX</a>, led to the uniting in 1271 of the County of Toulouse to the Crown of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and Toulouse became the capital of the Province of Languedoc. The See of Toulouse was for a time made illustrious by St. Louis (1296-97), son of Charles II, King of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and the Two Sicilies, and of Mary, daughter of the King of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>: he was nephew of <a href="../cathen/05389a.htm">St. Elizabeth of Hungary</a> and grand-nephew of St. Louis King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Louis had resigned to his brother Robert all <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> over the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>, and had accepted from <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> the See of Toulouse after donning the habit of St. Francis. His successor was Peter de la Chapelle Taillefer (1298-1312) who was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1305. To this epoch belongs a very important change that took place in the history of the Diocese of Toulouse. It decreased in size but increased in dignity. Before 1295 the Diocese of Toulouse was very extensive. At the beginning of the thirteenth century Bishop Fulk had wished for the sake of religion to divide it into several <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. In 1295 a portion of territory was cut off by <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> to form the <a href="../cathen/11435b.htm">Diocese of Pamiers</a>. Then in 1319 <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> cut off the Diocese of Toulouse from the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> church of Narbonne and made it a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> with the Sees of <a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">Montauban</a>, Saint-Papoul, Rieux, and Lombez as suffragans; a little later Lavaur and Mirepoix also became suffragans of Toulouse. The majority of these sees were composed of territory cut off from the ancient See of Toulouse itself.



<p><a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> offered the See of Riez in Provence to Gaillard de Preyssac, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Toulouse since 1305, whom he suspected of having conspired against him with Hugues Giraud, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a>. Gaillard refused the offer, and retired to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> where he died in 1327. The first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was Raymond de Comminges, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maguelonne from 1309, who, when created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1327, abandoned the See of Toulouse and went to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> where he died in 1348. He left a book on the "Passion of the Saviour", and some "Sermons for Festival Days". Among his successors were: the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> William de Laudun (1327-45), previously <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Vienne; Raymond de Canilhac (1345-50), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1350; Cardinal Francis de Gozie (1391-92); Bernard du Rosier (1451-74), author of two treatises on the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and on the liberty of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and who founded at Toulouse the "College de Foix" for the support of twenty-five poor scholars, where he collected one of the first <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of the period; John of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> (1503-33), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1533. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> entered Toulouse in 1532 through foreign students. As early as 1563 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Toulouse founded a league to uphold the prerogatives of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, protected by the Parlement but jeopardized by certain <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> town-councillors. From 1586 to 1595 the League party under Montmorency, Governor of Languedoc, and the <a href="../cathen/08530c.htm">Duke de Joyeuse</a> held control in Toulouse. The rule of Henry IV was definitively recognized there in 1596. During this period of religious unrest Toulouse had many notable <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>: Gabriel de Gramont (1533-34), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1530; Odet de Chatillon, Cardinal de Coligny (1534-50), who became a <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a>, married in 1564, and died in 1571; Anthony Sanguin (1550-59), Cardinal de Meudon in 1539; Georges d'Armagnac (1562-77), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1544; <a href="../cathen/08530c.htm">Fran&ccedil;ois de Joyeuse</a> (1584-1605), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1583 and who conducted the negotiations between Henry IV and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>Among subsequent <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> we may mention: Louis de Nogaret (1614-27), Cardinal de Lavalette in 1621, but who never received orders and from 1635 to 1637 led part of the French troops in the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a>; Charles de Montchal (1628-51), who in 1635 upheld the decision of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, against the opinion of the majority of the Assembly of Clergy, that the marriages of princes of blood contracted without royal consent were not null; Pierre de Marca (1652-62), who under Louis XIII aided largely in the re-establishment of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in Bearn, in 1621 became president of the Parlement of Bearn, was afterwards made Councillor of State by Louis XIII, and wrote a work of Gallican tendency "De concordia Sacerdotii et Imperii", a voluminous work on <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and especially on the Province of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, and a commentary on the Psalms; he was secretary to the <a href="../cathen/01795a.htm">Assembly of the Clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> of April, 1656, which drew up a formula condemning the Five propositions drawn from the "Augustinus", and he died in 1662 just as he was about to take possession of the See of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; Pierre de Bonzy (1672-73), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1672; Charles Antoine* de Laroche Aymon (1740-52), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1771; Etienne Charles de Lomenie (1763-89), Cardinal de Brienne in 1788; Anne de Clermont Tonnerre (1820-30), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1822; <a href="../cathen/02031a.htm">Paul d'Astros</a> (1830-51), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1850; Julien Desprez (1859-95), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1879; Fran&ccedil;ois Desire Mathieu (1896-99), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1899, was a member of the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a>, wrote the history of Lorraine under the ancien regime, of the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801-2</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> of 1903; he died in 1908.
<h2 id="section2">Diocese of Comminges</h2>

<p>The earliest <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Comminges we know of is Suavis, who assisted at the <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Council of Agde</a> in 506; but Sidonius Apollinaris speaks of the persecutions suffered at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> in the fifth century by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Comminges. St. Affricus (c. 540), who died in the Rouergue, is wrongly included among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Comminges. Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Comminges were: St. Bertrand of Comminges (1073-1123), grandson of Raymond Taillefer, Count of Toulouse, previously <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of Toulouse, and who built the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Comminges and restored the town; Bertrand de Goth (1295-99), who became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name of <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>; Bertrand de Cosnac (1352-72), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1372; Amelius de Lautrec (1384-90), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1385; Pierre de Foix (1422-64), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1427; John Cibo, who became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1484 under the name of <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a>, for a short time in 1467 held the title of Comminges; Cardinal Amanieu d'Albret, who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Comminges in 1504 and 1507; Cardinal Carlo Caraffa, strangled in the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, was probably <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Comminges about the middle of the sixteenth century; Urban de Saint-Gelais, who in 1586, without outside assistance and with the help of a cannon which he caused to be brought from Toulouse, captured the town from the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Bertrand of Comminges <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was administered with peculiar ceremonies: the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> water was kept in a large silver dove with wings displayed, and enclosed in a <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> surmounting the font; at the moment of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> the dove was lowered, by a pulley, over the head of the child and through its open beak the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> water was poured.
<h2 id="section3">Diocese of Rieux</h2>

<p>The See of Rieux was founded in 1317, by cutting off a portion of the Diocese of Toulouse. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Toulouse, dedicated to St. Stephen, is remarkable for the contrast between its choir and <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>: the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> if Romanesque and was begun in 1211 at the instigation of <a href="../cathen/12670a.htm">Count Raymond VI</a>. the choir is Gothic, and was begun between 1273 and 1286 by Bishop Bertrand de l'Isle, and completed in the fifteenth century. The <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Sernin of Toulouse was begun by St. Sylvius at the end of the fourth century and completed by <a href="../cathen/05731a.htm">St. Exuperius</a>, who transferred to it the remains of St. Sernin, and later those of St. Papoul and St. Honesta, disciples of St. Sernin, and of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Saints Honoratus, Hilary, and Sylvius. <a href="../cathen/05731a.htm">St. Exuperius</a> himself was buried there. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> gave to St. Sernin's the bodies of St. Suzanna of Babylon, of St. Ascicla and her sister St. Victoris, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>. Under Charles the Bald the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the Quattuor Sancti Coronati, Claudius, Nicostratus, Symphorianus, Castor, and their pupil St. Simplicius, were brought from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> who in 1096 accompanied Raymond de Saint Gilles to the East brought back the body of St. Barnabas, the head of St. Bartholomew, and perhaps some wood from the Crib or Manger, a stone from the Holy Sepulchre, and a Crucifix known as the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders'</a> Crucifix. In 1187 Guillaume Taillefer deposited there other <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> acquired in the East, especially the greater portion of the body of <a href="../cathen/06453a.htm">St. George</a>. Louis VIII brought thither the bodies of St. Edmund, King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and St. Gilbert, founder of the Gilbertines. The people themselves brought the body of Saint Gilles to save it from the Abigensians. Alphonse, brother of <a href="../cathen/09368a.htm">Louis IX</a>, last count of Toulouse, on his entry to the town in 1251 deposited in the church a thorn from the Crown of Thorns, which Baldwin II, emperor of Constantinople, had given to St. Louis, and a portion of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a>. About 1366 the body of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, given by <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban V</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, was brought to Toulouse, and preserved in their church until the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, when it was transferred to St. Sernin's.

<p>As early as 1100 a confraternity was formed with twelve superintendents and seventy-two bayles-regents (guardians), in memory of the number of the Apostles and Disciples; they took <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to watch in turn over the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> St. Sernin's on 8 July, 1097, after it has been restored by the canon, St. Raymond; <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a> dedicated an altar there and placed in it <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of SS. Peter and Paul, SS Simon and Jude; <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> granted the same <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> to those who visited the seven altars of St. Sernin's as could be gained by visiting the seven altars of St. Peter's in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The University of Toulouse was founded in 1229, in consequence of a treaty between <a href="../cathen/12670b.htm">Raymond VII</a>, Count of Toulouse, and Blanche of Castile, regent of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; its object was to prevent by higher <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies a recrudescence of <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensianism</a>. <a href="../cathen/12670b.htm">Raymond VIII</a> had to undertake to maintain in Toulouse at his own expense for ten years a certain number of masters of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and grammar. In the beginning the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was looked at askance by the people of the South, who considered it an instrument of repression. The teaching of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> was given over to the Mendicant Friars, but the students who wished to take degrees had to pass some time at the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>. <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> and <a href="../cathen/08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a> were students there. In 1329 <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> reformed its <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>. In 1359 <a href="../cathen/08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a> founded the College of St. Martial for the support of twenty poor students at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>; in 1360 he definitively organized a faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> with masters drawn exclusively from among its former pupils, and granted the chancellor authority to confer degrees. This was the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university's</a> period of prosperity. The new revision of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> after 1394 by a committee nominated by the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a> was fatal to it; from the fifteenth century to the end of the ancien regime the University of Toulouse merely existed.

<p>In 1751 the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a> was merged into that of Toulouse. It was founded in 1332 by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, a native of <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a>, at the instance of the municipal authorities. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> granted the new <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> enjoyed by that of Toulouse, and in fact commanded the latter to communicate its privileges to Cahors. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of erection for Cahors was almost identical with the "Parens Scientiarum" for <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The privileges of <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a> were confirmed in 1368 by Edward, Prince of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, the "Black Prince", and in 1370 by Louis, Duke of Anjou. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> also enjoyed the favour of <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a>, <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a>, <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban V</a>, <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>. In 1460 <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> ordered a revision of its <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>. The main strength of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> lay in its faculty of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> which had as members such noted jurists as Petrus Gregorius (1570), Cujas (1554), and de Lacoste (1594). Of the colleges at <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a> the first was founded by Raymond de Pelegry, canon of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, who provided in his will (1365) for the maintenance of thirteen poor scholars. The College of <a href="../cathen/13107a.htm">Rodez</a> was founded in 1371 by Bernard of <a href="../cathen/13107a.htm">Rodez</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, whose birth-place was Cahors. The College of St. Michel was established (1467) by Jean Rubey, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of Tormes. Among the students of <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a> the most illustrious was <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a>, who entered upon his classical course there in 1663. During the eighteenth century the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> declined, abuses crept in, especially in the matter of granting degrees. The Irish Seminary at Toulouse was founded in 1659 by Anne of Austria to receive twelve <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> students. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Institute of Toulouse was founded in 1877 by Archbishop Desprez and completed in 1879 by the addition of a faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. <a href="../cathen/10048a.htm">Cardinal Mathieu</a> suppressed the chair of law, and only retained about a dozen chairs of literary and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> studies; but under the rectorship of Mgr Batiffol the Institute became, in the early part of the twentieth century, an important centre of sacred studies, and has remained so to this date. Its "Bulletin de litterature ecclesiastique" is highly appreciated in the scientific circles of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>Toulouse is famous for its jeux floraux (floral games). The first meeting dates from early in May, 1324, and was organized by some troubadours. The contest was to laud the Blessed Virgin in a poem. Arnaud Vidal of Castelnaudary was the first to gain a prize. In the fifteenth century the "Clemency" of the Blessed Virgin was the theme of the rival poets; she was styled "Confort del monte Clemensa" (support of the world and clemency). This word "Clemensa" gave rise to the legend which ran that a certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> named Clemence Isaure had instituted the floral games. Guillaume Benoit, councillor of the Parlement of Toulouse (d. 1520), was the first to put <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in this legend. In 1527 Etienne Dolet wrote a poem on Clemence Isaure; and the municipal magistrates of Toulouse, in order to save some <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> from taxation, declared it had been given to the city by Clemence Isaure; they even went to far as to erect a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> to her in the capitol of the town in 1557. Castel in 1633 assailed the legend in a very decisive manner, but it died hard: an alleged poem was quoted on the Duguesclin campaign in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, in which during the fourteenth century reference is made to a Lady Clemence who was no other than Clemence Isaure; then an ode appeared, said to have been recited in 1499; it has recently been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the poem is a seventeenth-century production, and the ode a nineteenth-century <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>. Among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> specially <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in or connected with the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: St. Orentius (Orens), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02067c.htm">Auch</a> (fourth century), to whom the inhabitants of Toulouse attribute an important victory they gained in 422; <a href="../cathen/06393c.htm">St. Gaudentius</a> (Gaudens) (sixth century), a shepherd lad, beheaded by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoth</a>, who gave his name to the town of Montetavezan, now known as Saint-Gaudens; Saint Vidianus (Vezian), <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> in the middle of the sixth century; St. William of Lodeve, or Gellon, Count of Toulouse, who died in 812; Blessed Raymond, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of Toulouse, Blessed Stephen of Narbonne, <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">inquisitor</a>, Blessed Bernard of Rochefort, and Blessed William Arnauld, all of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of Saint Dominic</a>; Blessed Bernard, Bl. Fontanerius, and Bl. Admarus, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, Blessed Garcias and Bl. Peter, <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, massacred by the Abigensians at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> in 1242; the shepherdess <a href="../cathen/06474a.htm">St. Germaine Cousin</a> of Pibrac (1579-1601); <a href="../cathen/08464a.htm">St. John Francis Regis</a>, who joined the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at Toulouse at the age of nineteen (1597-1640).

<p>Among natives of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: <a href="../cathen/11089a.htm">William de Nogaret</a>, the famous legist of <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a> (1260-1313), born at St. Felix de Caraman; the Jurisconsult Cujas, born at Toulouse (1522-92); Abb&eacute; Sicard (1742-1822), founder of deaf-mute instruction, born at Fousseret. The principal places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> are: Notre Dame d'Alet at Montaigut, a shrine <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the eleventh century; Notre Dame d'Avignonet, which dates from the wonders brought by the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the B. Virgin of Avignonet when the church which had been closed for forty years in consequence of the massacres committed by the Abigensians, was once more opened in the thirteenth century; Notre Dame du Bont du Puy at Valentines, a shrine <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the sixteenth century; Notre Dame de Clary at Cessales, dating from the tenth or eleventh century; Notre Dame de Roqueville at Montgiscard. Prior to the application of the Associations Law of 1901 there were in the Diocese of Toulouse: <a href="../cathen/02104a.htm">Augustinians of the Assumption</a>, <a href="../cathen/11244c.htm">Olivetans</a>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a>, Missionaries of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Sacred Heart, and various teaching congregations of Brothers. At the close of the nineteenth century, the congregations of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> had charge of 49 nurseries, 1 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the blind, 1 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of deaf and dumb, 2 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for boys, 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> for girls, 4 detention homes, 9 houses of charity, 15 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 8 district nursing homes, 4 houses of retreat, 2 lunatic asylums. In 1905 at the breach of the Concordat, there were in the Archdiocese of Toulouse 448,481 inhabitants, 44 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 508 auxiliary <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and 61 curacies assisted by the State.
