<p>DIOCESE OF TOURNAI (Latin TURNACUM, TORNACUM; Flemish, DOORNIJK &mdash; TORNACENSIS)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. As early as the second half of the third century St. Piat evangelized Tournai; some writers represent him as the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but this cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. Towards the end of the third century the <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Emperor Maximian</a> rekindled the persecutions, and St. Piat suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. The great barbarian invasions began shortly afterwards, and a wave of Germanic <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> mingled with the Roman <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>, to the destruction of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life. This lasted from the end of the third century till the end of the fifth. But with the progress of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> race Clodion established himself at Tournai; Childeric, his successor, died there in 481. <a href="../cathen/12763b.htm">St. Remigius</a> profited by the good will of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> monarchy to organize the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in the north of Gaul. He confided the <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Diocese of Arras</a> and Cambrai to St. Vaast (Vedastus), and erected the See of Tournai (c. 500), appointing as its titular Eleutherius. It was probably its character of royal city which secured for Tournai this premature creation, but it soon lost its rank of capital by the departure of the Merovingian court. Nevertheless it kept its own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for nearly a century; then about 626 or 627, under the episcopate of St. Achar, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of Tournai and Noyon were united, retaining separate organizations. Tournai then lost the benefit of a privileged situation, and shared the condition of the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, such as Boulogne and Therouanne, <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a> and Cambrai, where the same titular held both sees for five hundred years. It was only in 1146 that Tournai received its own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p>Among its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> may be mentioned: <a href="../cathen/05379a.htm">St. Eleutherius</a> (beginning of sixth century); St. Achar (626-27 &mdash; 1 March, 637-38); St. Eloi (641-60); Simon de Vermandois (1121-46); Walter de Marvis (1219-51), the great founder of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>; <a href="../cathen/14291c.htm">Etienne</a> (1192-1203), godfather of Louis VII and minister of the queen; Andrea Chini Malpiglia (1334-42), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>; Guillaume Filastre (1460-73), chancellor of the Golden Fleece; Michel de Warenghien (1283-91), a very learned doctor; Michel d'Esne (1597-1614), the author of several works. During the Spanish domination (1521-1667) the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> continued to be occupied by natives of the country, but the capture of Tournai by <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> in 1667 caused it to have as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> a series of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a>: <a href="../cathen/03695a.htm">Gilbert de Choiseul du Plessis-Praslain</a> (1670-89); Fran&ccedil;ois de La Salle de Caillebot (1692-1705); Louis Marcel de Co&euml;tlogon (1705-07); Fran&ccedil;ois de Beauveau (1708-13). After the Treaty of Utrecht (173) the French were replaced by Germans: Johann Ernst, Count of L&ouml;wenstein-Wertheim (1713-31); Franz Ernst, Count of Salm-Reifferscheid (1731-1770); Wilhelm Florentine, Prince of Salm-Salm (1776-94).

<p>It will be readily understood that the union of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> with Noyon and the removal thither of the seat of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> had favoured the growth of the power of the chapter. The privilege possessed by the chapter under the old r&eacute;gime of being composed only of nobles and scholars necessarily attracted to it the most distinguished for birth and learning. Illustrious names of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> are inscribed in the registers of the archives or on the tombstones of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, 439 feet long by 216 feet wide, is surmounted by 5 towers 273 feet high. The <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> and <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> are Romanesque (twelfth century), and the choir is primary Gothic, begun in 1242 and finished in 1325. Originally the boundaries of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> must have been those of the <em>Civitas Turnacensium</em> mentioned in the "Notice des Gaules". The prescriptions of councils and the interest of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> both favoured these boundaries, and they were retained throughout the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. The diocese then extended along the left bank of the Schelde from the Scarpe to the North Sea, with the exception of the <em>Vier-Ambachten</em> (Hulst, Axel, Bouchaute, and Assenede), which seem to have always belonged to the Diocese of Utrecht. The Schelde thus formed the boundary between the Dioceses of Tournai and Cambrai, cutting in two the towns of Termonde, <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, Oudenarde, and Tournai itself. The shore of the North Sea between the Schelde and the Yser was wholly included within the perimeter. On the other side of the Yser was the Diocese of Th&eacute;rouanne, which bordered Tournai as far as Ypres. There began the <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Diocese of Arras</a>, which bordered Tournai as far as the confluence of the Scarpe and the Schelde at Mortgne, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. This vast <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was long divided into three archdeaneries and twelve deaneries. The archdeanery of <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> comprised the deaneries of <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, Ardenbourg, and Oudenbourg; the archdeanery of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, the deaneries of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, Roulers, Oudenarde, and Waes; the archdeanery of Tournai, the deaneries of Tournai, Seclin, Helchin, <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a>, and Courtrai.

<p>In 1559 in order to wage more successful <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, King <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II of Spain</a> obtained from Paul VI the erection of a series of new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The ancient Diocese of Tournai was divided, nearly two-thirds of its territory being taken away. The outlines of the archdeaneries of <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> and Ghent formed the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> and Ghent, and six <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> passed to the new Diocese of Ypres. These conditions lasted until the beginning of the nineteenth century. The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> created the Department of Jemappes, which in 1815 became the Province of Hainault, whose boundaries followed those of the Diocese of Tournai, after a concordat between the plenipotentiaries of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> and the consular government of the republic. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tournai retained only two score of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> formerly under his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, but he governed on the right bank of the Schelde a number of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> which, prior to the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, belonged to the <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Diocese of Cambrai</a> (302), Namur (50), and <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> (50).

<p>The Diocese of Tournai, with 1,240,525 inhabitants, has 537 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, divided into 33 deaneries: Antoing (21 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>), Ath (12), Beaumont (17), Beloeil (15), Binche (18), Boussu (18), Celles (14), Charleroi (18), Ch&acirc;telet (27), Chi&egrave;vres (23), Chimay (22), Dour (18), Ellezelles (6), Enghien (12), Fountain-L'Ev&ecirc;que (20), Frasnes-lez-Buissenal (14), Gosselies (20), La Louviere (15), Lens (23), Lessines (12), Leuze (17), Merbes-le-Ch&acirc;teau (17), Mons (Ste-Elisabeth, 9), Mons (Ste-Waudru, 10), P&acirc;turages (17), P&eacute;ruvelz (12), Roeulx (16), Seneffe (21), Soignies (11), Templeuve (13), Thuin (16), Tournai (Notre-Dame, 14), Tournai (St-Brice, 13).

<p>Eight <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a> prepare young men for <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies in a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, or for a liberal course in a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>.
